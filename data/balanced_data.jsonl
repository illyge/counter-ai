{"question_id":11227809,"answer":"An answer for quick and simple understanding (read the others for more details)\nThis concept is called branch prediction\nBranch prediction is an optimization technique that predicts the path the code will take before it is known with certainty. This is important because during the code execution, the machine prefetches several code statements and stores them in the pipeline.\nThe problem arises in conditional branching, where there are two possible paths or parts of the code that can be executed.\nWhen the prediction was true, the optimization technique worked out.\nWhen the prediction was false, to explain it in a simple way, the code statement stored in the pipeline gets proved wrong and the actual code has to be completely reloaded, which takes up a lot of time.\nAs common sense suggests, predictions of something sorted are way more accurate than predictions of something unsorted.\nbranch prediction visualisation:\nsorted\n\nunsorted\n\n","target":0,"question":"Why is processing a sorted array faster than processing an unsorted array?\n\nHere is a piece of C++ code that shows some very peculiar behavior.\nFor some reason, sorting the data (before the timed region) miraculously makes the primary loop almost six times faster:\n#include <algorithm>\n#include <ctime>\n#include <iostream>\n\nint main()\n{\n    \/\/ Generate data\n    const unsigned arraySize = 32768;\n    int data[arraySize];\n\n    for (unsigned c = 0; c < arraySize; ++c)\n        data[c] = std::rand() % 256;\n\n    \/\/ !!!

{"question_id":244777,"answer":"I searched all pages of answers, and none mention this about JSON syntax highlighting on GitHub or on Stack Overflow, although this answer comes close.\nSome JSON parsers accept C++-style comments. To trigger them when writing markdown on GitHub or Stack Overflow, for instance, you can specify the syntax highlighting type as jsonc. Example:\nThis:\n```jsonc\n\/\/ C++-style comment here\n{\n    \"*.md\": {\n        \"softwrap\": true\n    },\n    \"colorcolumn\": 80,\n    \"savecursor\": true,\n    \"scrollbar\": true,\n    \"scrollspeed\": 5,\n    \"softwrap\": true,\n    \"wordwrap\": true\n}\n```\n\nProduces this:\n\/\/ C++-style comment here\n{\n    \"*.md\": {\n        \"softwrap\": true\n    },\n    \"colorcolumn\": 80,\n    \"savecursor\": true,\n    \"scrollbar\": true,\n    \"scrollspeed\": 5,\n    \"softwrap\": true,\n    \"wordwrap\": true\n}\n\nAs the answer I reference above mentions, you can then parse JSON which has C (\/* *\/) and C++ (\/\/) style comments using the amazing nlohmann json C++ library.\nIt is here: https:\/\/github.com\/nlohmann\/json\nThe single header file you need is here: https:\/\/github.com\/nlohmann\/json\/blob\/develop\/include\/nlohmann\/json.hpp\nThat library says this: https:\/\/github.com\/nlohmann\/json#comments-in-json:\n\nComments in JSON\nThis library does not support comments by default. It does so for three reasons:\n\nComments are not part of the JSON specification. You may argue that \/\/ or \/* *\/ are allowed in JavaScript, but JSON is not JavaScript.\nThis was not an oversight: Douglas Crockford wrote on this in May 2012:\n\n\nI removed comments from JSON because I saw people were using them to hold parsing directives, a practice which would have destroyed interoperability.  I know that the lack of comments makes some people sad, but it shouldn't.\n\n\nSuppose you are using JSON to keep configuration files, which you would like to annotate. Go ahead and insert all the comments you like. Then pipe it through JSMin before handing it to your JSON parser.\n\n\nIt is dangerous for interoperability if some libraries would add comment support while others don't. Please check The Harmful Consequences of the Robustness Principle on this.\n\nHowever, you can pass set parameter ignore_comments to true in the parse function to ignore \/\/ or \/* *\/ comments. Comments will then be treated as whitespace.\n\nignore_comments is a bool and is the last parameter passed to the nlohmann::json::parse() function.

{"question_id":79923,"answer":"\nWhere and what are they (physically in a real computer's memory)?\n\nANSWER: Both are in RAM.\nASIDE:\nRAM is like a desk and HDDs\/SSDs (permanent storage) are like bookshelves. To read anything, you must have a book open on your desk, and you can only have as many books open as fit on your desk. To get a book, you pull it from your bookshelf and open it on your desk. To return a book, you close the book on your desk and return it to its bookshelf.\nStack and heap are names we give to two ways compilers store different kinds of data in the same place (i.e. in RAM).\n\nWhat is their scope?\nWhat determines the size of each of them?\nWhat makes one faster?\n\nANSWER:\n\nThe stack is for static (fixed size) data\na. At compile time, the compiler reads the variable types used in your code.\ni. It allocates a fixed amount of memory for these variables.\nii. This size of this memory cannot grow.\nb. The memory is contiguous (a single block), so access is sometimes faster than the heap\nc. An object placed on the stack that grows in memory during runtime beyond the size of the stack causes a stack overflow error\n\nThe heap is for dynamic (changing size) data\na. The amount of memory is limited only by the amount of empty space available in RAM\ni. The amount used can grow or shrink as needed at runtime\nb. Since items are allocated on the heap by finding empty space wherever it exists in RAM, data is not always in a contiguous section, which sometimes makes access slower than the stack\nc. Programmers manually put items on the heap with the new keyword and MUST manually deallocate this memory when they are finished using it.\ni. Code that repeatedly allocates new memory without deallocating it when it is no longer needed leads to a memory leak.\n\n\nASIDE:\nThe stack and heap were not primarily introduced to improve speed; they were introduced to handle memory overflow. The first concern regarding use of the stack vs. the heap should be whether memory overflow will occur. If an object is intended to grow in size to an unknown amount (like a linked list or an object whose members can hold an arbitrary amount of data), place it on the heap. As far as possible, use the C++ standard library (STL) containers vector, map, and list as they are memory and speed efficient and added to make your life easier (you don't need to worry about memory allocation\/deallocation).\nAfter getting your code to run, if you find it is running unacceptably slow, then go back and refactor your code and see if it can be programmed more efficiently. It may turn out the problem has nothing to do with the stack or heap directly at all (e.g. use an iterative algorithm instead of a recursive one, look at I\/O vs. CPU-bound tasks, perhaps add multithreading or multiprocessing).\nI say sometimes slower\/faster above because the speed of the program might not have anything to do with items being allocated on the stack or heap.\n\nTo what extent are they controlled by the OS or language run-time?\n\nANSWER:\n\nThe stack size is determined at compile time by the compiler.\n\nThe heap size varies during runtime. (The heap works with the OS during runtime to allocate memory.)\n\n\nASIDE:\nBelow is a little more about control and compile-time vs. runtime operations.\nEach computer has a unique instruction set architecture (ISA), which are its hardware commands (e.g. \"MOVE\", \"JUMP\", \"ADD\", etc.).\n\nAn OS is nothing more than a resource manager (controls how\/when\/ and where to use memory, processors, devices, and information).\n\nThe ISA of the OS is called the bare machine and the remaining commands are called the extended machine. The kernel is the first layer of the extended machine. It controls things like\n\ndetermining what tasks get to use a processor (the scheduler),\nhow much memory or how many hardware registers to allocate to a task (the dispatcher), and\nthe order in which tasks should be performed (the traffic controller).\n\n\nWhen we say \"compiler\", we generally mean the compiler, assembler, and linker together\n\nThe compiler turns source code into assembly language and passes it to the assembler,\nThe assembler turns the assembly language into machine code (ISA commands), and passes it to the linker\nThe linker takes all machine code (possibly generated from multiple source files) and combines it into one program.\n\n\nThe machine code gets passed to the kernel when executed, which determines when it should run and take control, but the machine code itself contains ISA commands for requesting files, requesting memory, etc. So the code issues ISA commands, but everything has to pass by the kernel.\n\n\n","target":0,"question":"Which JSON content type do I use?\n\n\nWhat are the stack and heap?\nWhere are they located physically in a computer's memory?\nTo what extent are they controlled by the OS or language run-time?\nWhat is their scope?\nWhat determines their sizes?\nWhat makes one faster?\n\n"}

{"question_id":111102,"answer":"\n  A closure is a function having access to the parent scope, even after the parent function has closed.\n\n\nSo basically a closure is a function of another function. We can say like a child function.\n\n\n  A closure is an inner function that has access to the outer\n  (enclosing) function\u2019s variables\u2014scope chain. The closure has three\n  scope chains: it has access to its own scope (variables defined\n  between its curly brackets), it has access to the outer function\u2019s\n  variables, and it has access to the global variables.\n  \n  The inner function has access not only to the outer function\u2019s\n  variables but also to the outer function\u2019s parameters. Note that the\n  inner function cannot call the outer function\u2019s arguments object,\n  however, even though it can call the outer function\u2019s parameters\n  directly.\n  \n  You create a closure by adding a function inside another function.\n\n\nAlso, it's very useful method which is used in many famous frameworks including Angular, Node.js and jQuery:\n\n\n  Closures are used extensively in Node.js; they are workhorses in\n  Node.js\u2019 asynchronous, non-blocking architecture. Closures are also\n  frequently used in jQuery and just about every piece of JavaScript\n  code you read.\n\n\nBut how the closures look like in a real-life coding?\nLook at this simple sample code:\n\nfunction showName(firstName, lastName) {\n      var nameIntro = \"Your name is \";\n      \/\/ this inner function has access to the outer function's variables, including the parameter\n      function makeFullName() {\n          return nameIntro + firstName + \" \" + lastName;\n      }\n      return makeFullName();\n  }\n\n  console.log(showName(\"Michael\", \"Jackson\")); \/\/ Your name is Michael Jackson\n\n\nAlso, this is classic closure way in jQuery which every javascript and jQuery developers used it a lot:\n\n$(function() {\n    var selections = [];\n    $(\".niners\").click(function() { \/\/ this closure has access to the selections variable\n        selections.push(this.prop(\"name\")); \/\/ update the selections variable in the outer function's scope\n    });\n});\n\n\nBut why we use closures? when we use it in an actual programming?\nwhat are the practical use of closures? the below is a good explanation and example by MDN:\n\nPractical closures\n\n\n  Closures are useful because they let you associate some data (the\n  lexical environment) with a function that operates on that data. This\n  has obvious parallels to object oriented programming, where objects\n  allow us to associate some data (the object's properties) with one or\n  more methods.\n  \n  Consequently, you can use a closure anywhere that you might normally\n  use an object with only a single method.\n  \n  Situations where you might want to do this are particularly common on\n  the web. Much of the code we write in front-end JavaScript is\n  event-based \u2014 we define some behavior, then attach it to an event that\n  is triggered by the user (such as a click or a keypress). Our code is\n  generally attached as a callback: a single function which is executed\n  in response to the event.\n  \n  For instance, suppose we wish to add some buttons to a page that\n  adjust the text size. One way of doing this is to specify the\n  font-size of the body element in pixels, then set the size of the\n  other elements on the page (such as headers) using the relative em\n  unit:\n\n\nRead the code below and run the code to see how closure help us here to easily make separate functions for each sections:\n\n\r\n\r\n\/\/javascript\r\nfunction makeSizer(size) {\r\n  return function() {\r\n    document.body.style.fontSize = size + 'px';\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n\r\nvar size12 = makeSizer(12);\r\nvar size14 = makeSizer(14);\r\nvar size16 = makeSizer(16);\r\n\r\ndocument.getElementById('size-12').onclick = size12;\r\ndocument.getElementById('size-14').onclick = size14;\r\ndocument.getElementById('size-16').onclick = size16;\r\n\/*css*\/\r\nbody {\r\n  font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\r\n  font-size: 12px;\r\n}\r\n\r\nh1 {\r\n  font-size: 1.5em;\r\n}\r\n\r\nh2 {\r\n  font-size: 1.2em;\r\n}\r\n<!--html><!-->\r\n<p>Some paragraph text<\/p>\r\n<h1>some heading 1 text<\/h1>\r\n<h2>some heading 2 text<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"#\" id=\"size-12\">12<\/a>\r\n<a href=\"#\" id=\"size-14\">14<\/a>\r\n<a href=\"#\" id=\"size-16\">16<\/a>\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nFor further study about closures, I recommend you to visit this page by MDN:\nhttps:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en\/docs\/Web\/JavaScript\/Closures\n","target":0,"question":"What and where are the stack and heap?\n\nHow would you explain JavaScript closures to someone with a knowledge of the concepts they consist of (for example functions, variables and the like), but does not understand closures themselves?\n\nI have seen the Scheme example given on Wikipedia, but unfortunately it did not help.\n"}

The method changes the x and y coordinates of the object that circle references (that is, myCircle) by 23 and 56, respectively. These changes will persist when the method returns. Then circle is assigned a reference to a new Circle object with x = y = 0. This reassignment has no permanence, however, because the reference was passed in by value and cannot change.

The output of the line\nconsole.log('Finally, the result: ' + result);\nwhich I thought would be printed last, is actually printed before the\nother output! \u2013 And it doesn't contain the result: it just prints undefined.\n1\nHow come?\nA helpful insight\nI distinctly remember my first aha! moment on how to understand asynchronous\ncalls.\nIt was this comment saying:\nyou actually don't want to get the data out of a callback;\nyou want to get your data-needing action into the callback!\n2\nThis is obvious in the example above.\nBut is it still possible to write code after the asynchronous call that\ndeals with the response once it has completed?\n2. Plain JavaScript and a callback function\nThe answer is yes! \u2013 It is possible.\nOne alternative is the use of a callback function in a continuation-passing\nstyle:\n3\n\r\n\r\nconst url = 'https:\/\/jsonplaceholder.typicode.com\/todos\/2';\n\nfunction asynchronousCall (callback) {\n  const request = new XMLHttpRequest();\n  request.open('GET', url);\n  request.send();\n  request.onload = function () {\n    if (request.readyState === request.DONE) {\n      console.log('The request is done.

THE END!');\n});\n\nconsole.log('LAST in the code, but executed FIRST!');\r\n.as-console-wrapper { max-height: 100% !important; top: 0; }\r\n\r\n\r\n\nNote how the function asynchronousCall is void. It returns nothing.\nInstead, by calling asynchronousCall with an anonymous callback function\n(asynchronousCall(function (result) {...), this function executes the\ndesired actions on the result, but only after the request has completed \u2013\nwhen the responseText is available.\nRunning the above snippet shows how I will probably not want to write any code\nafter the asyncronous call (such as the line\nLAST in the code, but executed FIRST!).\nWhy? \u2013 Because such code will\nhappen before the asyncronous call delivers any response data.\nDoing so is bound to cause confusion when comparing the code with the output.\n3. Promise with .then() \u2013 or async\/await\nThe .then() construct was introduced in the ECMA-262 6th Edition in June\n2015, and the async\/await construct was introduced in the ECMA-262\n8th Edition in June 2017.\nThe code below is still plain JavaScript, replacing the old-school\nXMLHttpRequest with Fetch.\n4\n\r\n\r\nfetch('http:\/\/api.icndb.com\/jokes\/random')\n  .then(response => response.json())\n  .then(responseBody => {\n    console.log('.then() - the response body:');\n    console.log(JSON.stringify(responseBody) + '\\n\\n');\n  });\n\nasync function receiveAndAwaitPromise () {\n  const responseBody =\n    (await fetch('http:\/\/api.icndb.com\/jokes\/random')).json();\n  console.log('async\/await:');\n  console.log(JSON.stringify(await responseBody) + '\\n\\n');\n}\n\nreceiveAndAwaitPromise();\r\n.as-console-wrapper { max-height: 100% !important; top: 0; }\r\n\r\n\r\n\nA word of warning is warranted if you decide to go with the async\/await\nconstruct. Note in the above snippet how await is needed in two places.\nIf forgotten in the first place, there will be no output. If forgotten in the\nsecond place, the only output will be the empty object, {}\n(or [object Object] or [object Promise]).\nForgetting the async prefix of the function is maybe the worst of all \u2013 the\noutput will be \"SyntaxError: missing ) in parenthetical\" \u2013 no mentioning of\nthe missing async keyword.\n4. Promise.all \u2013 array of URLs 5\nSuppose we need to request a whole bunch of URLs.\nI could send one request, wait till it responds, then send the next request,\nwait till it responds, and so on ...\nAargh! \u2013 That could take a loong time. Wouldn't it be better if I could send\nthem all at once, and then wait no longer than it takes for the slowest\nresponse to arrive?\nAs a simplified example, I will use:\nurls = ['https:\/\/jsonplaceholder.typicode.com\/todos\/2',\n        'https:\/\/jsonplaceholder.typicode.com\/todos\/3']\n\nThe JSONs of the two URLs:\n{\"userId\":1,\"id\":2,\"title\":\"quis ut nam facilis et officia qui\",\n \"completed\":false}\n{\"userId\":1,\"id\":3,\"title\":\"fugiat veniam minus\",\"completed\":false}\n\nThe goal is to get an array of objects, where each object contains the title\nvalue from the corresponding URL.\nTo make it a little more interesting, I will assume that there is already an\narray of names that I want the array of URL results (the titles) to be\nmerged with:\nnamesonly = ['two', 'three']\n\nThe desired output is a mashup combining namesonly and urls into an\narray of objects:\n[{\"name\":\"two\",\"loremipsum\":\"quis ut nam facilis et officia qui\"},\n{\"name\":\"three\",\"loremipsum\":\"fugiat veniam minus\"}]\n\nwhere I have changed the name of title to loremipsum.\n\r\n\r\nconst namesonly = ['two','three'];\n\nconst urls = ['https:\/\/jsonplaceholder.typicode.com\/todos\/2',\n  'https:\/\/jsonplaceholder.typicode.com\/todos\/3'];\n\nPromise.all(urls.map(url => fetch(url)\n  .then(response => response.json())\n  .then(responseBody => responseBody.title)))\n  .then(titles => {\n    const names = namesonly.map(value => ({ name: value }));\n    console.log('names: ' + JSON.stringify(names));\n    const latins = titles.map(value => ({ loremipsum: value }));\n    console.log('latins:\\n' + JSON.stringify(latins));\n    const result =\n      names.map((item, i) => Object.assign({}, item, latins[i]));\n    console.log('result:\\n' + JSON.stringify(result));\n  });\r\n.as-console-wrapper { max-height: 100% !important; top: 0; }\r\n\r\n\r\n\nAll the above examples are short and succinctly convey how asynchronous calls\nmay be used on toyish APIs.\nUsing small APIs works well to explain concepts and working code, but the\nexamples might be a bit of dry runs.\nThe next section will show a more realistic example on how APIs may be\ncombined to create a more interesting output.\n5.

{"question_id":630453,"answer":"POST vs PUT\nIn the case of POST vs PUT, its easy to decide which is used. The format of the URI decides:\nPOST\nhttp:\/\/example.com\/form\n\nPUT\nhttp:\/\/example.com\/form\/568\n\n\nThe URI in a POST request identifies the resource that will handle the\nenclosed entity. In contrast, the URI in a PUT request identifies the\nentity enclosed with the request.\n\nIf the URL does NOT represent a UNIQUE IDENTIFIER, it's a POST. The POST can now create multiple duplicate records, modify, even delete one or more entities as long as the URI-URL doesn't represent a single identifiable \"entity\". Why? Using a generic URL without a unique identifier would fail the PUT design that says a \"URI in a PUT request identifies the entity enclosed with the request\".\nUNIQUE IDENTIFIER\nIt makes sense if you think about a PUT. Its just an identifier, and the URL was designed to represent billions and billions of unique addresses online. The PUT is just an extension of that, like a phone number, social security number, GUID, blockchain private key, etc. There should be only one in the Universe, right?\nPUT needs to know this address points to one entity!\nhttp:\/\/example.com\/097243523581549126143698\n\nPUT should only be routed as a PUT on the server if the URL is an identifier, indicating the call may create, change, replace, etc a specific record, but only add that record or entity one time. That fulfills the \"idempotent\" requirement. This then purifies and simplifies the call for PUT as an action tied to an URI that represents an entity. That can of course take many URL forms than the ones I am showing. But it then demands that your URL system follow strict conventions, whatever identifying URL you end up using.\nBROWSERS DO NOT SUPPORT \"PUT\" or \"DELETE\"!\nDid you know that HTML Form method attributes in browsers the past 20+ years have only supported POST and GET, and do not support PUT?\nPOST and GET work ok...\n<form id=\"form1\" name=\"form1\" method=\"get\" action=\"\/form\">...<\/form>\n<form id=\"form2\" name=\"form2\" method=\"post\" action=\"\/form\">...<\/form>\n\nPUT NOT SUPPORTED!\n<form id=\"form3\" name=\"form3\" method=\"put\" action=\"\/form\">...<\/form>\n\nDELETE NOT SUPPORTED!\n<form id=\"form4\" name=\"form4\" method=\"delete\" action=\"\/form\">...<\/form>\n\nCrazy, huh?\nWhen a browser user submits data to a server, nobody knows if they are creating, deleting, or modifying data. A POST can add or change an entity just like a PUT can, right? So, other than the identifying URL, the right action or HTTP Verb to use is still unknown! Therefore you have to make up your own conventions and tricks to decide.\nSo when a form pushes data to the server, they are not honoring the HTTP VERBS as they were meant to be used. If you set up your server and HTML to follow conventions they would fail. AJAX or other JavaScript REST calls could override conventions and send a PUT meant for a POST for a given URL that is not an identifier type.\nSo again, it comes down to the Unique Identifier; the structure of the URL \"posted\" back from the browser. The server then must look at that URL carefully (plus any buttons pressed like \"add\", \"delete\", \"update\" etc) to decide what the right verb is, then route the POST or PUT or DELETE etc. to the right server handler. This then honors the Post vs Put design.\nThe fact is, PUT was always tied to the URL identifier, not the logic in your client-side code. But it's the flawed nature of today's client-side model with its broken HTML5 design, plus the corrupting nature of today's thick-client JavaScript API calls and other circus-tricks, that have polluted what should have been a very simple HTTP Standard created long ago by very forward looking people.\n","target":0,"question":"How do JavaScript closures work?\n\nAccording to RFC 2616, \u00a7 9.5, POST is used to create a resource:\n\nThe POST method is used to request that the origin server accept the entity enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the resource identified by the Request-URI in the Request-Line.\n\nAccording to RFC 2616, \u00a7 9.6, PUT is used to create or replace a resource:\n\nThe PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers to an already existing resource, the enclosed entity SHOULD be considered as a modified version of the one residing on the origin server. If the Request-URI does not point to an existing resource, and that URI is capable of being defined as a new resource by the requesting user agent, the origin server can create the resource with that URI.\n\nSo which HTTP method should be used to create a resource? Or should both be supported?\n"}

(Try them with the challenged case of the above snippet.)\nMaybe some tricky methods like .split('searchValue').join('replaceValue') or some well managed functions give same result, but definitely with much lower performance than native replaceAll() \/ polyfill replaceAll() \/ replace() + RegExp\n\nOther methods of polyfill assignment\nNaive, but supports even older browsers (be better to avoid)\nFor example, we can support IE7+ too, by not using Object.defineProperty() and using my old naive assignment method:\nif (!String.prototype.replaceAll) {\n    String.prototype.replaceAll = function(search, replace) { \/\/ <-- Naive method for assignment\n        \/\/ ... (Polyfill code Here)\n    }\n}\n\nAnd it should work well for basic uses on IE7+. \nBut as here @sebastian-simon explained about, that can make secondary problems in case of more advanced uses. E.g.:\nfor (var k in 'hi') console.log(k);\n\/\/ 0\n\/\/ 1\n\/\/ replaceAll  <-- ?\n\nFully trustable, but heavy\nIn fact, my suggested option is a little optimistic. Like we trusted the environment (browser and Node.js), it is definitely for around 2012-2021. Also it is a standard\/famous one, so it does not require any special consideration.\nBut there can be even older browsers or some unexpected problems, and polyfills still can support and solve more possible environment problems. So in case we need the maximum support that is possible, we can use polyfill libraries like:\nhttps:\/\/polyfill.io\/\nSpecially for replaceAll:\n<script src=\"https:\/\/polyfill.io\/v3\/polyfill.min.js?features=String.prototype.replaceAll\"><\/script>\n\n","target":0,"question":"What is the difference between String and string in C#?\n\nGiven a string:\ns = \"Test abc test test abc test test test abc test test abc\";\n\nThis seems to only remove the first occurrence of abc in the string above:\ns = s.replace('abc', '');\n\nHow do I replace all occurrences of it?\n"}

A URI can be used as a locator, a name, or both. If a URI is a locator, it describes a resource\u2019s primary access mechanism. If a URI is a name, it identifies a resource by giving it a unique name. The exact specifications of syntax and semantics of a URI depend on the used Scheme that is defined by the characters before the first colon. [RFC3986]\n\nURN\n\nA Uniform Resource Name is a URI in the scheme urn intended to serve as persistent, location-independent, resource identifier. Historically, the term also referred to any URI. [RFC3986] A URN consists of a Namespace Identifier (NID) and a Namespace Specific String (NSS): urn:: The syntax and semantics of the NSS is specific specific for each NID. Beside the registered NIDs, there exist several more NIDs, that did not go through the official registration process. [RFC2141]\n\nURL\n\nA Uniform Resource Locator is a URI that, in addition to identifying a resource, provides a means of locating the resource by describing its primary access mechanism [RFC3986]. As there is no exact definition of URL by means of a set of Schemes, \"URL is a useful but informal concept\", usually referring to a subset of URIs that do not contain URNs [RFC3305].\n\nIRI\n\nAn Internationalized Resource Identifier is defined similarly to a URI, but the character set is extended to the Universal Coded Character Set. Therefore, it can contain any Latin and non Latin characters except the reserved characters. Instead of extending the definition of URI, the term IRI was introduced to allow for a clear distinction and avoid incompatibilities. IRIs are meant to replace URIs in identifying resources in situations where the Universal Coded Character Set is supported. By definition, every URI is an IRI. Furthermore, there is a defined surjective mapping of IRIs to URIs: Every IRI can be mapped to exactly one URI, but different IRIs might map to the same URI. Therefore, the conversion back from a URI to an IRI may not produce the original IRI. [RFC3987]\n\nSummarizing we can say:\n\nIRI is a superset of URI (IRI \u2283 URI)\nURI is a superset of URL (URI \u2283 URL)\nURI is a superset of URN (URI \u2283 URN)\nURL and URN are disjoint (URL \u2229 URN = \u2205)\n\n\nConclusions for Semantic Web Issues\n\nRDF explicitly allows to use IRIs to name entities [RFC3987]. This means that we can use almost every character in entity names. On the other hand, we often have to deal with early state software. Thus, it is not unlikely to run into problems using non ASCII characters. Therefore, I suggest to avoid non URI names for entities and recommend to use http URIs [LINKED-DATA]. To put it briefly: only use URLs to name your entities. Of course, we can refer to existing entities named by a URN. However, we should avoid to newly create this kind of identifiers.\n","target":0,"question":"How to disable text selection highlighting\n\nWhat is the difference between a URL, a URI, and a URN?\n"}

{"question_id":4456438,"answer":" Tracking it down \n\nAt first I thought this was a coercion bug where null was getting coerced to \"null\" and a test of \"null\" == null was passing. It's not. I was close, but so very, very wrong. Sorry about that!\n\nI've since done lots of fiddling on wonderfl.net and tracing through the code in mx.rpc.xml.*. At line 1795 of XMLEncoder (in the 3.5 source), in setValue, all of the XMLEncoding boils down to \n\ncurrentChild.appendChild(xmlSpecialCharsFilter(Object(value)));\n\n\nwhich is essentially the same as:\n\ncurrentChild.appendChild(\"null\");\n\n\nThis code, according to my original fiddle, returns an empty XML element. But why?\n\n Cause \n\nAccording to commenter Justin Mclean on bug report FLEX-33664, the following is the culprit (see last two tests in my fiddle which verify this):\n\nvar thisIsNotNull:XML = <root>null<\/root>;\nif(thisIsNotNull == null){\n    \/\/ always branches here, as (thisIsNotNull == null) strangely returns true\n    \/\/ despite the fact that thisIsNotNull is a valid instance of type XML\n}\n\n\nWhen currentChild.appendChild is passed the string \"null\", it first converts it to a root XML element with text null, and then tests that element against the null literal. This is a weak equality test, so either the XML containing null is coerced to the null type, or the null type is coerced to a root xml element containing the string \"null\", and the test passes where it arguably should fail. One fix might be to always use strict equality tests when checking XML (or anything, really) for \"nullness.\"\n\nSolution\nThe only reasonable workaround I can think of, short of fixing this bug in every damn version of ActionScript, is to test fields for \"null\" and escape them as CDATA values. \n\nCDATA values are the most appropriate way to mutate an entire text value that would otherwise cause encoding\/decoding problems. Hex encoding, for instance, is meant for individual characters. CDATA values are preferred when you're escaping the entire text of an element. The biggest reason for this is that it maintains human readability.\n","target":0,"question":"How do I get the directory where a Bash script is located from within the script itself?\n\nWe have an employee whose surname is Null.

{"question_id":14994391,"answer":"AngularJS and jQuery:\n\nAngularJs and JQuery are completely different at every level except the JQLite functionality and you will see it once you start learning the AngularJs core features (I explained it below).\n\nAngularJs is a client side framework that offers to build the independent client side application. JQuery is a client side library that play around the DOM.\n\nAngularJs Cool Principle - If you want some changes on your UI think from model data change perspective. Change your data and UI will re-render itself. You need not to play around DOM each time unless and until it is hardly required and that should also be handled through Angular Directives.\n\nTo answer this question, I want to share my experience on the first enterprise application with AngularJS. These are the most awesome features that Angular provide where we start changing our jQuery mindset and we get the Angular like a framework and not the library.\n\nTwo-way data binding is amazing: \nI had a grid with all functionality UPDATE, DELTE, INSERT. I have a data object that binds the grid's model using ng-repeat. You only need to write a single line of simple JavaScript code for delete and insert and that's it. grid automatically updates as the grid model changes instantly. Update functionality is real time, no code for it.\nYou feel amazing!!!\n\nReusable directives are super:\nWrite directives in one place and use it throughout the application. OMG!!! I used these directive for paging, regex, validations, etc. It is really cool!\n\nRouting is strong:\nIt's up to your implementation how you want to use it, but it requires very few lines of code to route the request to specify HTML and controller (JavaScript)\n\nControllers are great:\nControllers take care of their own HTML, but this separation works well for common functionality well as. If you want to call the same function on the click of a button on master HTML, just write the same function name in each controller and write individual code.\n\nPlugins:\nThere are many other similar features like showing an overlay in your app. You don't need to write code for it, just use an overlay plugin available as wc-overlay, and this will automatically take care of all XMLHttpRequest (XHR) requests.\n\nIdeal for RESTful architecture:\nBeing a complete frameworks makes AngularJS great to work with a RESTful architecture. To call REST CRUD APIs is very easier and \n\nServices: Write common codes using services and less code in controllers. Sevices can be used to share common functionalities among the controllers.\n\nExtensibility: Angular has extended the HTML directives using angular directives. Write expressions inside html and evaluate them on runtime.

Not as important as the ones in the first book, but still good to know.\n\n\n\nExceptional C++\nHerb Sutter\nPresented as a set of puzzles, this has one of the best and thorough discussions of the proper resource management and exception safety in C++ through Resource Acquisition is Initialization (RAII) in addition to in-depth coverage of a variety of other topics including the pimpl idiom, name lookup, good class design, and the C++ memory model.\n[Review]\n\n\nMore Exceptional C++\nHerb Sutter\nCovers additional exception safety topics not covered in Exceptional C++, in addition to discussion of effective object-oriented programming in C++ and correct use of the STL.\n[Review]\n\n\nExceptional C++ Style\nHerb Sutter\nDiscusses generic programming, optimization, and resource management; this book also has an excellent exposition of how to write modular code in C++ by using non-member functions and the single responsibility principle.\n[Review]\n\n\nC++ Coding Standards\nHerb Sutter and Andrei Alexandrescu\n\u201cCoding standards\u201d here doesn't mean \u201chow many spaces should I indent my code?\u201d  This book contains 101 best practices, idioms, and common pitfalls that can help you to write correct, understandable, and efficient C++ code.\n[Review]\n\n\nC++ Templates: The Complete Guide\nDavid Vandevoorde and Nicolai M. Josuttis\nThis is the book about templates as they existed before C++11.  It covers everything from the very basics to some of the most advanced template metaprogramming and explains every detail of how templates work (both conceptually and at how they are implemented) and discusses many common pitfalls.  Has excellent summaries of the One Definition Rule (ODR) and overload resolution in the appendices. A second edition covering C++11, C++14 and C++17 has been already published.\n[Review]\n\n\nC++ 17 - The Complete Guide\nNicolai M. Josuttis\nThis book describes all the new features introduced in the C++17 Standard covering everything from the simple ones like 'Inline Variables', 'constexpr if' all the way up to 'Polymorphic Memory Resources' and 'New and Delete with over aligned Data'.\n[Review]\n\n\nC++ 20 - The Complete Guide\nNicolai M. Josuttis\nThis book presents all the new language and library features of C++20. It covers the motivation and context of each new feature with examples and background information. The focus is on how these features impact day-to-day programming, what it means to combine them, and how to benefit from C++20 in practice. (Note that this book was published step-by-step, and the first edition is now complete.)\n\n\n\nC++ in Action\nBartosz Milewski\nThis book explains C++ and its features by building an application from ground up.\n[Review]\n\n\nFunctional Programming in C++\nIvan \u010cuki\u0107\nThis book introduces functional programming techniques to modern C++ (C++11 and later). A very nice read for those who want to apply functional programming paradigms to C++.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced\n\n\n\n\nBook\nAuthor(s)\nDescription\nreview\n\n\n\n\nModern C++ Design\nAndrei Alexandrescu\nA groundbreaking book on advanced generic programming techniques.  Introduces policy-based design, type lists, and fundamental generic programming idioms then explains how many useful design patterns (including small object allocators, functors, factories, visitors, and multi-methods) can be implemented efficiently, modularly, and cleanly using generic programming.\n[Review]\n\n\nC++ Template Metaprogramming\nDavid Abrahams and Aleksey Gurtovoy\n\n\n\n\nC++ Concurrency In Action\nAnthony Williams\nA book covering C++11 concurrency support including the thread library, the atomics library, the C++ memory model, locks and mutexes, as well as issues of designing and debugging multithreaded applications. A second edition covering C++14 and C++17 has already been published.\n[Review]\n\n\nAdvanced C++ Metaprogramming\nDavide Di Gennaro\nA pre-C++11 manual of TMP techniques, focused more on practice than theory.  There are a ton of snippets in this book, some of which are made obsolete by type traits, but the techniques, are nonetheless useful to know.  If you can put up with the quirky formatting\/editing, it is easier to read than Alexandrescu, and arguably, more rewarding.  For more experienced developers, there is a good chance that you may pick up something about a dark corner of C++ (a quirk) that usually only comes about through extensive experience.\n\n\n\nLarge Scale C++ volume I, Process and architecture (2020)\nJohn Lakos\nPart one of a three-part series extending the older book 'Large Scale C++ Design'. Lakos explains battle-tested techniques to manage very big C++ software projects. If you work in a big C++ software project this is a great read, detailing the relationship between physical and logical structure, strategies for components, and their reuse.\n[Review]\n\n\n\n\nReference Style - All Levels\n\n\n\n\nBook\nAuthor(s)\nDescription\nreview\n\n\n\n\nThe C++ Programming Language\nBjarne Stroustrup (updated for C++11)\nThe classic introduction to C++ by its creator. Written to parallel the classic K&R, this indeed reads very much like it and covers just about everything from the core language to the standard library, to programming paradigms to the language's philosophy.\n[Review] Note: All releases of the C++ standard are tracked in the question \"Where do I find the current C or C++ standard documents?\".\n\n\nC++ Standard Library Tutorial and Reference\nNicolai Josuttis (updated for C++11)\nThe introduction and reference for the C++ Standard Library. The second edition (released on April 9, 2012) covers C++11.\n[Review]\n\n\nThe C++ IO Streams and Locales\nAngelika Langer and Klaus Kreft\nThere's very little to say about this book except that if you want to know anything about streams and locales, then this is the one place to find definitive answers.\n[Review]\n\n\n\n\nC++11\/14\/17\/\u2026 References:\n\nWorking Draft, Standard for Programming Language C++ generated from  LaTeX sources published on GitHub.\n\nC++ Standard Papers, latest standard working draft: ISO working draft\n\nThe C++11\/14\/17 Standard (INCITS\/ISO\/IEC 14882:2011\/2014\/2017) This, of course, is the final arbiter of all that is or isn't C++. Be aware, however, that it is intended purely as a reference for experienced users willing to devote considerable time and effort to its understanding. The C++17 standard is released in electronic form for 198 Swiss Francs.\n\nThe C++17 standard is available, but seemingly not in an economical form \u2013 directly from the ISO it costs 198 Swiss Francs (about $200 US). For most people, the final draft before standardization is more than adequate (and free). Many will prefer an even newer draft, documenting new features that are likely to be included in C++20.\n\nC++20 draft is available on GitHub as some older too.\n\nOverview of the New C++ (C++11\/14) (PDF only) (Scott Meyers) (updated for C++14) These are the presentation materials (slides and some lecture notes) of a three-day training course offered by Scott Meyers, who's a highly respected author on C++. Even though the list of items is short, the quality is high.\n\nThe C++ Core Guidelines (C++11\/14\/17\/\u2026) (edited by Bjarne Stroustrup and Herb Sutter) is an evolving online document consisting of a set of guidelines for using modern C++ well. The guidelines are focused on relatively higher-level issues, such as interfaces, resource management, memory management, and concurrency affecting application architecture and library design. The project was announced at CppCon'15 by Bjarne Stroustrup and others and welcomes contributions from the community. Most guidelines are supplemented with a rationale and examples as well as discussions of possible tool support. Many rules are designed specifically to be automatically checkable by static analysis tools.\n\nThe C++ Super-FAQ (Marshall Cline, Bjarne Stroustrup, and others) is an effort by the Standard C++ Foundation to unify the C++ FAQs previously maintained individually by Marshall Cline and Bjarne Stroustrup and also incorporating new contributions. The items mostly address issues at an intermediate level and are often written with a humorous tone. Not all items might be fully up to date with the latest edition of the C++ standard yet.\n\ncppreference.com (C++03\/11\/14\/17\/\u2026) (initiated by Nate Kohl) is a wiki that summarizes the basic core-language features and has extensive documentation of the C++ standard library. The documentation is very precise but is easier to read than the official standard document and provides better navigation due to its wiki nature. The project documents all versions of the C++ standard and the site allows filtering the display for a specific version. The project was presented by Nate Kohl at CppCon'14.\n\n\n\nClassics \/ Older\nNote: Some information contained within these books may not be up-to-date or no longer considered best practice.\n\nThe Design and Evolution of C++ (Bjarne Stroustrup)  If you want to know why the language is the way it is, this book is where you find answers. This covers everything before the standardization of C++.\n\nRuminations on C++ - (Andrew Koenig and Barbara Moo) [Review]\n\nAdvanced C++ Programming Styles and Idioms (James Coplien)  A predecessor of the pattern movement, it describes many C++-specific \u201cidioms\u201d. It's certainly a very good book and might still be worth a read if you can spare the time, but quite old and not up-to-date with current C++.\n\nLarge Scale C++ Software Design (John Lakos)  Lakos explains techniques to manage very big C++ software projects. Certainly, a good read, if it only was up to date. It was written long before C++ 98 and misses on many features (e.g. namespaces) important for large-scale projects. If you need to work on a big C++ software project, you might want to read it, although you need to take more than a grain of salt with it. Not to be confused with the extended and later book series Large Scale C++ volume I-III.\n\nInside the C++ Object Model (Stanley Lippman)  If you want to know how virtual member functions are commonly implemented and how base objects are commonly laid out in memory in a multi-inheritance scenario, and how all this affects performance, this is where you will find thorough discussions of such topics.\n\nThe Annotated C++ Reference Manual (Bjarne Stroustrup, Margaret A. Ellis) This book is quite outdated in the fact that it explores the 1989 C++ 2.0 version - Templates, exceptions, namespaces, and new casts were not yet introduced. Saying that however, this book goes through the entire C++ standard of the time explaining the rationale, the possible implementations, and features of the language. This is not a book to learn programming principles and patterns on C++, but to understand every aspect of the C++ language.\n\nThinking in C++ (Bruce Eckel, 2nd Edition, 2000).  Two volumes; is a tutorial-style free set of intro level books. Downloads: vol 1, vol 2. Unfortunately, they're marred by a number of trivial errors (e.g. maintaining that temporaries are automatic const), with no official errata list. A partial 3rd party errata list is available at http:\/\/www.computersciencelab.com\/Eckel.htm, but it is apparently not maintained.\n\nScientific and Engineering C++: An Introduction to Advanced Techniques and Examples (John Barton and Lee Nackman)\nIt is a comprehensive and very detailed book that tried to explain and make use of all the features available in C++, in the context of numerical methods. It introduced at the time several new techniques, such as the Curiously Recurring Template Pattern (CRTP, also called Barton-Nackman trick).\nIt pioneered several techniques such as dimensional analysis and automatic differentiation.\nIt came with a lot of compilable and useful code, ranging from an expression parser to a Lapack wrapper.\nThe code is still available online.\nUnfortunately, the books have become somewhat outdated in the style and C++ features, however, it was an incredible tour-de-force at the time (1994, pre-STL).\nThe chapters on dynamics inheritance are a bit complicated to understand and not very useful.\nAn updated version of this classic book that includes move semantics and the lessons learned from the STL would be very nice.\n\n\n","target":0,"question":"How do I push a new local branch to a remote Git repository and track it too?\n\nThis question attempts to collect the few pearls among the dozens of bad C++ books that are published every year.\nUnlike many other programming languages, which are often picked up on the go from tutorials found on the Internet, few are able to quickly pick up C++ without studying a well-written C++ book. It is way too big and complex for doing this. In fact, it is so big and complex, that there are very many very bad C++ books out there. And we are not talking about bad style, but things like sporting glaringly obvious factual errors and promoting abysmally bad programming styles.\nPlease edit the accepted answer to provide quality books and an approximate skill level \u2014 preferably after discussing your addition in the C++ chat room.

{"question_id":1014861,"answer":"Updated 2022 CSS Selectors 4\nIn the CSS Selectors 4 specification, CSS introduces a new selector called :has(), which finally lets us select parents. That means is we\u2019ll be able to target a CSS element that has specific children within it. This is already supported in Safari and is also in Chrome 105. The full support table is shown\nhere.\nParent Selectors workings\nIn CSS, if we want to select something, we use selectors that descend the DOM.\nFor example, selecting a p tag within a div tag looks like this:\n div p {\n   color: red;\n}\n\nUntil now, couldn\u2019t really select the div tags which had p tags within them, though, and this meant we had to resort to Javascript. The main reason this wasn\u2019t implemented in CSS is that it\u2019s quite an expensive operation to do. CSS is relatively fast to parse, but selecting parent tags requires a relatively significantly larger amount of processing.\nUsing the :has selector, we can now select div elements which have a p children, or any normal combination of selectors.\nFor example, selecting a div with a child p now looks like this:\ndiv:has(p) {\n  color: red;\n}\n\nThis will make any div with a child p red.\nCombining parent selection with other selectors\nJust like any other CSS selector, we can combine this for specific circumstances.\nFor example, if you want to select only div tags which have direct span children:\ndiv:has(> span) {\n  color: red;\n}\n\nAs the vocabulary of :has suggested, it is not just limited to parent selection.\nFor example, below we can select a span which :has a sibling div:\nspan:has(+ div) {\ncolor: red;\n}\n\nOr even, selecting an element which does not have a child, by using the :not() selector.\nFor example, the following will select any div which does not have a p child:\ndiv:not(:has(p)) {\n color: red;\n}\n\nSelecting elements that only contain text in CSS\nOne very common problem in CSS is that the :empty tag does not select elements that contain any text - so sometimes an element can contain one space, and :empty will not apply. The :has selector gives us the power to select elements that only contain text nodes and no other child elements.\nAlthough this is not the perfect solution for simply :empty elements with spaces (as this will select any element with just text and no additional HTML DOM elements) - it does give us the ability to select DOM elements with only text nodes, which was not previously possible.

{"question_id":3010840,"answer":"This answer provides an alternative to loops and array functions to iterate through an array.\nIn some cases it makes sense to use a recursive implementation over conventional loops and callbacks.

The only problem I have with it is that you have to set that magic_height parameter or equivalent.\nFixed DPI + set_size_inches\nThis approach gave a slightly wrong pixel size, and it makes it is hard to scale everything seamlessly.\nset_size_inches.py\n#!\/usr\/bin\/env python3\n\nimport sys\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib as mpl\n\nw = int(sys.argv[1])\nh = int(sys.argv[2])\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nfig.set_size_inches(w\/fig.dpi, h\/fig.dpi)\nt = np.arange(-10., 10., 1.)\nplt.plot(t, t, '.')\nplt.plot(t, t**2, '.')\nax.text(\n    0,\n    60.,\n    'Hello',\n    # Keep font size fixed independently of DPI.\n    # https:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/39395616\/matplotlib-change-figsize-but-keep-fontsize-constant\n    fontdict=dict(size=10*h\/fig.dpi),\n)\nplt.savefig(\n    'set_size_inches.png',\n    format='png',\n)\n\nRun:\n.\/set_size_inches.py 431 231\n\nOutputs:\nset_size_inches.png PNG 430x231 430x231+0+0 8-bit sRGB 8078B 0.000u 0:00.000\n\nSo the height is slightly off, and the image:\n\nThe pixel sizes are also correct if I make it 3 times larger:\n.\/set_size_inches.py 1291 693\n\nOutputs:\nset_size_inches.png PNG 1291x693 1291x693+0+0 8-bit sRGB 19798B 0.000u 0:00.000\n\n\nWe understand from this however that for this approach to scale nicely, you need to make every DPI-dependant setting proportional to the size in inches.\nIn the previous example, we only made the \"Hello\" text proportional, and it did retain its height between 60 and 80 as we'd expect. But everything for which we didn't do that, looks tiny, including:\n\nline width of axes\ntick labels\npoint markers\n\nSVG\nI could not find how to set it for SVG images, my approaches only worked for PNG, e.g.:\nget_size_svg.py\n#!\/usr\/bin\/env python3\n\nimport sys\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib as mpl\n\nheight = int(sys.argv[1])\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nt = np.arange(-10., 10., 1.)\nplt.plot(t, t, '.')\nplt.plot(t, t**2, '.')\nax.text(0., 60., 'Hello', fontdict=dict(size=25))\nplt.savefig(\n    'get_size_svg.svg',\n    format='svg',\n    dpi=height\/fig.get_size_inches()[1]\n)\n\nRun:\n.\/get_size_svg.py 431\n\nAnd the generated output contains:\n<svg height=\"345.6pt\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 460.8 345.6\" width=\"460.8pt\"\n\nAnd identify says:\nget_size_svg.svg SVG 614x461 614x461+0+0 8-bit sRGB 17094B 0.000u 0:00.000\n\nAnd if I open it in Chromium 86 the browser debug tools mouse image hover confirm that height as 460.79.\nBut of course, since SVG is a vector format, everything should in theory scale, so you can just convert to any fixed sized format without loss of resolution, e.g.:\ninkscape -h 431 get_size_svg.svg -b FFF -e get_size_svg.png\n\ngives the exact height:\n\nI use Inkscape instead of ImageMagick's convert here because you need to mess with -density as well to get sharp SVG resizes with ImageMagick:\n\nhttps:\/\/superuser.com\/questions\/598849\/imagemagick-convert-how-to-produce-sharp-resized-png-files-from-svg-files\/1602059#1602059\nHow to convert a SVG to a PNG with ImageMagick?\n\nAnd setting <img height=\"\" on the HTML should also just work for the browser.\nIt was tested on matplotlib 3.2.2.\n","target":0,"question":"How do I update or sync a forked repository on GitHub?\n\nHow do I change the size of figure drawn with Matplotlib?\n"}

{"question_id":4172722,"answer":"\n  When do I need to declare them myself?\n\n\nThe Rule of Three states that if you declare any of a \n\n\ncopy constructor\ncopy assignment operator\ndestructor\n\n\nthen you should declare all three. It grew out of the observation that the need to take over the meaning of a copy operation almost always stemmed from the class performing some kind of resource management, and that almost always implied that \n\n\nwhatever resource management was being done in one copy operation probably needed to be done in the other copy operation and \nthe class destructor would also be participating in management of the resource (usually releasing it). The classic resource to be managed was memory, and this is why all Standard Library classes that\nmanage memory (e.g., the STL containers that perform dynamic memory management) all declare \u201cthe big three\u201d: both copy operations and a destructor.\n\n\nA consequence of the Rule of Three is that the presence of a user-declared destructor indicates that simple member wise copy is unlikely to be appropriate for the copying operations in the class. That, in turn, suggests that if a class declares a destructor, the copy operations probably shouldn\u2019t be automatically generated, because they wouldn\u2019t do the right thing. At the time C++98 was adopted, the significance of this line of reasoning was not fully appreciated, so in C++98, the existence of a user declared destructor had no impact on compilers\u2019 willingness to generate copy operations. That continues to be the case in C++11, but only because restricting the conditions under which the copy operations are generated would break too much legacy code.\n\n\n  How can I prevent my objects from being copied?\n\n\nDeclare copy constructor & copy assignment operator as private access specifier.\n\nclass MemoryBlock\n{\npublic:\n\n\/\/code here\n\nprivate:\nMemoryBlock(const MemoryBlock& other)\n{\n   cout<<\"copy constructor\"<<endl;\n}\n\n\/\/ Copy assignment operator.\nMemoryBlock& operator=(const MemoryBlock& other)\n{\n return *this;\n}\n};\n\nint main()\n{\n   MemoryBlock a;\n   MemoryBlock b(a);\n}\n\n\nIn C++11 onwards you can also declare copy constructor & assignment operator deleted\n\nclass MemoryBlock\n{\npublic:\nMemoryBlock(const MemoryBlock& other) = delete\n\n\/\/ Copy assignment operator.\nMemoryBlock& operator=(const MemoryBlock& other) =delete\n};\n\n\nint main()\n{\n   MemoryBlock a;\n   MemoryBlock b(a);\n}\n\n","target":0,"question":"Avoiding NullPointerException in Java\n\n\nWhat does copying an object mean?\nWhat are the copy constructor and the copy assignment operator?\nWhen do I need to declare them myself?\nHow can I prevent my objects from being copied?\n\n"}

{"question_id":3279543,"answer":"I would like to add a word of warning when you are dealing with C++11-style allocator-aware containers. Swapping and assignment have subtly different semantics.\n\nFor concreteness, let us consider a container std::vector<T, A>, where A is some stateful allocator type, and we'll compare the following functions:\n\nvoid fs(std::vector<T, A> & a, std::vector<T, A> & b)\n{ \n    a.swap(b);\n    b.clear(); \/\/ not important what you do with b\n}\n\nvoid fm(std::vector<T, A> & a, std::vector<T, A> & b)\n{\n    a = std::move(b);\n}\n\n\nThe purpose of both functions fs and fm is to give a the state that b had initially. However, there is a hidden question: What happens if a.get_allocator() != b.get_allocator()? The answer is: It depends. Let's write AT = std::allocator_traits<A>.\n\n\nIf AT::propagate_on_container_move_assignment is std::true_type, then fm reassigns the allocator of a with the value of b.get_allocator(), otherwise it does not, and a continues to use its original allocator. In that case, the data elements need to be swapped individually, since the storage of a and b is not compatible.\nIf AT::propagate_on_container_swap is std::true_type, then fs swaps both data and allocators in the expected fashion.\nIf AT::propagate_on_container_swap is std::false_type, then we need a dynamic check.\n\n\nIf a.get_allocator() == b.get_allocator(), then the two containers use compatible storage, and swapping proceeds in the usual fashion.\nHowever, if a.get_allocator() != b.get_allocator(), the program has undefined behaviour (cf. [container.requirements.general\/8].\n\n\n\nThe upshot is that swapping has become a non-trivial operation in C++11 as soon as your container starts supporting stateful allocators. That's a somewhat \"advanced use case\", but it's not entirely unlikely, since move optimizations usually only become interesting once your class manages a resource, and memory is one of the most popular resources.\n","target":0,"question":"How do I remove a submodule?\n\nWhat is the copy-and-swap idiom and when should it be used?

It is based on libxml.\n\nXML Reader: XMLReader, like DOM, is based on libxml. The XMLReader extension is an XML pull parser. The reader acts as a cursor going forward on the document stream and stopping at each node on the way\n\nXML Parser: This extension lets you create XML parsers and then define handlers for different XML events. Each XML parser also has a few parameters you can adjust. It implements a SAX style XML push parser.\n\nSimple XML: The SimpleXML extension provides a very simple and easily usable toolset to convert XML to an object that can be processed with normal property selectors and array iterators.\n\n\n3rd Party Libraries [ libxml based ]:\n\nFluentDom - Repo: FluentDOM provides a jQuery-like fluent XML interface for the DOMDocument in PHP. It can load formats like JSON, CSV, JsonML, RabbitFish and others. Can be installed via Composer.\n\nHtmlPageDom: is a PHP library for easy manipulation of HTML documents using It requires DomCrawler from Symfony2 components for traversing the DOM tree and extends it by adding methods for manipulating the DOM tree of HTML documents.\n\nZendDOM: Zend_Dom provides tools for working with DOM documents and structures. Currently, they offer Zend_Dom_Query, which provides a unified interface for querying DOM documents utilizing both XPath and CSS selectors.\n\nQueryPath: QueryPath is a PHP library for manipulating XML and HTML. It is designed to work not only with local files but also with web services and database resources. It implements much of the jQuery interface (including CSS-style selectors), but it is heavily tuned for server-side use. Can be installed via Composer.\n\nfDOM Document: fDOMDocument extends the standard DOM to use exceptions at all occasions of errors instead of PHP warnings or notices. They also add various custom methods and shortcuts for convenience and to simplify the usage of DOM.\n\nSabre\/XML: sabre\/xml is a library that wraps and extends the XMLReader and XMLWriter classes to create a simple \"xml to object\/array\" mapping system and design pattern. Writing and reading XML is single-pass and can therefore be fast and require low memory on large xml files.\n\nFluidXML: FluidXML is a PHP library for manipulating XML with a concise and fluent API.

{"question_id":10057671,"answer":"PHP foreach loop can be used with Indexed arrays, Associative arrays and Object public variables.\n\nIn foreach loop, the first thing php does is that it creates a copy of the array which is to be iterated over. PHP then iterates over this new copy of the array rather than the original one. This is demonstrated in the below example:\n\n<?php\n$numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]; # initial values for our array\necho '<pre>', print_r($numbers, true), '<\/pre>', '<hr \/>';\nforeach($numbers as $index => $number){\n    $numbers[$index] = $number + 1; # this is making changes to the origial array\n    echo 'Inside of the array = ', $index, ': ', $number, '<br \/>'; # showing data from the copied array\n}\necho '<hr \/>', '<pre>', print_r($numbers, true), '<\/pre>'; # shows the original values (also includes the newly added values).\n\n\nBesides this, php does allow to use iterated values as a reference to the original array value as well. This is demonstrated below:\n\n<?php\n$numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9];\necho '<pre>', print_r($numbers, true), '<\/pre>';\nforeach($numbers as $index => &$number){\n    ++$number; # we are incrementing the original value\n    echo 'Inside of the array = ', $index, ': ', $number, '<br \/>'; # this is showing the original value\n}\necho '<hr \/>';\necho '<pre>', print_r($numbers, true), '<\/pre>'; # we are again showing the original value\n\n\nNote: It does not allow original array indexes to be used as references.\n\nSource: http:\/\/dwellupper.io\/post\/47\/understanding-php-foreach-loop-with-examples\n","target":0,"question":"How do I check if a directory exists in a Bash shell script?\n\nLet me prefix this by saying that I know what foreach is, does and how to use it. This question concerns how it works under the bonnet, and I don't want any answers along the lines of \"this is how you loop an array with foreach\".\n\n\n\nFor a long time I assumed that foreach worked with the array itself. Then I found many references to the fact that it works with a copy of the array, and I have since assumed this to be the end of the story. But I recently got into a discussion on the matter, and after a little experimentation found that this was not in fact 100% true.\n\nLet me show what I mean. For the following test cases, we will be working with the following array:\n\n$array = array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);\n\n\nTest case 1:\n\nforeach ($array as $item) {\n  echo \"$item\\n\";\n  $array[] = $item;\n}\nprint_r($array);\n\n\/* Output in loop:    1 2 3 4 5\n   $array after loop: 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 *\/\n\n\nThis clearly shows that we are not working directly with the source array - otherwise the loop would continue forever, since we are constantly pushing items onto the array during the loop. But just to be sure this is the case:\n\nTest case 2:\n\nforeach ($array as $key => $item) {\n  $array[$key + 1] = $item + 2;\n  echo \"$item\\n\";\n}\n\nprint_r($array);\n\n\/* Output in loop:    1 2 3 4 5\n   $array after loop: 1 3 4 5 6 7 *\/\n\n\nThis backs up our initial conclusion, we are working with a copy of the source array during the loop, otherwise we would see the modified values during the loop. But...\n\nIf we look in the manual, we find this statement:\n\n\n  When foreach first starts executing, the internal array pointer is automatically reset to the first element of the array.\n\n\nRight... this seems to suggest that foreach relies on the array pointer of the source array. But we've just proved that we're not working with the source array, right? Well, not entirely.\n\nTest case 3:\n\n\/\/ Move the array pointer on one to make sure it doesn't affect the loop\nvar_dump(each($array));\n\nforeach ($array as $item) {\n  echo \"$item\\n\";\n}\n\nvar_dump(each($array));\n\n\/* Output\n  array(4) {\n    [1]=>\n    int(1)\n    [\"value\"]=>\n    int(1)\n    [0]=>\n    int(0)\n    [\"key\"]=>\n    int(0)\n  }\n  1\n  2\n  3\n  4\n  5\n  bool(false)\n*\/\n\n\nSo, despite the fact that we are not working directly with the source array, we are working directly with the source array pointer - the fact that the pointer is at the end of the array at the end of the loop shows this. Except this can't be true - if it was, then test case 1 would loop forever.\n\nThe PHP manual also states:\n\n\n  As foreach relies on the internal array pointer changing it within the loop may lead to unexpected behavior.\n\n\nWell, let's find out what that \"unexpected behavior\" is (technically, any behavior is unexpected since I no longer know what to expect).\n\nTest case 4:\n\nforeach ($array as $key => $item) {\n  echo \"$item\\n\";\n  each($array);\n}\n\n\/* Output: 1 2 3 4 5 *\/\n\n\nTest case 5:\n\nforeach ($array as $key => $item) {\n  echo \"$item\\n\";\n  reset($array);\n}\n\n\/* Output: 1 2 3 4 5 *\/\n\n\n...nothing that unexpected there, in fact it seems to support the \"copy of source\" theory.\n\n\n\nThe Question\n\nWhat is going on here? My C-fu is not good enough for me to able to extract a proper conclusion simply by looking at the PHP source code, I would appreciate it if someone could translate it into English for me.\n\nIt seems to me that foreach works with a copy of the array, but sets the array pointer of the source array to the end of the array after the loop.\n\n\nIs this correct and the whole story?\nIf not, what is it really doing?\nIs there any situation where using functions that adjust the array pointer (each(), reset() et al.) during a foreach could affect the outcome of the loop?\n\n"}

{"question_id":538060,"answer":"I see a lot of answers have shifted to talk about using IDisposable for both managed and unmanaged resources.  I'd suggest this article as one of the best explanations that I've found for how IDisposable should actually be used.\nhttps:\/\/www.codeproject.com\/Articles\/29534\/IDisposable-What-Your-Mother-Never-Told-You-About\nFor the actual question; should you use IDisposable to clean up managed objects that are taking up a lot of memory the short answer would be no.  The reason is that once your object that is holding the memory goes out of scope it is ready for collection.  At that point any referenced child objects are also out of scope and will get collected.\nThe only real exception to this would be if you have a lot of memory tied up in managed objects and you've blocked that thread waiting for some operation to complete.  If those objects where not going to be needed after that call completed then setting those references to null might allow the garbage collector to collect them sooner.  But that scenario would represent bad code that needed to be refactored - not a use case of IDisposable.\n","target":0,"question":"Sort array of objects by string property value\n\nI know from reading Microsoft documentation that the \"primary\" use of the IDisposable interface is to clean up unmanaged resources.\nTo me, \"unmanaged\" means things like database connections, sockets, window handles, etc.  But, I've seen code where the Dispose() method is implemented to free managed resources, which seems redundant to me, since the garbage collector should take care of that for you.\nFor example:\npublic class MyCollection : IDisposable\n{\n    private List<String> _theList = new List<String>();\n    private Dictionary<String, Point> _theDict = new Dictionary<String, Point>();\n\n    \/\/ Die, clear it up!

But suppose that _theList in the above code contained a million strings, and you wanted to free that memory now, rather than waiting for the garbage collector.

{"question_id":518000,"answer":"Everything is passed by value.\nBasic types are passed by value (i.e. a new copy of the actual variable value is passed to the function).\nComplex types (objects) are passed as \"pointer to the object\". So the actual stuff you are passing is a pointer which is passed by value (it's an address, a numerical value like any other). Obviously if you try to modify a property of the object inside the function, the modification will be reflected even outside of such function. That's because you are accessing the property via the pointer which points to the unique copy of the property.\nThe confusion here has arises over \"passing a pointer by value\" and \"passing an object by reference\".\n","target":0,"question":"How do I clone a specific Git branch?\n\nThe primitive types (number, string, etc.) are passed by value, but objects are unknown, because they can be both passed-by-value (in case we consider that a variable holding an object is in fact a reference to the object) and passed-by-reference (when we consider that the variable to the object holds the object itself).\n\nAlthough it doesn't really matter at the end, I want to know what is the correct way to present the arguments passing conventions.

{"question_id":44965,"answer":"For people coming from the imperative background (c# specifically),\nconsider the following code\nbool ReturnTrueorFalse(SomeObject input)\n{\n    if(input.Property1 is invalid)\n    {\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    if(input.Property2 is invalid)\n    {\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    DoSomething();\n    return true;\n}\n\nYou would have seen lots of code like this, you would have even seen no early returns but all the checks are done nested. Now, Monad is a pattern where this can be flattened like below\nMonad<bool> ReturnTrueorFalse(SomeObject input) =>\n    from isProperty1Valid in input.Property1\n    from isProperty2Valid in input.Property2\n    select Monad.Create(isProperty1Valid && isProperty2Valid);\n\nThere are a few things to note here. First, the function's return value is changed. Second, both the properties of input have to be Monad. Next, Monad should implement SelectMany(LINQ's flattening operator). Since SelectMany is implemented for that type, the statements can be written using the query syntax\nSo, what is a Monad? It is a structure that flattens expressions that return the same type in a composable way. This is particularly useful in functional programming because most functional applications tend to keep the state and IO at the edge layer of the application (eg: Controllers) and return Monad based return values throughout the call stack until the value is required to be unwrapped. The biggest plus for me when I first saw this was it was so easy on the eyes as it was so declarative.\nThe best example of a Monad that every c# (these days almost everyone) developer can immediately recognize is async\/await. Before.Net4.5 we had to write Task-based statements using ContinueWith for handling callbacks, after async\/await we started using synchronous syntax for asynchronous syntax. This is possible because Task is a \"monad\".\nRefer to this for a detailed explanation, this for simple implementation and language-ext for lots of awesome Monads and tons of information about functional programming in general for an OOP developer\n","target":0,"question":"How do I cast int to enum in C#?\n\nHaving briefly looked at Haskell recently, what would be a brief, succinct, practical explanation as to what a monad essentially is?\n\nI have found most explanations I've come across to be fairly inaccessible and lacking in practical detail.\n"}

Afterwards, we iterate over the buffer and use an unrolled version of the x86 popcount intrinsic to perform the popcount. To get a more precise result, we do the popcount 10,000 times. We measure the times for the popcount. In the upper case, the inner loop variable is unsigned, in the lower case, the inner loop variable is uint64_t. I thought that this should make no difference, but the opposite is the case.\n\nThe (absolutely crazy) results\n\nI compile it like this (g++ version: Ubuntu 4.8.2-19ubuntu1):\n\ng++ -O3 -march=native -std=c++11 test.cpp -o test\n\n\nHere are the results on my Haswell Core i7-4770K CPU @ 3.50\u00a0GHz, running test 1 (so 1\u00a0MB random data):\n\n\nunsigned  41959360000  0.401554 sec   26.113\u00a0GB\/s\nuint64_t  41959360000  0.759822 sec   13.8003\u00a0GB\/s\n\n\nAs you see, the throughput of the uint64_t version is only half the one of the unsigned version! The problem seems to be that different assembly gets generated, but why? First, I thought of a compiler bug, so I tried clang++ (Ubuntu Clang version 3.4-1ubuntu3):\n\nclang++ -O3 -march=native -std=c++11 teest.cpp -o test\n\n\nResult: test 1\n\n\nunsigned  41959360000  0.398293 sec   26.3267 GB\/s\nuint64_t  41959360000  0.680954 sec   15.3986 GB\/s\n\n\nSo, it is almost the same result and is still strange. But now it gets super strange. I replace the buffer size that was read from input with a constant 1, so I change:\n\nuint64_t size = atol(argv[1]) << 20;\n\n\nto\n\nuint64_t size = 1 << 20;\n\n\nThus, the compiler now knows the buffer size at compile time. Maybe it can add some optimizations! Here are the numbers for g++:\n\n\nunsigned  41959360000  0.509156 sec   20.5944\u00a0GB\/s\nuint64_t  41959360000  0.508673 sec   20.6139\u00a0GB\/s\n\n\nNow, both versions are equally fast. However, the unsigned got even slower! It dropped from 26 to 20 GB\/s, thus replacing a non-constant by a constant value lead to a deoptimization. Seriously, I have no clue what is going on here! But now to clang++ with the new version:\n\n\nunsigned  41959360000  0.677009 sec   15.4884\u00a0GB\/s\nuint64_t  41959360000  0.676909 sec   15.4906\u00a0GB\/s\n\n\nWait, what? Now, both versions dropped to the slow number of 15\u00a0GB\/s. Thus, replacing a non-constant by a constant value even lead to slow code in both cases for Clang!\n\nI asked a colleague with an Ivy Bridge CPU to compile my benchmark. He got similar results, so it does not seem to be Haswell. Because two compilers produce strange results here, it also does not seem to be a compiler bug. We do not have an AMD CPU here, so we could only test with Intel.\n\nMore madness, please!\n\nTake the first example (the one with atol(argv[1])) and put a static before the variable, i.e.:\n\nstatic uint64_t size=atol(argv[1])<<20;\n\n\nHere are my results in g++:\n\n\nunsigned  41959360000  0.396728 sec   26.4306 GB\/s\nuint64_t  41959360000  0.509484 sec   20.5811 GB\/s\n\n\nYay, yet another alternative. We still have the fast 26\u00a0GB\/s with u32, but we managed to get u64 at least from the 13\u00a0GB\/s to the 20\u00a0GB\/s version! On my collegue's PC, the u64 version became even faster than the u32 version, yielding the fastest result of all. Sadly, this only works for g++, clang++ does not seem to care about static.\n\nMy question\n\nCan you explain these results? Especially:\n\n\nHow can there be such a difference between u32 and u64?\nHow can replacing a non-constant by a constant buffer size trigger less optimal code?\nHow can the insertion of the static keyword make the u64 loop faster? Even faster than the original code on my collegue's computer!\n\n\nI know that optimization is a tricky territory, however, I never thought that such small changes can lead to a 100% difference in execution time and that small factors like a constant buffer size can again mix results totally. Of course, I always want to have the version that is able to popcount 26\u00a0GB\/s. The only reliable way I can think of is copy paste the assembly for this case and use inline assembly. This is the only way I can get rid of compilers that seem to go mad on small changes. What do you think? Is there another way to reliably get the code with most performance?\n\nThe Disassembly\n\nHere is the disassembly for the various results:\n\n26\u00a0GB\/s version from g++ \/ u32 \/ non-const bufsize:\n\n0x400af8:\nlea 0x1(%rdx),%eax\npopcnt (%rbx,%rax,8),%r9\nlea 0x2(%rdx),%edi\npopcnt (%rbx,%rcx,8),%rax\nlea 0x3(%rdx),%esi\nadd %r9,%rax\npopcnt (%rbx,%rdi,8),%rcx\nadd $0x4,%edx\nadd %rcx,%rax\npopcnt (%rbx,%rsi,8),%rcx\nadd %rcx,%rax\nmov %edx,%ecx\nadd %rax,%r14\ncmp %rbp,%rcx\njb 0x400af8\n\n\n13\u00a0GB\/s version from g++ \/ u64 \/ non-const bufsize:\n\n0x400c00:\npopcnt 0x8(%rbx,%rdx,8),%rcx\npopcnt (%rbx,%rdx,8),%rax\nadd %rcx,%rax\npopcnt 0x10(%rbx,%rdx,8),%rcx\nadd %rcx,%rax\npopcnt 0x18(%rbx,%rdx,8),%rcx\nadd $0x4,%rdx\nadd %rcx,%rax\nadd %rax,%r12\ncmp %rbp,%rdx\njb 0x400c00\n\n\n15\u00a0GB\/s version from clang++ \/ u64 \/ non-const bufsize:\n\n0x400e50:\npopcnt (%r15,%rcx,8),%rdx\nadd %rbx,%rdx\npopcnt 0x8(%r15,%rcx,8),%rsi\nadd %rdx,%rsi\npopcnt 0x10(%r15,%rcx,8),%rdx\nadd %rsi,%rdx\npopcnt 0x18(%r15,%rcx,8),%rbx\nadd %rdx,%rbx\nadd $0x4,%rcx\ncmp %rbp,%rcx\njb 0x400e50\n\n\n20\u00a0GB\/s version from g++ \/ u32&u64 \/ const bufsize:\n\n0x400a68:\npopcnt (%rbx,%rdx,1),%rax\npopcnt 0x8(%rbx,%rdx,1),%rcx\nadd %rax,%rcx\npopcnt 0x10(%rbx,%rdx,1),%rax\nadd %rax,%rcx\npopcnt 0x18(%rbx,%rdx,1),%rsi\nadd $0x20,%rdx\nadd %rsi,%rcx\nadd %rcx,%rbp\ncmp $0x100000,%rdx\njne 0x400a68\n\n\n15\u00a0GB\/s version from clang++ \/ u32&u64 \/ const bufsize:\n\n0x400dd0:\npopcnt (%r14,%rcx,8),%rdx\nadd %rbx,%rdx\npopcnt 0x8(%r14,%rcx,8),%rsi\nadd %rdx,%rsi\npopcnt 0x10(%r14,%rcx,8),%rdx\nadd %rsi,%rdx\npopcnt 0x18(%r14,%rcx,8),%rbx\nadd %rdx,%rbx\nadd $0x4,%rcx\ncmp $0x20000,%rcx\njb 0x400dd0\n\n\nInterestingly, the fastest (26\u00a0GB\/s) version is also the longest! It seems to be the only solution that uses lea. Some versions use jb to jump, others use jne. But apart from that, all versions seem to be comparable. I don't see where a 100% performance gap could originate from, but I am not too adept at deciphering assembly. The slowest (13\u00a0GB\/s) version looks even very short and good. Can anyone explain this?\n\nLessons learned\n\nNo matter what the answer to this question will be; I have learned that in really hot loops every detail can matter, even details that do not seem to have any association to the hot code. I have never thought about what type to use for a loop variable, but as you see such a minor change can make a 100% difference! Even the storage type of a buffer can make a huge difference, as we saw with the insertion of the static keyword in front of the size variable! In the future, I will always test various alternatives on various compilers when writing really tight and hot loops that are crucial for system performance.\n\nThe interesting thing is also that the performance difference is still so high although I have already unrolled the loop four times. So even if you unroll, you can still get hit by major performance deviations. Quite interesting.\n"}
{"question_id":3601602,"answer":"This is Venn diagram I made for a highly visual C++ book I'm writing which I will be publishing on leanpub during development soon.\n\nThe other answers go into more detail with words, and show similar diagrams. But hopefully this presentation of the information is fairly complete and useful for referencing, in addition.\nThe main takeaway for me on this topic is that expressions have these two properties: identity and movability. The first deals with the the \"solidness\" with which something exists. That's important because the C++ abstract machine is allowed to and encouraged to aggressively change and shrink your code through optimizations, and that means that things without identity might only ever exist in the mind of the compiler or in a register for a brief moment before getting trampled on. But a piece of data like that is also guaranteed not to cause issues if you recycle it's innards since there's no way to try to use it. And thus, move semantics were invented to allow us to capture references to temporaries, upgrading them to lvalues and extending their lifetime.\nMove semantics originally were about not just throwing away temporaries wastefully, but instead giving them away so they can consumed by another.\n\nWhen you give your cornbread away, the person you give it to now owns it. They consume it. You should not attempt to eat or digest said cornbread once you've given it away. Maybe that cornbread was headed for the trash anyway, but now it's headed for their bellies. It's not yours anymore.\nIn C++ land, the idea of \"consuming\" a resource means that resource is now owned by us and so we should do any cleanup necessary, and ensure the object isn't accessed elsewhere. Often times, that means borrowing the guts to create new objects. I call that \"donating organs\". Usually, we are talking about pointers or references contained by the object, or something like that, and we want to keep those pointers or references around because they refer to data elsewhere in our program that is not dying.\nThus you could write a function overload that takes an rvalue reference, and if a temporary (prvalue) were passed in, that's the overload that would be called. A new lvalue would be created upon binding to the rvalue reference taken by the function, extending the life of the temporary so you could consume it within your function.\nAt some point, we realized that we often had lvalue non-temporary data that we were finished with in one scope, but wanted to cannibalize in another scope. But they aren't rvalues and so wouldn't bind to an rvalue reference. So we made std::move, which is just a fancy cast from lvalue to rvalue reference. Such a datum is an xvalue: a former lvalue now acting as if it were a temporary so it can also be moved from.\n","target":0,"question":"How do I get the current branch name in Git?\n\nIn C++03, an expression is either an rvalue or an lvalue.\n\nIn C++11, an expression can be an:     \n\n\nrvalue\nlvalue\nxvalue\nglvalue\nprvalue\n\n\nTwo categories have become five categories.\n\n\nWhat are these new categories of expressions?\nHow do these new categories relate to the existing rvalue and lvalue categories?  \nAre the rvalue and lvalue categories in C++0x the same as they are in C++03?\nWhy are these new categories needed?

So no one else will ever have to maintain this code.  And this kind of micro-optimization could actually make a difference, since part of the challenge is to do every algorithm in less than a minute, and this function will need to be called millions of times in some problems.\n\n\n\nI've tried the different solutions to the problem:\n\n\nAfter exhaustive testing, I found that adding 0.5 to the result of Math.sqrt() is not necessary, at least not on my machine.\nThe fast inverse square root was faster, but it gave incorrect results for n >= 410881.  However, as suggested by BobbyShaftoe, we can use the FISR hack for n < 410881.\nNewton's method was a good bit slower than Math.sqrt().  This is probably because Math.sqrt() uses something similar to Newton's Method, but implemented in the hardware so it's much faster than in Java.  Also, Newton's Method still required use of doubles.\nA modified Newton's method, which used a few tricks so that only integer math was involved, required some hacks to avoid overflow (I want this function to work with all positive 64-bit signed integers), and it was still slower than Math.sqrt().\nBinary chop was even slower.  This makes sense because the binary chop will on average require 16 passes to find the square root of a 64-bit number.\nAccording to John's tests, using or statements is faster in C++ than using a switch, but in Java and C# there appears to be no difference between or and switch.\nI also tried making a lookup table (as a private static array of 64 boolean values).  Then instead of either switch or or statement, I would just say if(lookup[(int)(n&0x3F)]) { test } else return false;.  To my surprise, this was (just slightly) slower.

{"question_id":521298,"answer":"\nClasses are best suited for grouping together complex actions and data\nthat will change throughout a program; structs are a better choice for\nsimple objects and data that will remain constant for the most part.\nBesides their uses, they are fundamentally different in one key\narea\u2014that is, how they are passed or assigned between variables.\nClasses are reference types, meaning that they are passed by\nreference; structs are value types, meaning that they are passed by\nvalue.\n\n\nbe careful using class. If you have some game objects that refer to the same memory, modifying one will modify the others.\n\n\nWhen a struct object is created, all of its data is stored in its\ncorresponding variable with no references or connections to its memory\nlocation. This makes structs useful for creating objects that need to\nbe copied quickly and efficiently, while still retaining their\nseparate identities.\n\nExampleStruct struct1= new ExampleStruct()\nExampleStruct struct2= struct1\n\nmodifying struct2 wont affect struct1.\n\nBasically, structs are created to increase performance. But, sometimes structs may be slower because of all the copying involved. If your struct has lots of variables that need to be copied converting it to a class and just passing references around may be faster\n\nIf you have an array of structs, the array itself is an object on the heap and struct values are contained in the array. So garbage collector only has one object to consider. If the array goes out of the scope, the garbage collector can deallocate all the structs inside the array in one step. If any other part of your code is using structs from this array, since structs are copied we can safely deallocate the array itself and its contents.\n\nIf you have an array of objects, the array itself and each object in the array are separe objects on the heap. Each object could be stored in a totally different part of the heap and another part of your code might have references to those objects. So when our array goes out of scope, we cannot deallocate the array right away. Because the garbage collector has to consider each object individually and make sure there are no references to each object before de-allocating them.\n\n\n","target":0,"question":"How do I get the current time?\n\nWhen should you use struct and not class in C#?

{"question_id":1028649,"answer":"A duplicate annotated tag \u2014 including all tag info such as tagger, message, and tag date \u2014 can be created by using the tag info from the existing tag.\nSOURCE_TAG=old NEW_TAG=new; deref() { git for-each-ref \\\n\"refs\/tags\/$SOURCE_TAG\" --format=\"%($1)\" ; }; \\\nGIT_COMMITTER_NAME=\"$(deref taggername)\" \\\nGIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL=\"$(deref taggeremail)\" \\\nGIT_COMMITTER_DATE=\"$(deref taggerdate)\" git tag \"$NEW_TAG\" \\\n\"$(deref \"*objectname\")\" -a -m \"$(deref contents)\"\n\ngit tag -d old\n\ngit push origin new :old\n\nUpdate the SOURCE_TAG and NEW_TAG values to match your old and new tag names.\nThis command only addresses unsigned tags, though it should be a simple matter to extend this solution to signed tags.\nGoal\nTo truly be an indistinguishable rename, all elements of an annotated tag should be the same in the new tag.  The git-tag documentation specifies the parts of an annotated tag.\n\nTag objects (created with -a, -s, or -u) are called \"annotated\" tags; they contain a creation date, the tagger name and e-mail, a tagging message, and an optional GnuPG signature.\n\nAnswer motivation\nFrom what I can tell, all the other answers have subtle gotchas, or don't fully duplicate everything about the tag (e.g. they use a new tag date, or the current user's info as the tagger).  Many of them  call out the re-tagging warning, despite that not applying to this scenario (it's for moving a tag name to a different commit, not for renaming to a differently named tag).  I've done some digging, and have pieced together a solution that I believe addresses these concerns.\nProcedure\nAn annotated tag named old is used in the example, and will be renamed to new.\nStep 1: Get existing tag information\nFirst, we need to get the information for the existing tag.  This can be achieved using for-each-ref:\nCommand:\ngit for-each-ref refs\/tags --format=\"\\\nTag name: %(refname:short)\nTag commit: %(objectname:short)\nTagger date: %(taggerdate)\nTagger name: %(taggername)\nTagger email: %(taggeremail)\nTagged commit: %(*objectname:short)\nTag message: %(contents)\"\n\nOutput:\nTag commit: 88a6169\nTagger date: Mon Dec 14 12:44:52 2020 -0600\nTagger name: John Doe\nTagger email: <j.doe@example.com>\nTagged commit: cda5b4d\nTag name: old\nTag message: Initial tag\n\nBody line 1.\nBody line 2.\nBody line 3.\n\nStep 2: Create a duplicate tag locally\nA duplicate tag with the new name can be created using the info gathered in step 1 from the existing tag.\nThe commit ID & commit message can be passed directly to git tag.\nThe tagger information (name, email, and date) can be set using the git environment variables GIT_COMMITTER_NAME, GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL, GIT_COMMITTER_DATE.  The date usage in this context is described in the On Backdating Tags documentation for git tag; the other two I figured out through experimentation.\nGIT_COMMITTER_NAME=\"John Doe\" GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL=\"j.doe@example.com\" \\\nGIT_COMMITTER_DATE=\"Mon Dec 14 12:44:52 2020 -0600\" git tag new cda5b4d -a -m \"Initial tag\n\nBody line 1.\nBody line 2.\nBody line 3.\"\n\nA side-by-side comparison of the two tags shows they're identical in all the ways that matter.  The only thing that's differing here is the commit reference of the tag itself, which is expected since they're two different tags.\nCommand:\ngit for-each-ref refs\/tags --format=\"\\\nTag commit: %(objectname:short)\nTagger date: %(taggerdate)\nTagger name: %(taggername)\nTagger email: %(taggeremail)\nTagged commit: %(*objectname:short)\nTag name: %(refname:short)\nTag message: %(contents)\"\n\nOutput:\nTag commit: 580f817\nTagger date: Mon Dec 14 12:44:52 2020 -0600\nTagger name: John Doe\nTagger email: <j.doe@example.com>\nTagged commit: cda5b4d\nTag name: new\nTag message: Initial tag\n\nBody line 1.\nBody line 2.\nBody line 3.\n\nTag commit: 30ddd25\nTagger date: Mon Dec 14 12:44:52 2020 -0600\nTagger name: John Doe\nTagger email: <j.doe@example.com>\nTagged commit: cda5b4d\nTag name: old\nTag message: Initial tag\n\nBody line 1.\nBody line 2.\nBody line 3.\n\nAs a single command, including retrieving the current tag data:\nSOURCE_TAG=old NEW_TAG=new; deref() { git for-each-ref \"refs\/tags\/$SOURCE_TAG\" --format=\"%($1)\" ; }; GIT_COMMITTER_NAME=\"$(deref taggername)\" GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL=\"$(deref taggeremail)\" GIT_COMMITTER_DATE=\"$(deref taggerdate)\" git tag \"$NEW_TAG\" \"$(deref \"*objectname\")\" -a -m \"$(deref contents)\"\n\nStep 3: Delete the existing tag locally\nNext, the existing tag should be deleted locally.  This step can be skipped if you wish to keep the old tag along with the new one (i.e. duplicate the tag rather than rename it).\ngit tag -d old\n\nStep 4: Push changes to remote repository\nAssuming you're working from a remote repository, the changes can now be pushed using git push:\ngit push origin new :old\n\nThis pushes the new tag, and deletes the old tag.\n","target":0,"question":"What is the difference between __str__ and __repr__?\n\nToday I was looking through the logs for a project and realized that I fat fingered a tag name some time ago. Is there some way to rename the tag? Google hasn't turned up anything useful.\n\nI realize I could check out the tagged version and make a new tag, I even tried that. But that seems to create a tag object that isn't quite right. For one,\n\ngit tag -l\n\n\nlists it out of order relative to all of the other tags. I have no idea if that's significant, but it leads me to believe that the new tag object isn't quite what I want. I can live with that, because I really only care that the tag name matches the documentation, but I'd rather do it \"right\", assuming there is a right way to do this.\n"}

{"question_id":273695,"answer":"Note, as illustrated in the commit e703d7 or commit b6c2a0d  (March 2014), now part of Git 2.0, you will find another naming convention (that you can apply to branches).\n\n\n  \"When you need to use space, use dash\" is a strange way to say that you must not use a space.\n  Because it is more common for the command line descriptions to use dashed-multi-words, you do not even want to use spaces in these places.  \n\n\nA branch name cannot have space (see \"Which characters are illegal within a branch name?\" and git check-ref-format man page).\n\nSo for every branch name that would be represented by a multi-word expression, using a '-' (dash) as a separator is a good idea.\n","target":0,"question":"403 Forbidden vs 401 Unauthorized HTTP responses\n\nI've been using a local git repository interacting with my group's CVS repository for several months, now.  I've made an almost neurotic number of branches, most of which have thankfully merged back into my trunk.  But naming is starting to become an issue.  If I have a task easily named with a simple label, but I accomplish it in three stages which each include their own branch and merge situation, then I can repeat the branch name each time, but that makes the history a little confusing.  If I get more specific in the names, with a separate description for each stage, then the branch names start to get long and unwieldy.\n\nI did learn looking through old threads here that I could start naming branches with a \/ in the name, i.e., topic\/task, or something like that.  I may start doing that and seeing if it helps keep things better organized.\n\nWhat are some best practices for naming git branches?\n\nEdit:\nNobody has actually suggested any naming conventions.\nI do delete branches when I'm done with them.  I just happen to have several around due to management constantly adjusting my priorities. :)\nAs an example of why I might need more than one branch on a task, suppose I need to commit the first discrete milestone in the task to the group's CVS repository.  At that point, due to my imperfect interaction with CVS, I would perform that commit and then kill that branch.  (I've seen too much weirdness interacting with CVS if I try to continue to use the same branch at that point.)\n"}
{"question_id":4871051,"answer":"This is a very confuse topic, and we need to understand some concepts before providing a real solution.\n\nThe File, and NIO File Api approaches with relative paths \"\" or \".\" uses internally the system parameter \"user.dir\" value to determine the return location.\n\nThe \"user.dir\" value is based on the USER working directory, and the behavior of that value depends on the operative system, and the way the jar is executed.\n\nFor example, executing a JAR from Linux using a File Explorer (opening it by double click) will set user.dir with the user home directory, regardless of the location of the jar. If the same jar is executed from command line, it will return the jar location, because each cd command to the jar location modified the working directory.\n\n\nHaving said that, the solutions using Java NIO, Files or \"user.dir\" property will work for all the scenarios in the way the \"user.dir\" has the correct value.\nString userDirectory = System.getProperty(\"user.dir\");\nString userDirectory2 = new File(\"\").getAbsolutePath();\nString userDirectory3 = Paths.get(\"\").toAbsolutePath().toString();\n\nWe could use the following code:\nnew File(MyApp.class.getProtectionDomain()\n                     .getCodeSource()\n                     .getLocation()\n                     .toURI().getPath())\n     .getParent();\n\nto get the current location of the executed JAR, and personally I used the following approach to get the expected location and overriding the \"user.dir\" system property at the very beginning of the application. So, later when the other approaches are used, I will get the expected values always.\nMore details here -> https:\/\/blog.adamgamboa.dev\/getting-current-directory-path-in-java\/\n    public class MyApp {\n      \n      static {\n        \/\/This static block runs at the very begin of the APP, even before the main method.\n        try{\n          File file = new File(MyApp.class.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource()\n                           .getLocation().toURI().getPath());\n          String basePath = file.getParent();\n          \/\/Overrides the existing value of \"user.dir\"\n          System.getProperties().put(\"user.dir\", basePath);\n        }catch(URISyntaxException ex){\n          \/\/log the error\n        }\n      }\n     \n      public static void main(String args []){\n        \/\/Your app logic\n        \n        \/\/All these approaches should return the expected value\n        \/\/regardless of the way the jar is executed.\n        String userDirectory = System.getProperty(\"user.dir\");\n        String userDirectory2 = new File(\"\").getAbsolutePath();\n        String userDirectory3 = Paths.get(\"\").toAbsolutePath().toString();\n      }\n    }\n\nI hope this explanation and details are helpful to others...\n","target":0,"question":"How do I convert a String to an int in Java?\n\nI want to access my current working directory using Java.\nMy code:\n String currentPath = new java.io.File(\".\").getCanonicalPath();\n System.out.println(\"Current dir:\" + currentPath);\n\n String currentDir = System.getProperty(\"user.dir\");\n System.out.println(\"Current dir using System:\" + currentDir);\n\nOutput:\nCurrent dir: C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\nCurrent dir using System: C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\n\nMy output is not correct because the C drive is not my current directory.\nHow to get the current directory?\n"}

The second part is what I find more interesting: \"When is the appropriate time to use each one of these?\". But let me start with how I think of what each does:\nBuild: Should and usually does: generate (build) each intermediate and output file that is out-of-date with respect to its source files.\nRebuild: A workaround (hack) that allows you to build when the build command fails due to a bug with out-of-date evaluation.\nClean: A hacky implementation of deleting generated (intermediate and output) files so that a subsequent build might work. Hacky since it often doesn't delete enough. VS designers put all intermediate and output files in separate directories. Why not delete the directories?!?!?! But, I digress.\nThere is no clean\/clear way to know when to use one command vs another. Knowing what each does, does not really inform me about the appropriate situation to use each.\nIt's more about personality than science. An optimist uses Build most of the time, but resorts to Rebuild if Build fails and they think the issue is wonky behavior of Visual Studio. And if Rebuild fails, then they do Clean and Build. When that fails, they start googling...\nMore pessimistic folks always use Rebuild since its more reliable even though takes longer when used every time. The most pessimistic always do Clean then Rebuild. They forgot there is a Build command. They also wear a belt and suspenders.\nSome might think this is cynical. But, I think not.

{"question_id":4963300,"answer":"If you are using Spring 5.x \/ SpringBoot 2.x you should definitely use the Spring annotations (org.springframework.lang), as they provide you a default package-wide null check with the annotations @NonNullFields and @NonNullApi.

{"question_id":12769982,"answer":"Fatal error: Maximum execution time of XX seconds exceeded\nEvery PHP page request or script invocation measures how long PHP code has been executing. If a configured limit is reached, the script is aborted with this message.\nNote that the time generally doesn't include things that happen \"outside of\" PHP, such as time waiting for results from the database, or external programs executed with shell_exec, etc. The exception is when PHP is running on Windows, where the time measured is \"clock time\" and does include these external wait times.\nCommon causes\n\nInfinite loops. An incorrectly written while, do...while or for loop  may never complete, meaning PHP is running continuously forever. Even a foreach loop can be infinite, for instance if looping over an Iterator object or generator function.\nLarge data sets. Even if your loop is not infinite, if it is doing a lot of work, it may take too long to complete if it is processing a large number of results.\n\nChanging the limit\nIf you know that you have a slow process, you can configure the time limit:\n\nIn php.ini, using the max_execution_time setting.\nWhile the script is running, using the set_time_limit function. Note that calling this resets the measured time to zero, so set_time_limit(10); means \"allow 10 more seconds, regardless of how long the script has already taken\".\n\nBoth mechanisms should be given a number of seconds, or the special value 0 which means \"no limit\".

{"question_id":12506897,"answer":"We found that older iPhones and iPads, running iOS versions 9 & 10, occasionally return bogus blank AJAX results, perhaps due to Apple's turning down CPU speed. When returning the blank result, iOS does not call the server, as if returning a result from cache. Frequency varies widely, from roughly 10% to 30% of AJAX calls return blank.\n\nThe solution is hard to believe. Just wait 1s and call again. In our testing, only one repeat was all that was ever needed, but we wrote the code to call up to 4 times. We're not sure if the 1s wait is required, but we didn't want to risk burdening our server with bursts of repeated calls.\n\nWe found the problem happened with two different AJAX calls, calling on different API files with different data. But I'm concerned it could happen on any AJAX call. We just don't know because we don't inspect every AJAX result and we don't test every call multiple times on old devices.\n\nBoth problem AJAX calls were using: POST, Asynchronously = true, setRequestHeader = ('Content-Type', 'application\/x-www-form-urlencoded')\n\nWhen the problem happens, there's usually only one AJAX call going on. So it's not due to overlapping AJAX calls. Sometimes the problem happens when the device is busy, but sometimes not, and without DevTools we don't really know what's happening at the time.\n\niOS 13 doesn't do this, nor Chrome or Firefox. We don't have any test devices running iOS 11 or 12. Perhaps someone else could test those?\n\nI'm noting this here because this question is the top Google result when searching for this problem.\n","target":0,"question":"How do you disable browser autocomplete on web form field \/ input tags?\n\nSince the upgrade to iOS 6, we are seeing Safari's web view take the liberty of caching $.ajax calls. This is in the context of a PhoneGap application so it is using the Safari WebView. Our $.ajax calls are POST methods and we have cache set to false {cache:false}, but still this is happening. We tried manually adding a TimeStamp to the headers but it did not help.\nWe did more research and found that Safari is only returning cached results for web services that have a function signature that is static and does not change from call to call.  For instance, imagine a function called something like:\ngetNewRecordID(intRecordType)\n\nThis function receives the same input parameters over and over again, but the data it returns should be different every time.\nMust be in Apple's haste to make iOS 6 zip along impressively they got too happy with the cache settings.  Has anyone else seen this behavior on iOS 6? If so, what exactly is causing it?\n\nThe workaround that we found was to modify the function signature to be something like this:\ngetNewRecordID(intRecordType, strTimestamp)\n\nand then always pass in a TimeStamp parameter as well, and just discard that value on the server side.  This works around the issue.\n"}

{"question_id":4843173,"answer":"Use type() or isinstance()\nI don't know why not a single answer before me contains this simple type(my_variable) is str syntax, but using type() like this seems the most-logical and simple to me, by far:\n(tested in Python3):\n# Option 1: check to see if `my_variable` is of type `str`\ntype(my_variable) is str\n\n# Option 2: check to see if `my_variable` is of type `str`, including\n# being a subclass of type `str` (ie: also see if `my_variable` is any object \n# which inherits from `str` as a parent class)\nisinstance(my_variable, str)\n\nThe Python type() built-in function documentation is here: https:\/\/docs.python.org\/3\/library\/functions.html#type.

{"question_id":9271276,"answer":"The 2020 answer: it probably doesn't matter\nThe best answer here was from 2012, so I decided to test for myself.

The reasoning is generally, of this form:\n\nWhen it comes to ordering your CSS and JavaScript, you want your CSS\nto come first. The reason is that the rendering thread has all the\nstyle information it needs to render the page. If the JavaScript\nincludes come first, the JavaScript engine has to parse it all before\ncontinuing on to the next set of resources. This means the rendering\nthread can't completely show the page, since it doesn't have all the\nstyles it needs.\n\nMy actual testing reveals something quite different:\nMy test harness\nI use the following Ruby script to generate specific delays for various resources:\nrequire 'rubygems'\nrequire 'eventmachine'\nrequire 'evma_httpserver'\nrequire 'date'\n\nclass Handler  < EventMachine::Connection\n  include EventMachine::HttpServer\n\n  def process_http_request\n    resp = EventMachine::DelegatedHttpResponse.new( self )\n\n    return unless @http_query_string\n\n    path = @http_path_info\n    array = @http_query_string.split(\"&\").map{|s| s.split(\"=\")}.flatten\n    parsed = Hash[*array]\n\n    delay = parsed[\"delay\"].to_i \/ 1000.0\n    jsdelay = parsed[\"jsdelay\"].to_i\n\n    delay = 5 if (delay > 5)\n    jsdelay = 5000 if (jsdelay > 5000)\n\n    delay = 0 if (delay < 0)\n    jsdelay = 0 if (jsdelay < 0)\n\n    # Block which fulfills the request\n    operation = proc do\n      sleep delay\n\n      if path.match(\/.js$\/)\n        resp.status = 200\n        resp.headers[\"Content-Type\"] = \"text\/javascript\"\n        resp.content = \"(function(){\n            var start = new Date();\n            while(new Date() - start < #{jsdelay}){}\n          })();\"\n      end\n      if path.match(\/.css$\/)\n        resp.status = 200\n        resp.headers[\"Content-Type\"] = \"text\/css\"\n        resp.content = \"body {font-size: 50px;}\"\n      end\n    end\n\n    # Callback block to execute once the request is fulfilled\n    callback = proc do |res|\n        resp.send_response\n    end\n\n    # Let the thread pool (20 Ruby threads) handle request\n    EM.defer(operation, callback)\n  end\nend\n\nEventMachine::run {\n  EventMachine::start_server(\"0.0.0.0\", 8081, Handler)\n  puts \"Listening...\"\n}\n\nThe above mini server allows me to set arbitrary delays for JavaScript files (both server and client) and arbitrary CSS delays. For example, http:\/\/10.0.0.50:8081\/test.css?delay=500 gives me a 500\u00a0ms delay transferring the CSS.\nI use the following page to test.\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n      <title>test<\/title>\n      <script type='text\/javascript'>\n          var startTime = new Date();\n      <\/script>\n      <link href=\"http:\/\/10.0.0.50:8081\/test.css?delay=500\" type=\"text\/css\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n      <script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"http:\/\/10.0.0.50:8081\/test2.js?delay=400&amp;jsdelay=1000\"><\/script>\n  <\/head>\n  <body>\n    <p>\n      Elapsed time is:\n      <script type='text\/javascript'>\n        document.write(new Date() - startTime);\n      <\/script>\n    <\/p>\n  <\/body>\n<\/html>\n\nWhen I include the CSS first, the page takes 1.5\u00a0seconds to render:\n\nWhen I include the JavaScript first, the page takes 1.4\u00a0seconds to render:\n\nI get similar results in Chrome, Firefox and Internet\u00a0Explorer. In Opera, however, the ordering simply does not matter.\nWhat appears to be happening is that the JavaScript interpreter refuses to start until all the CSS is downloaded. So, it seems that having JavaScript includes first is more efficient as the JavaScript thread gets more run time.\nAm I missing something? Is the recommendation to place CSS includes prior to JavaScript includes not correct?\nIt is clear that we could add async or use setTimeout to free up the render thread or put the JavaScript code in the footer, or use a JavaScript loader. The point here is about ordering of essential JavaScript bits and CSS bits in the head.\n"}

Class attributes can also be assigned to, so you can change the value of MyClass.i by assignment. __doc__ is also a valid attribute, returning the docstring belonging to the class: \"A simple example class\".\n\nClass instantiation uses function notation. Just pretend that the class object is a parameterless function that returns a new instance of the class. For example:\n\nx = MyClass()\n\n\nThe instantiation operation (\u201ccalling\u201d a class object) creates an empty object. Many classes like to create objects with instances customized to a specific initial state. Therefore a class may define a special method named __init__(), like this:\n\ndef __init__(self):\n    self.data = []\n\n\nWhen a class defines an __init__() method, class instantiation automatically invokes __init__() for the newly-created class instance. So in this example, a new, initialized instance can be obtained by:\n\nx = MyClass()\n\n\nOf course, the __init__() method may have arguments for greater flexibility. In that case, arguments given to the class instantiation operator are passed on to __init__(). For example,\n\nclass Complex:\n    def __init__(self, realpart, imagpart):\n        self.r = realpart\n        self.i = imagpart\n\nx = Complex(3.0, -4.5)\nx.r, x.i\n\n\nTaken from official documentation which helped me the most in the end.\n\n\n\nHere is my example\n\nclass Bill():\n    def __init__(self,apples,figs,dates):\n        self.apples = apples\n        self.figs = figs\n        self.dates = dates\n        self.bill = apples + figs + dates\n        print (\"Buy\",self.apples,\"apples\", self.figs,\"figs \n                and\",self.dates,\"dates. \n                Total fruitty bill is\",self.bill,\" pieces of fruit :)\")\n\n\nWhen you create instance of class Bill:\n\npurchase = Bill(5,6,7)\n\n\nYou get:    \n\n> Buy 5 apples 6 figs and 7 dates. Total fruitty bill is 18  pieces of\n> fruit :)\n\n","target":0,"question":"How can I check for \"undefined\" in JavaScript?\n\nI'm learning the Python programming language and I've came across something I don't fully understand. \n\nIn a method like:\n\ndef method(self, blah):\n    def __init__(?):\n        ....\n    ....\n\n\nWhat does self do?

{"question_id":4605527,"answer":"The developer docs provide an answer on how to convert dp units to pixel units:\n\nIn some cases, you will need to express dimensions in dp and then\nconvert them to pixels.

{"question_id":6348494,"answer":"You should also consider EventDelegation for that!\nFor that reason I prefer the addEventListener and foremost using it carefully and consciously!\nFACTS:\n\nEventListeners are heavy .... (memory allocation at the client side)\nThe Events propagate IN and then OUT again in relation to the DOM\ntree. Also known as trickling-in and bubbling-out , give it a read\nin case you don't know.\n\nSo imagine an easy example:\na simple button INSIDE a div INSIDE body ...\nif you click on the button, an Event will ANYWAY\ntrickle in to BUTTON and then OUT again, like this:\nwindow-document-div-button-div-document-window\nIn the browser background (lets say the software periphery of the JS engine) the browser can ONLY possibly react to a click, if it checks for each click done where it was targeted.\nAnd to make sure that each possible event listener on the way is triggered, it kinda has to send the \"click event signal\" all the way from document level down into the element ... and back out again.\nThis behavior can then made use of by attaching EventListeners using e.g.:\ndocument.getElementById(\"exampleID\").addEventListener(\"click\",(event) => {doThis}, true\/false);\n\nJust note for reference that the true\/false as the last argument of the addEventListener method controls the behavior in terms of when is the event recognized - when trickling in or when bubbling out.\nTRUE means, the event is recognized while trickling-in\nFALSE means, the event is recognized on its way bubbling out\nImplementing the following 2 helpful concepts also turns out much more intuitive using the above stated approach to handle:\n\nYou can also use event.stopPropagation() within the function\n(example ref. \"doThis\") to prevents further propagation of the\ncurrent event in the capturing and bubbling phases. It does not,\nhowever, prevent any default behaviors from occurring; for instance,\nclicks on links are still processed.\nIf you want to stop those behaviors, you could use\nevent.preventDefault() within the function (example ref.\n\"doThis\"). With that you could for example tell the Browser that if\nthe event does not get explicitly handled, its default action should\nnot be taken as it normally would be.\n\nAlso just note here for reference again: the last argument of the addEventListener method (true\/false) also controls at which phase (trickling-in TRUE or bubbling out FALSE) the eventual effect of \".stopPropagation()\" kicks in.\nSo ... in case you apply an EventListener with flag TRUE to an element, and combine that with the .stopPropagation() method, the event would not even get through to potential inner children of the element\nTo wrap it up:\nIf you use the onClick variant in HTML ... there are 2 downsides for me:\n\nWith addEventListener, you can attach multiple onClick-events to the same, respectively one single element, but thats not possible using onClick (at least thats what I strongly believe up to now, correct me if I am wrong).\nAlso the following aspect is truly remarkable here ... especially the code maintenance part (didn't elaborate on this so far):\n\n\nIn regards to event delegation, it really boils down to this. If some\nother JavaScript code needs to respond to a click event, using\naddEventListener ensures you both can respond to it. If you both try\nusing onclick, then one stomps on the other. You both can't respond if\nyou want an onclick on the same element. Furthermore, you want to keep your behavior as separate as you can from the HTML in case you need to change it later. It would suck to have 50 HTML files to update instead of one JavaScript file.\n(credit to Greg Burghardt, addEventListener vs onclick with regards to event delegation )\n\n\nThis is also known by the term \"Unobtrusive JavaScript\" ... give it a read!\n\n","target":0,"question":"How to mkdir only if a directory does not already exist?\n\nWhat's the difference between addEventListener and onclick?\nvar h = document.getElementById(\"a\");\nh.onclick = dothing1;\nh.addEventListener(\"click\", dothing2);\n\nThe code above resides together in a separate .js file, and they both work perfectly.\n"}

{"question_id":8228281,"answer":"TL;DR: Expressions can be enclosed in parenthesis, which would conflict with function calling if the expression and block forms of function were combined.\nI like counter-examples because they paint a great picture of the logic, and noone else listed any. You might ask, \"Why can't the browser see function(){}() and just assume its an expression?\" Let's juxtapose the issue with three examples.\n\r\n\r\nvar x;\n\n\/\/ Here, fibonacci is a block function\nfunction fibonacci(x) {\n    var value = x < 2 ? x : fibonacci(x-1) + fibonacci(x-2);\n    if (x === 9) console.log(\"The \" + x + \"th fibonacci is: \" + value);\n    return value;\n}\n\n(x = 9);\n\nconsole.log(\"Value of x: \" + x);\nconsole.log(\"fibonacci is a(n) \" + typeof fibonacci);\r\n\r\n\r\n\nObserve how things change when we turn the function into an expression.\n\r\n\r\nvar x;\n\n\/\/ Here, fibonacci is a function expression\n(function fibonacci(x) {\n    var value = x < 2 ? x : fibonacci(x-1) + fibonacci(x-2);\n    if (x === 9) console.log(\"The \" + x + \"th fibonacci is: \" + value);\n    return value;\n})\n\n(x = 9);\n\nconsole.log(\"Value of x: \" + x);\nconsole.log(\"fibonacci is a(n) \" + typeof fibonacci);\r\n\r\n\r\n\nThe same thing happens when you use the not-operator instead of parenthesis because both operators turn the statement into an expression:\n\r\n\r\nvar x;\n\n\/\/ Here, fibonacci is a function expression\n! function fibonacci(x) {\n    var value = x < 2 ? x : fibonacci(x-1) + fibonacci(x-2);\n    if (x === 9) console.log(\"The \" + x + \"th fibonacci is: \" + value);\n    return value;\n}\n\n(x = 9);\n\nconsole.log(\"Value of x: \" + x);\nconsole.log(\"fibonacci is a(n) \" + typeof fibonacci);\r\n\r\n\r\n\nBy turning the function into an expression, it gets executed by the (x = 9) two lines down from it. Thanks to separate behaviors for expression functions and block functions, both examples run fine without ambiguity (specs-wise).\nName Scoping\nAnother important observation is that named block functions are visible to the entire scope, whereas function expressions are only visible to themselves. In other words, fibonacci is only visible to the last console.log when it is a block in the first example. In all three examples, fibonacci is visible to itself, allowing fibonacci to call itself, which is recursion.\nArrow Functions\nAnother aspect to the logic is arrow functions. The specs would have had to include arbitrary rules and exceptions for arrow functions if the definitions of block and expression functions were merged together:\n\r\n\r\nfunction hello() {console.log(\"Hello World\")}\n(x) => console.log(\"hello \" + x)\nconsole.log(\"If you are reading this, no errors occurred\");\r\n\r\n\r\n\nAlthough function blocks work fine, function expressions followed by an arrow function produce a syntax error:\n\r\n\r\n! function hello() {console.log(\"Hello World\")}\n(x) => console.log(\"hello \" + x)\nconsole.log(\"If you are reading this, no errors occurred\");\r\n\r\n\r\n\nHere, it is ambiguous whether the (x) on line two is calling the function  on the preceding line or whether it is the function arguments for an arrow function.\nNote that arrow functions have been indeed to the ECMAScript standard over the years and were not a factor in the initial design of the language; my point is that a differentiation between expression and block functions helps JavaScript syntax to be a little more logical and coherent.\n","target":0,"question":"Set a default parameter value for a JavaScript function\n\nI would like to know what this means:\n(function () {\n\n})();\n\nIs this basically saying document.onload?\n"}

Both forms are equivalent in GNU make; however only the \u2018::=\u2019 form is described by the POSIX standard [...] 2012.\n\n\nThe value of a simply expanded variable is scanned once and for all, expanding any references to other variables and functions, when the variable is defined.\n\nNot much to add. It's evaluated immediately, including recursive expansion of, well, recursively expanded variables.\nThe catch: If VARIABLE refers to ANOTHER_VARIABLE:\nVARIABLE := $(ANOTHER_VARIABLE)-yohoho\n\nand ANOTHER_VARIABLE is not defined before this assignment, ANOTHER_VARIABLE will expand to an empty value.\nAssign if not set\nFOO ?= bar\n\nis equivalent to\nifeq ($(origin FOO), undefined)\nFOO = bar\nendif\n\nwhere $(origin FOO) equals to undefined only if the variable was not set at all.\nThe catch: if FOO was set to an empty string, either in makefiles, shell environment, or command line overrides, it will not be assigned bar.\nAppending\nVAR += bar\n\nAppending:\n\nWhen the variable in question has not been defined before, \u2018+=\u2019 acts just like normal \u2018=\u2019: it defines a recursively-expanded variable. However, when there is a previous definition, exactly what \u2018+=\u2019 does depends on what flavor of variable you defined originally.\n\nSo, this will print foo bar:\nVAR = foo\n# ... a mile of code\nVAR += $(BAR)\nBAR = bar\n$(info $(VAR))\n\nbut this will print foo:\nVAR := foo\n# ... a mile of code\nVAR += $(BAR)\nBAR = bar\n$(info $(VAR))\n\nThe catch is that += behaves differently depending on what type of variable VAR was assigned before.\nMultiline values\nThe syntax to assign multiline value to a variable is:\ndefine VAR_NAME :=\nline\nline\nendef\n\nor\ndefine VAR_NAME =\nline\nline\nendef\n\nAssignment operator can be omitted, then it creates a recursively-expanded variable.\ndefine VAR_NAME\nline\nline\nendef\n\nThe last newline before endef is removed.\nBonus: the shell assignment operator \u2018!=\u2019\n HASH != printf '\\043'\n\nis the same as\nHASH := $(shell printf '\\043')\n\nDon't use it. $(shell) call is more readable, and the usage of both in a makefiles is highly discouraged.

{"question_id":346372,"answer":"I tend to use just 2 terms - Fake and Mock.\nMock only when using a mocking framework like Moq for example because it doesn't seem right to refer to it as a Fake when it's being created with new Mock<ISomething>() - while you can technically use a mocking framework to create Stubs or Fakes, it just seems kind of dumb to call it that in this situation - it has to be a Mock.\nFake for everything else.

How do you define these for your tests?  Describe situations where you might use each.\n\nHere is how I use them:\n\nFake: a class that implements an interface but contains fixed data and no logic.  Simply returns \"good\" or \"bad\" data depending on the implementation.\n\nMock: a class that implements an interface and allows the ability to dynamically set the values to return\/exceptions to throw from particular methods and provides the ability to check if particular methods have been called\/not called.\n\nStub: Like a mock class, except that it doesn't provide the ability to verify that methods have been called\/not called.\n\nMocks and stubs can be hand generated or generated by a mocking framework.  Fake classes are generated by hand.  I use mocks primarily to verify interactions between my class and dependent classes.  I use stubs once I have verified the interactions and am testing alternate paths through my code.  I use fake classes primarily to abstract out data dependencies or when mocks\/stubs are too tedious to set up each time.\n"}

{"question_id":1623914,"answer":"The other answers address SAPIs implementations, and while this is relevant the question asks the difference between the thread-safe vs non thread-safe distributions.\nFirst, PHP is compiled as an embeddable library, such as libphp.so on *NIX and php.dll on Windows. This library can be embedded into any C\/CPP application, but obviously it is primarily used on web servers. At it's core PHP starts up in in two major phases, the module init phase and then request init phase. Module init initializes the PHP core and all extensions, where request init initializes PHP userspace - both native userspace features as well as PHP code itself.\nThe PHP library is setup to where the module phase only has to be called on once, but the request phase has to be reinitialized for each HTTP request. Note that CLI links to the same library as mod_php ect, and still has to go through these phases internally even though it may not be used in the context of processing HTTP requests. Also, it's important to note that PHP isn't literally designed for processing HTTP requests - most accurately, it is designed for processing CGI events. Again, this isn't just php-cgi, but all SAPI\/applications including php-fpm, mod_php, CLI and even the exceedingly rare PHP desktop application.\nWebservers (or more typically SAPIs) that link to libphp tend to follow one of four patterns:\n\ncreate a completely new instance of a PHP per request (old CGI pattern, not common and obviously not recommended)\ncreate one PHP instance, but go though both initialization phases (together) in separate forked child processes\ncreate one PHP instance, do module init once in parent process pre-fork, and then the individual request phase post-fork per HTTP request\n\nNote that in examples 2 and 3 the child process is typically terminated after each request. In example 2 the child process must be terminated at the end of each request.\nThe forth example is related to threaded implementations\n\ncall module init once in main thread, then call request init within other threads.\n\nIn the threaded case, request handling threads tend to utilize a thread pool, with each thread running in a loop initializing the request phase at the beginning and than destroying the request phase at the end which is more optimal than spawning a new thread per request\nRegardless of how threaded implementations utilize libphp, if the module phase is initialized in one thread and request phases are called in different threads (which is the case PHP was designed for) it requires a non-trivial amount of synchronization, not just within the PHP core, but also within all native PHP extensions. Note that this is not just a matter of a \u201crequest\u201d at this point, but synchronization that it being called on per PHP OPCODE that relies on any form of resource within the PHP core (or any PHP extension) which exists in a different thread as PHP userspace.\nThis places a huge demand on synchronization within thread-safe PHP distributions, which is why PHP tends to follow a \"share nothing\" rule which helps minimize the impact, but there is no such thing as truly \"sharing nothing\" in this pattern, unless each thread contains a completely separate PHP context, where the module phase and request phase is all done within the same thread per request which is not suggested or supported. If the context built within the module init phase is in a separate thread as the request init phase there will most definitely be sharing between threads. So the best attempt is made to minimize context within the module init phase that must be shared between threads, but this is not easy and in some cases not possible.\nThis is especially true in more complicated extensions which have their own requirements of how a their own context must be shared between threads, with openssl being a major culprit of of this example which effectually extends outward to any extension that uses it, whether internal such as PHP stream handlers or external such as sockets, curl, database extensions, etc.\nIf not obvious at this point, thread-safe vs non thread-safe is not just a matter of how PHP works internally as a \u201crequest handler\u201d within an SAPI implementation, but a matter of how PHP works internally as an embedded virtual machine for a programming language.\nThis is all made possible by the TSRM, or the thread safe resource manager, which is well made and handles a very large amount of synchronization with little perceived overhead, but the overhead is definitely there and will grow not just based on how many requests per second that the server must handle (the deciding factor on how may threads the SAPI requires), but also by how much PHP code is used per request (or per execution). In other words, large bloated frameworks can make a real difference when it comes specifically to TSRM overhead. This isn't to speak of overall PHP performance and resource requirements within thread-safe PHP, but just the additional overhead of TSRM itself within thread-safe PHP.\nAs such, pre compiled PHP is distributed in two flavors, one built where TSRM is active in libphp (thread-safe) and one where libphp does not use any TSRM features (non thread-safe) and thus does not have the overhead of TSRM.\nAlso note that the flag used to compile PHP with TSRM (--enable-maintainer-zts or --with-zts in later PHP versions) causes phpize to extend this outward into the compilation of extensions and how they initialize their own libraries (libssl, libzip, libcurl, etc) which  will often have their own way of compiling for thread-safe vs non thread-safe implementations, i.e their own synchronization mechanisms outside of TSRM and PHP as a whole. While this not exactly PHP related, in the end will still have effect on PHP performance outside of TSRM (meaning on top of TSRM). As such, PHP extensions (and their dependents, as well as external libraries PHP or extensions link to or otherwise depend on) will often have different attributes in thead-safe PHP distributions.\n","target":0,"question":"What is the purpose of .PHONY in a Makefile?\n\nI saw different binaries for PHP, like non-thread or thread safe?\n\nWhat does this mean? \n\nWhat is the difference between these packages?\n"}

Then you would resize the column, and had to change a lot of connected software, fix introduced bugs, which is all very cumbersome.\nModern systems allow for unlimited string storage with dynamic storage allocation, so the incidental large string would be stored just fine without much waste of storage of small data items.\nWhile a lot of programming languages have adopted a data type of 'string' with unlimited size, like C#, javascript, java, etc, a database like Oracle did not.\nNow that PostgreSQL supports 'text', a lot of programmers are still used to VARCHAR(N), and reason like: yes, text is the same as VARCHAR, except that with VARCHAR you MAY add a limit N, so VARCHAR is more flexible.\nYou might as well reason, why should we bother using VARCHAR without N, now that we can simplify our life with TEXT?\nIn my recent years with Oracle, I have used CHAR(N) or VARCHAR(N) on very few occasions.

No more emphasis on the VAR feature of the CHAR type. No more emphasis on let's use VARCHAR without N.

{"question_id":11241523,"answer":"Aside from local\/global variable store times, opcode prediction makes the function faster.\n\nAs the other answers explain, the function uses the STORE_FAST opcode in the loop. Here's the bytecode for the function's loop:\n\n    >>   13 FOR_ITER                 6 (to 22)   # get next value from iterator\n         16 STORE_FAST               0 (x)       # set local variable\n         19 JUMP_ABSOLUTE           13           # back to FOR_ITER\n\n\nNormally when a program is run, Python executes each opcode one after the other, keeping track of the a stack and preforming other checks on the stack frame after each opcode is executed. Opcode prediction means that in certain cases Python is able to jump directly to the next opcode, thus avoiding some of this overhead.\n\nIn this case, every time Python sees FOR_ITER (the top of the loop), it will \"predict\" that STORE_FAST is the next opcode it has to execute. Python then peeks at the next opcode and, if the prediction was correct, it jumps straight to STORE_FAST. This has the effect of squeezing the two opcodes into a single opcode.\n\nOn the other hand, the STORE_NAME opcode is used in the loop at the global level. Python does *not* make similar predictions when it sees this opcode. Instead, it must go back to the top of the evaluation-loop which has obvious implications for the speed at which the loop is executed.\n\nTo give some more technical detail about this optimization, here's a quote from the ceval.c file (the \"engine\" of Python's virtual machine):\n\n\n  Some opcodes tend to come in pairs thus making it possible to\n   predict the second code when the first is run.  For example,\n   GET_ITER is often followed by FOR_ITER. And FOR_ITER is often\n   followed by STORE_FAST or UNPACK_SEQUENCE.\n  \n  Verifying the prediction costs a single high-speed test of a register\n      variable against a constant.  If the pairing was good, then the\n      processor's own internal branch predication has a high likelihood of\n      success, resulting in a nearly zero-overhead transition to the\n      next opcode.  A successful prediction saves a trip through the eval-loop\n      including its two unpredictable branches, the HAS_ARG test and the\n      switch-case.  Combined with the processor's internal branch prediction,\n      a successful PREDICT has the effect of making the two opcodes run as if\n      they were a single new opcode with the bodies combined.\n\n\nWe can see in the source code for the FOR_ITER opcode exactly where the prediction for STORE_FAST is made:\n\ncase FOR_ITER:                         \/\/ the FOR_ITER opcode case\n    v = TOP();\n    x = (*v->ob_type->tp_iternext)(v); \/\/ x is the next value from iterator\n    if (x != NULL) {                     \n        PUSH(x);                       \/\/ put x on top of the stack\n        PREDICT(STORE_FAST);           \/\/ predict STORE_FAST will follow - success!\n        PREDICT(UNPACK_SEQUENCE);      \/\/ this and everything below is skipped\n        continue;\n    }\n    \/\/ error-checking and more code for when the iterator ends normally                                     \n\n\nThe PREDICT function expands to if (*next_instr == op) goto PRED_##op i.e. we just jump to the start of the predicted opcode. In this case, we jump here:\n\nPREDICTED_WITH_ARG(STORE_FAST);\ncase STORE_FAST:\n    v = POP();                     \/\/ pop x back off the stack\n    SETLOCAL(oparg, v);            \/\/ set it as the new local variable\n    goto fast_next_opcode;\n\n\nThe local variable is now set and the next opcode is up for execution.

{"question_id":10398931,"answer":"For doing such a thing there are a lot of different ways. A further way could be the following:\n\r\n\r\nlet str = 'data-123';\nstr = str.split('-')[1];\nconsole.log('The remaining string is:\\n' + str);\r\n\r\n\r\n\nBasically the above code splits the string at the '-' char into two array elements and gets the second one, that is the one with the index 1, ignoring the first array element at the 0 index.\nThe following is one liner version:\n\r\n\r\nconsole.log('The remaining string is:\\n' + 'data-123'.split('-')[1]);\r\n\r\n\r\n\nAnother possible approach would be to add a method to the String prototype as follows:\n\r\n\r\nString.prototype.remove = function (s){return this.replace(s,'')}\n\n\/\/ After that it will be used like this:\n\na = 'ktkhkiksk kiksk ktkhkek kcklkekaknk kmkekskskakgkekk';\na = a.remove('k');\nconsole.log(a);\r\n\r\n\r\n\nNotice the above snippet will allow to remove only the first instance of the string you are interested to remove. But you can improve it a bit as follows:\n\r\n\r\nString.prototype.removeAll = function (s){return this.replaceAll(s,'')}\n\n\/\/ After that it will be used like this:\n\na = 'ktkhkiksk kiksk ktkhkek kcklkekaknk kmkekskskakgkekk';\na = a.removeAll('k');\nconsole.log(a);\r\n\r\n\r\n\nThe above snippet instead will remove all instances of the string passed to the method.\nOf course you don't need to implement the functions into the prototype of the String object: you can implement them as simple functions too if you wish (I will show the remove all function, for the other you will need to use just replace instead of replaceAll, so it is trivial to implement):\n\r\n\r\nfunction strRemoveAll(s,r)\n{\n    return s.replaceAll(r,'');\n}\n\n\/\/ you can use it as:\n\nlet a = 'ktkhkiksk kiksk ktkhkek kcklkekaknk kmkekskskakgkekk'\nb = strRemoveAll (a,'k');\nconsole.log(b);\r\n\r\n\r\n\nOf course much more is possible.\n","target":0,"question":"JavaScript check if variable exists (is defined\/initialized)\n\nI've got a data-123 string.\n\nHow can I remove data- from the string while leaving the 123?\n"}

{"question_id":392473,"answer":"Visual Studio 2017 and newer support a new lightweight .csproj format which has come to be known as \"SDK format\".

{"question_id":383947,"answer":"Coding to an interface is a philosophy, rather than specific language constructs or design patterns - it instructs you what is the correct order of steps to follow in order to create better software systems (e.g. more resilient, more testable, more scalable, more extendible, and other nice traits).\nWhat it actually means is:\n===\nBefore jumping to implementations and coding (the HOW) - think of the WHAT:\n\nWhat black boxes should make up your system,\nWhat is each box' responsibility,\nWhat are the ways each \"client\" (that is, one of those other boxes, 3rd party \"boxes\", or even humans) should communicate with it (the API of each box).\n\nAfter you figure the above, go ahead and implement those boxes (the HOW).\nThinking first of what a box' is and what its API, leads the developer to distil the box' responsibility, and to mark for himself and future developers the difference between what is its exposed details (\"API\") and it's hidden details (\"implementation details\"), which is a very important differentiation to have.\nOne immediate and easily noticeable gain is the team can then change and improve implementations without affecting the general architecture. It also makes the system MUCH more testable (it goes well with the TDD approach).\n===\nBeyond the traits I've mentioned above, you also save A LOT OF TIME going this direction.\nMicro Services and DDD, when done right, are great examples of \"Coding to an interface\", however the concept wins in every pattern from monoliths to \"serverless\", from BE to FE, from OOP to functional, etc....\nI strongly recommend this approach for Software Engineering (and I basically believe it makes total sense in other fields as well).\n","target":0,"question":"How to check if a variable is set in Bash\n\nI have seen this mentioned a few times and I am not clear on what it means.

{"question_id":154136,"answer":"Jens Gustedt's P99 preprocessor library (yes, the fact that such a thing exists blew my mind too!) improves on the if(1) { ... } else construct in a small but significant way by defining the following:\n\n#define P99_NOP ((void)0)\n#define P99_PREFER(...) if (1) { __VA_ARGS__ } else\n#define P99_BLOCK(...) P99_PREFER(__VA_ARGS__) P99_NOP\n\n\nThe rationale for this is that, unlike the do { ... } while(0) construct, break and continue still work inside the given block, but the ((void)0) creates a syntax error if the semicolon is omitted after the macro call, which would otherwise skip the next block.

I'm trying to find a broadly-compatible way of doing that without ending up with relative or funky-looking paths. I only need to support Bash, not sh, csh, etc.\n\nWhat I've found so far:\n\n\nThe accepted answer to Getting the source directory of a Bash script from within addresses getting the path of the script via dirname $0, which is fine, but that may return a relative path (like .), which is a problem if you want to change directories in the script and have the path still point to the script's directory. Still, dirname will be part of the puzzle.\nThe accepted answer to Bash script absolute path with OS X (OS X specific, but the answer works regardless) gives a function that will test to see if $0 looks relative and if so will pre-pend $PWD to it. But the result can still have relative bits in it (although overall it's absolute)\u00a0\u2014 for instance, if the script is t in the directory \/usr\/bin and you're in \/usr and you type bin\/..\/bin\/t to run it (yes, that's convoluted), you end up with \/usr\/bin\/..\/bin as the script's directory path. Which works, but...\nThe readlink solution on this page, which looks like this:\n\n# Absolute path to this script. \/home\/user\/bin\/foo.sh\nSCRIPT=$(readlink -f $0)\n# Absolute path this script is in. \/home\/user\/bin\nSCRIPTPATH=`dirname $SCRIPT`\n\n\nBut readlink isn't POSIX and apparently the solution relies on GNU's readlink where BSD's won't work for some reason (I don't have access to a BSD-like system to check).\n\n\nSo, various ways of doing it, but they all have their caveats.\n\nWhat would be a better way? Where \"better\" means:\n\n\nGives me the absolute path.\nTakes out funky bits even when invoked in a convoluted way (see comment on #2 above). (E.g., at least moderately canonicalizes the path.)\nRelies only on Bash-isms or things that are almost certain to be on most popular flavors of *nix systems (GNU\/Linux, BSD and BSD-like systems like OS\u00a0X, etc.).\nAvoids calling external programs if possible (e.g., prefers Bash built-ins).\n(Updated, thanks for the heads up, wich) It doesn't have to resolve symlinks (in fact, I'd kind of prefer it left them alone, but that's not a requirement).\n\n"}

The man page of grep says:\n--include=PATTERN     Recurse in directories only searching file matching PATTERN.\n--exclude=PATTERN     Recurse in directories skip file matching PATTERN.\n\nSearching on grep include, grep include exclude, grep exclude and variants did not find anything relevant\nIf there's a better way of grepping only in certain files, I'm all for it; moving the offending files is not an option. I can't search only certain directories (the directory structure is a big mess, with everything everywhere). Also, I can't install anything, so I have to do with common tools (like grep or the suggested find).\n"}
{"question_id":1590247,"answer":"As many have said: native array using push and pop is fine for a stack, but using shift for taking elements from a queue means that the remaining elements need to move, which is potentially slow. The idea of using two stacks to make a queue in kevinyu's answer is a nice idea to fix it, and of course that can be done with native-array-stacks as well. (Edit: there was actually already an answer by Yuki-Dreamer that does this, albeit less compactly. I didn't notice it until now because it was unfairly downvoted.)\nHere's a compact implementation using some ES5\/ES6 features that makes a queue object which behaves as closely as possible to the native-push\/shift variant, except that it takes amortized O(1) time per operation:\nconst queue = () => {\n    const a = [], b = [];\n    return {\n        push: (...elts) => a.push(...elts),\n        shift: () => {\n            if (b.length === 0) {\n                while (a.length > 0) { b.push(a.pop()) }\n            }\n            return b.pop();\n        },\n        get length() { return a.length + b.length }\n    }\n}\n\nNow you can do:\nconst q = queue();\nq.push(8);\nq.push(9);\nq.push(10);\nconsole.log(q.length);          \/\/ outputs 3\nconsole.log(q.shift());         \/\/ outputs 8\nq.push(11);\nconsole.log(q.shift());         \/\/ outputs 9\nconsole.log(q.shift());         \/\/ outputs 10\nconsole.log(q.shift());         \/\/ outputs 11\nconsole.log(q.shift());         \/\/ outputs undefined\n\nThe queue implementation uses a getter syntax for length, to make it look like a property, and rest parameter syntax for push to allow pushing more than one thing at a time. If you don't want that, you can replace line 4 with push: elt => a.push(elt),. (Note, however, that you can not replace it with push: a.push, like I tried first myself with really weird results: that's because it results in the native push method being called with this set to the queue object.)\n","target":0,"question":"How do I calculate someone's age based on a DateTime type birthday?\n\nWhat is the best way to implement a Stack and a Queue in JavaScript?\n\nI'm looking to do the shunting-yard algorithm and I'm going to need these data-structures.\n"}

{"question_id":7662,"answer":"I hear the argument all the time that whether or not a table is pluralized is all a matter of personal taste and there is no best practice.  I don't believe that is true, especially as a programmer as opposed to a DBA.  As far as I am aware, there are no legitimate reasons to pluralize a table name other than \"It just makes sense to me because it's a collection of objects,\" while there are legitimate gains in code by having singular table names.  For example:\n\n\nIt avoids bugs and mistakes caused by plural ambiguities.  Programmers aren't exactly known for their spelling expertise, and pluralizing some words are confusing.  For example, does the plural word end in 'es' or just 's'?  Is it persons or people?  When you work on a project with large teams, this can become an issue.  For example, an instance where a team member uses the incorrect method to pluralize a table he creates.  By the time I interact with this table, it is used all over in code I don't have access to or would take too long to fix.  The result is I have to remember to spell the table wrong every time I use it. Something very similar to this happened to me.  The easier you can make it for every member of the team to consistently and easily use the exact, correct table names without errors or having to look up table names all the time, the better. The singular version is much easier to handle in a team environment.\nIf you use the singular version of a table name AND prefix the primary key with the table name, you now have the advantage of easily determining a table name from a primary key or vice versa via code alone.  You can be given a variable with a table name in it, concatenate \"Id\" to the end, and you now have the primary key of the table via code, without having to do an additional query.  Or you can cut off \"Id\" from the end of a primary key to determine a table name via code.  If you use \"id\" without a table name for the primary key, then you cannot via code determine the table name from the primary key.  In addition, most people who pluralize table names and prefix PK columns with the table name use the singular version of the table name in the PK (for example statuses and status_id), making it impossible to do this at all.\nIf you make table names singular, you can have them match the class names they represent.  Once again, this can simplify code and allow you to do really neat things, like instantiating a class by having nothing but the table name.  It also just makes your code more consistent, which leads to...\nIf you make the table name singular, it makes your naming scheme consistent, organized, and easy to maintain in every location.  You know that in every instance in your code, whether it's in a column name, as a class name, or as the table name, it's the same exact name.  This allows you to do global searches to see everywhere that data is used.  When you pluralize a table name, there will be cases where you will use the singular version of that table name (the class it turns into, in the primary key).  It just makes sense to not have some instances where your data is referred to as plural and some instances singular.\n\n\nTo sum it up, if you pluralize your table names you are losing all sorts of advantages in making your code smarter and easier to handle.  There may even be cases where you have to have lookup tables\/arrays to convert your table names to object or local code names you could have avoided.  Singular table names, though perhaps feeling a little weird at first, offer significant advantages over pluralized names and I believe are best practice.\n","target":0,"question":"Retrieve the position (X,Y) of an HTML element\n\nWhenever I design a database, I always wonder if there is a best way of naming an item in my database.

{"question_id":924285,"answer":"Double-brace initialization is an unnecessary hack that can introduce memory leaks and other issues\n\nThere's no legitimate reason to use this \"trick\". Guava provides nice immutable collections that include both static factories and builders, allowing you to populate your collection where it's declared in a clean, readable, and safe syntax.\n\nThe example in the question becomes:\n\nSet<String> flavors = ImmutableSet.of(\n    \"vanilla\", \"strawberry\", \"chocolate\", \"butter pecan\");\n\n\nNot only is this shorter and easier to read, but it avoids the numerous issues with the double-braced pattern described in other answers. Sure, it performs similarly to a directly-constructed HashMap, but it's dangerous and error-prone, and there are better options.\n\nAny time you find yourself considering double-braced initialization you should re-examine your APIs or introduce new ones to properly address the issue, rather than take advantage of syntactic tricks.\n\nError-Prone now flags this anti-pattern.\n","target":0,"question":"Programmatically navigate using React router\n\nIn Hidden Features of Java the top answer mentions Double Brace Initialization, with a very enticing syntax:\n\nSet<String> flavors = new HashSet<String>() {{\n    add(\"vanilla\");\n    add(\"strawberry\");\n    add(\"chocolate\");\n    add(\"butter pecan\");\n}};\n\n\nThis idiom creates an anonymous inner class with just an instance initializer in it, which \"can use any [...] methods in the containing scope\".  \n\nMain question: Is this as inefficient as it sounds?  Should its use be limited to one-off initializations?  (And of course showing off!)\n\nSecond question: The new HashSet must be the \"this\" used in the instance initializer ... can anyone shed light on the mechanism?  \n\nThird question: Is this idiom too obscure to use in production code?\n\nSummary: Very, very nice answers, thanks everyone. On question (3), people felt the syntax should be clear (though I'd recommend an occasional comment, especially if your code will pass on to developers who may not be familiar with it).  \n\nOn question (1), the generated code should run quickly. The extra .class files do cause jar file clutter, and slow program startup slightly (thanks to @coobird for measuring that). @Thilo pointed out that garbage collection can be affected, and the memory cost for the extra loaded classes may be a factor in some cases.  \n\nQuestion (2) turned out to be most interesting to me. If I understand the answers, what's happening in DBI is that the anonymous inner class extends the class of the object being constructed by the new operator, and hence has a \"this\" value referencing the instance being constructed. Very neat.\n\nOverall, DBI strikes me as something of an intellectual curiousity.  Coobird and others point out you can achieve the same effect with Arrays.asList, varargs methods, Google Collections, and the proposed Java 7 Collection literals.  Newer JVM languages like Scala, JRuby, and Groovy also offer concise notations for list construction, and interoperate well with Java.  Given that DBI clutters up the classpath, slows down class loading a bit, and makes the code a tad more obscure, I'd probably shy away from it. However, I plan to spring this on a friend who's just gotten his SCJP and loves good natured jousts about Java semantics!  ;-)  Thanks everyone!\n\n7\/2017: Baeldung has a good summary of double brace initialization and considers it an anti-pattern.\n\n12\/2017: @Basil Bourque notes that in the new Java 9 you can say:\n\nSet<String> flavors = Set.of(\"vanilla\", \"strawberry\", \"chocolate\", \"butter pecan\");\n\n\nThat's for sure the way to go.

{"question_id":949433,"answer":"Your question was probably not, \"Why are these constructs undefined behavior in C?\".  Your question was probably, \"Why did this code (using ++) not give me the value I expected?\", and someone marked your question as a duplicate, and sent you here.\nThis answer tries to answer that question: why did your code not give you the answer you expected, and how can you learn to recognize (and avoid) expressions that will not work as expected.\nI assume you've heard the basic definition of C's ++ and -- operators by now, and how the prefix form ++x differs from the postfix form x++.  But these operators are hard to think about, so to make sure you understood, perhaps you wrote a tiny little test program involving something like\nint x = 5;\nprintf(\"%d %d %d\\n\", x, ++x, x++);\n\nBut, to your surprise, this program did not help you understand \u2014 it printed some strange, inexplicable output, suggesting that maybe ++ does something completely different, not at all what you thought it did.\nOr, perhaps you're looking at a hard-to-understand expression like\nint x = 5;\nx = x++ + ++x;\nprintf(\"%d\\n\", x);\n\nPerhaps someone gave you that code as a puzzle.  This code also makes no sense, especially if you run it \u2014 and if you compile and run it under two different compilers, you're likely to get two different answers!  What's up with that?  Which answer is correct?  (And the answer is that both of them are, or neither of them are.)\nAs you've heard by now, these expressions are undefined, which means that the C language makes no guarantee about what they'll do.  This is a strange and unsettling result, because you probably thought that any program you could write, as long as it compiled and ran, would generate a unique, well-defined output.  But in the case of undefined behavior, that's not so.\nWhat makes an expression undefined?  Are expressions involving ++ and -- always undefined?  Of course not: these are useful operators, and if you use them properly, they're perfectly well-defined.\nFor the expressions we're talking about, what makes them undefined is when there's too much going on at once, when we can't tell what order things will happen in, but when the order matters to the result we'll get.\nLet's go back to the two examples I've used in this answer.  When I wrote\nprintf(\"%d %d %d\\n\", x, ++x, x++);\n\nthe question is, before actually calling printf, does the compiler compute the value of x first, or x++, or maybe ++x?  But it turns out we don't know.  There's no rule in C which says that the arguments to a function get evaluated left-to-right, or right-to-left, or in some other order.  So we can't say whether the compiler will do x first, then ++x, then x++, or x++ then ++x then x, or some other order.  But the order clearly matters, because depending on which order the compiler uses, we'll clearly get a different series of numbers printed out.\nWhat about this crazy expression?\nx = x++ + ++x;\n\nThe problem with this expression is that it contains three different attempts to modify the value of x: (1) the x++ part tries to take x's value, add 1, store the new value in x, and return the old value; (2) the ++x part tries to take x's value, add 1, store the new value in x, and return the new value; and (3) the x = part tries to assign the sum of the other two back to x.  Which of those three attempted assignments will \"win\"?  Which of the three values will actually determine the final value of x?  Again, and perhaps surprisingly, there's no rule in C to tell us.\nYou might imagine that precedence or associativity or left-to-right evaluation tells you what order things happen in, but they do not.  You may not believe me, but please take my word for it, and I'll say it again: precedence and associativity do not determine every aspect of the evaluation order of an expression in C.  In particular, if within one expression there are multiple different spots where we try to assign a new value to something like x, precedence and associativity do not tell us which of those attempts happens first, or last, or anything.\n\nSo with all that background and introduction out of the way, if you want to make sure that all your programs are well-defined, which expressions can you write, and which ones can you not write?\nThese expressions are all fine:\ny = x++;\nz = x++ + y++;\nx = x + 1;\nx = a[i++];\nx = a[i++] + b[j++];\nx[i++] = a[j++] + b[k++];\nx = *p++;\nx = *p++ + *q++;\n\nThese expressions are all undefined:\nx = x++;\nx = x++ + ++x;\ny = x + x++;\na[i] = i++;\na[i++] = i;\nprintf(\"%d %d %d\\n\", x, ++x, x++);\n\nAnd the last question is, how can you tell which expressions are well-defined, and which expressions are undefined?\nAs I said earlier, the undefined expressions are the ones where there's too much going at once, where you can't be sure what order things happen in, and where the order matters:\n\nIf there's one variable that's getting modified (assigned to) in two or more different places, how do you know which modification happens first?\nIf there's a variable that's getting modified in one place, and having its value used in another place, how do you know whether it uses the old value or the new value?\n\nAs an example of #1, in the expression\nx = x++ + ++x;\n\nthere are three attempts to modify x.\nAs an example of #2, in the expression\ny = x + x++;\n\nwe both use the value of x, and modify it.\nSo that's the answer: make sure that in any expression you write, each variable is modified at most once, and if a variable is modified, you don't also attempt to use the value of that variable somewhere else.\n\nOne more thing.  You might be wondering how to \"fix\" the undefined expressions I started this answer by presenting.\nIn the case of printf(\"%d %d %d\\n\", x, ++x, x++);, it's easy \u2014 just write it as three separate printf calls:\nprintf(\"%d \", x);\nprintf(\"%d \", ++x);\nprintf(\"%d\\n\", x++);\n\nNow the behavior is perfectly well defined, and you'll get sensible results.\nIn the case of x = x++ + ++x, on the other hand, there's no way to fix it.  There's no way to write it so that it has guaranteed behavior matching your expectations \u2014 but that's okay, because you would never write an expression like x = x++ + ++x in a real program anyway.\n","target":0,"question":"Interfaces vs Types in TypeScript\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main(void)\n{\n   int i = 0;\n   i = i++ + ++i;\n   printf(\"%d\\n\", i); \/\/ 3\n\n   i = 1;\n   i = (i++);\n   printf(\"%d\\n\", i); \/\/ 2 Should be 1, no ?\n\n   volatile int u = 0;\n   u = u++ + ++u;\n   printf(\"%d\\n\", u); \/\/ 1\n\n   u = 1;\n   u = (u++);\n   printf(\"%d\\n\", u); \/\/ 2 Should also be one, no ?\n\n   register int v = 0;\n   v = v++ + ++v;\n   printf(\"%d\\n\", v); \/\/ 3 (Should be the same as u ?)\n\n   int w = 0;\n   printf(\"%d %d\\n\", ++w, w); \/\/ shouldn't this print 1 1\n\n   int x[2] = { 5, 8 }, y = 0;\n   x[y] = y ++;\n   printf(\"%d %d\\n\", x[0], x[1]); \/\/ shouldn't this print 0 8? or 5 0?\n}\n\n"}

{"question_id":354070,"answer":"To add onto Joel Coehoorn's response, I'll add some sqlite-specific optimization info (other SQL flavors may behave differently). In the original example, the LEFT JOINs have a different outcome depending on whether you use JOIN ON ... WHERE or JOIN ON ... AND. Here is a slightly modified example to illustrate:\nSELECT *\nFROM Orders\nLEFT JOIN OrderLines ON Orders.ID = OrderLines.OrderID\n    WHERE Orders.Username = OrderLines.Username\n\nversus\nSELECT *\nFROM Orders\nLEFT JOIN OrderLines ON Orders.ID = OrderLines.OrderID \n    AND Orders.Username = OrderLines.Username\n\nNow, the original answer states that if you use a plain inner join instead of a left join, the outcome of both queries will be the same, but the execution plan will differ. I recently realized that the semantic difference between the two is that the former forces the query optimizer to use the index associated with the ON clause, while the latter allows the optimizer to choose any index within the ON ... AND clauses, depending on what it thinks will work best.\nOccasionally, the optimizer will guess wrong and you'll want to force a certain execution plan. In this case, let's say that the SQLite optimizer wrongly concludes that the fastest way to perform this join would be to use the index on Orders.Username, when you know from empirical testing that the index on Orders.ID would deliver your query faster.\nIn this case, the former JOIN ON ... WHERE syntax essentially allows you to force the primary join operation to occur on the ID parameter, with secondary filtering on Username performed only after the main join is complete. In contrast, the JOIN ON ... AND syntax allows the optimizer to pick whether to use the index on Orders.ID or Orders.Username, and there is the theoretical possibility that it picks the one that ends up slower.\n","target":0,"question":"Throw away local commits in Git\n\nAfter reading it, this is not a duplicate of Explicit vs Implicit SQL Joins.\nThe answer may be related (or even the same) but the question is different.\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference and what should go in each?\n\nIf I understand the theory correctly, the query optimizer should be able to use both interchangeably.\n"}

{"question_id":15336248,"answer":"EF Core 7.0 new feature: ExecuteUpdate\nFinally! After a long wait, EF Core 7.0 now has a natively supported way to run UPDATE (and also DELETE) statements while also allowing you to use arbitrary LINQ queries (.Where(u => ...)), without having to first retrieve the relevant entities from the database: The new built-in method called ExecuteUpdate \u2014 see \"What's new in EF Core 7.0?\".\nExecuteUpdate is precisely meant for these kinds of scenarios, it can operate on any IQueryable instance, and lets you update specific columns on any number of rows, while always issuing a single UPDATE statement behind the scenes, making it as efficient as possible.\nUsage:\nImagine you want to update a specific user's email and display name:\ndbContext.Users\n    .Where(u => u.Id == someId)\n    .ExecuteUpdate(b => b\n        .SetProperty(u => u.Email, \"NewEmail@gmail.com\")\n        .SetProperty(u => u.DisplayName, \"New Display Name\")\n    );\n\nAs you can see, ExecuteUpdate requires you to make one or more calls to the SetProperty method, to specify which property to update, and also what new value to assign to it.\nEF Core will translate this into the following UPDATE statement:\nUPDATE [u]\n    SET [u].[Email] = \"NewEmail@gmail.com\",\n    [u].[DisplayName] = \"New Display Name\"\nFROM [Users] AS [u]\nWHERE [u].[Id] = someId\n\nAlso, ExecuteDelete for deleting rows:\nThere's also a counterpart to ExecuteUpdate called ExecuteDelete, which, as the name implies, can be used to delete a single or multiple rows at once without first fetching them.\nUsage:\n\/\/ Delete users that haven't been active in 2022:\ndbContext.Users\n    .Where(u => u.LastActiveAt.Year < 2022)\n    .ExecuteDelete();\n\nSimilar to ExecuteUpdate, ExecuteDelete will generate DELETE SQL statements behind the scenes \u2014 in this case, the following one:\nDELETE FROM [u]\nFROM [Users] AS [u]\nWHERE DATEPART(year, [u].[LastActiveAt]) < 2022\n\n\nOther notes:\n\nKeep in mind that both ExecuteUpdate and ExecuteDelete are \"terminating\", meaning that the update\/delete operation will take place as soon as you call the method. You're not supposed to call dbContext.SaveChanges() afterwards.\nIf you're curious about the SetProperty method, and you're confused as to why ExectueUpdate doesn't instead receive a member initialization expression (e.g. .ExecuteUpdate(new User { Email = \"...\" }), then refer to this comment (and the surrounding ones) on the GitHub issue for this feature.\nFurthermore, if you're curious about the rationale behind the naming, and why the prefix Execute was picked (there were also other candidates), refer to this comment, and the preceding (rather long) conversation.\nBoth methods also have async equivalents, named ExecuteUpdateAsync, and ExecuteDeleteAsync respectively.\n\n","target":0,"question":"How to check if a column exists in a SQL Server table\n\nI have been exploring different methods of editing\/updating a record within Entity Framework 5 in an ASP.NET MVC3 environment, but so far none of them tick all of the boxes I need.

{"question_id":23667086,"answer":"The short answer is : asynchronicity.\nWhy asynchronous is needed?\nJavaScript is single-threaded, meaning that two bits of the script cannot run at the same time; they have to run one after another. In browsers, JavaScript shares a thread with a load of other stuff that differs from browser to browser. But typically JavaScript is in the same queue as painting, updating styles, and handling user actions (such as highlighting text and interacting with form controls). Activity in one of these things delays the others.\nYou've probably used events and callbacks to get around this. Here are events:\n\r\n\r\nvar img1 = document.querySelector('.img-1');\n\nimg1.addEventListener('load', function() {\n  \/\/ image loaded\n  console.log(\"Loaded\");\n});\n\nimg1.addEventListener('error', function() {\n  \/\/ error caught\n  console.log(\"Error printed\");\n});\r\n<img class=\"img-1\" src=\"#\" alt=\"img\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\nThis isn't sneezy at all. We get the image, add a couple of listeners, then JavaScript can stop executing until one of those listeners is called.\nUnfortunately, in the example above, it's possible that the events happened before we started listening for them, so we need to work around that using the \"complete\" property of images:\n\r\n\r\nvar img1 = document.querySelector('.img-1');\n\nfunction loaded() {\n  \/\/ image loaded\n  console.log(\"Loaded\");\n}\n\nif (img1.complete) {\n  loaded();\n} else {\n  img1.addEventListener('load', loaded);\n}\n\nimg1.addEventListener('error', function() {\n  \/\/ error caught\n  console.log(\"Error printed\");\n});\r\n<img class=\"img-1\" src=\"#\" alt=\"img\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\nThis doesn't catch images that errored before we got a chance to listen for them; unfortunately, the DOM doesn't give us a way to do that. Also, this is loading one image. Things get even more complex if we want to know when a set of images have loaded.\nEvents aren't always the best way\nEvents are great for things that can happen multiple times on the same object\u2014 keyup, touchstart etc. With those events, you don't really care about what happened before you attached the listener.\nThe two main ways to do it correctly: are callbacks and promises.\nCallbacks\nCallbacks are functions that are passed inside the arguments of other functions, this procedure is valid in JavaScript because functions are objects and objects can be passed as arguments to functions. The basic structure of the callback function looks something like this:\n\r\n\r\nfunction getMessage(callback) {\n  callback();\n}\n\nfunction showMessage() {\n  console.log(\"Hello world! I am a callback\");\n}\ngetMessage(showMessage);\r\n\r\n\r\n\nPromise\nAlthough there are ways to keep the callback hell at bay with vanilla JS, promises are growing in popularity and are currently being standardized in ES6 (see Promise).\nA promise is a placeholder representing the eventual result (value) of an asynchronous operation\n\nthe promise placeholder will be replaced by the result value (if successful) or reason for failure (if unsuccessful)\n\nIf you don't need to know when something happened, but just whether it happened or not, then a promise is what you are looking for.\nA promise is a bit like an event listener, except that:\n\na promise can only succeed or fail once\na promise can't switch from fail to success, or vice versa\nonce you have a result, the promise is immutable\nif a promise has succeeded or failed, and you later add a success\/failure callback, the correct callback will be called\nit doesn't matter that the event occurred before you added the callback\n\nNote: Always return a result from a function inside a Promise, otherwise there's nothing for the subsequent function to act on.\nPromise Terminology\nA promise can be:\n\nfulfilled: The action relating to the promise succeeded\n\nthe asynchronous operation has completed\nthe promise has a value\nthe promise will not change again\n\n\nrejected: The action relating to the promise failed\n\nthe asynchronous operation failed\nthe promise will never be fulfilled\nthe promise has a reason indicating why the operation failed\nthe promise will not change again\n\n\npending: Hasn't fulfilled or rejected yet\n\nthe asynchronous operation hasn't been completed yet\ncan transition to fulfilled or rejected\n\n\nsettled: Has been fulfilled or rejected and is thus immutable\n\nHow to Create a Promise\n\r\n\r\nfunction getMessage() {\n  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n    setTimeout(function() {\n      resolve('Hello world! I am a promise');\n    }, 0);\n  });\n}\n\ngetMessage().then(function(message) {\n  console.log(message);\n});\r\n\r\n\r\n\n","target":0,"question":"Loop through an array of strings in Bash?\n\nGiven the following examples, why is outerScopeVar undefined in all cases?\nvar outerScopeVar;\n\nvar img = document.createElement('img');\nimg.onload = function() {\n    outerScopeVar = this.width;\n};\nimg.src = 'lolcat.png';\nalert(outerScopeVar);\n\n\nvar outerScopeVar;\nsetTimeout(function() {\n    outerScopeVar = 'Hello Asynchronous World!';\n}, 0);\nalert(outerScopeVar);\n\n\n\/\/ Example using some jQuery\nvar outerScopeVar;\n$.post('loldog', function(response) {\n    outerScopeVar = response;\n});\nalert(outerScopeVar);\n\n\n\/\/ Node.js example\nvar outerScopeVar;\nfs.readFile('.\/catdog.html', function(err, data) {\n    outerScopeVar = data;\n});\nconsole.log(outerScopeVar);\n\n\n\/\/ with promises\nvar outerScopeVar;\nmyPromise.then(function (response) {\n    outerScopeVar = response;\n});\nconsole.log(outerScopeVar);\n\n\n\/\/ with observables\nvar outerScopeVar;\nmyObservable.subscribe(function (value) {\n    outerScopeVar = value;\n});\nconsole.log(outerScopeVar);\n\n\n\/\/ geolocation API\nvar outerScopeVar;\nnavigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(function (pos) {\n    outerScopeVar = pos;\n});\nconsole.log(outerScopeVar);\n\nWhy does it output undefined in all of these examples?

{"question_id":20148,"answer":"The Question and most of the Answers are out of date.\n\nYes, it is an old wives' tale that MyISAM is faster than InnoDB.  notice the Question's date:  2008; it is now almost a decade later.  InnoDB has made significant performance strides since then.\n\nThe dramatic graph was for the one case where MyISAM wins: COUNT(*) without a WHERE clause.  But is that really what you spend your time doing?\n\nIf you run concurrency test, InnoDB is very likely to win, even against MEMORY.\n\nIf you do any writes while benchmarking SELECTs, MyISAM and MEMORY are likely to lose because of table-level locking.\n\nIn fact, Oracle is so sure that InnoDB is better that they have all but removed MyISAM from 8.0.\n\nThe Question was written early in the days of 5.1.

The reads can be dirty (e.g. I don't need 100% accurate information at the time of read).\nThe task in question will be doing over 1 million database transactions an hour.  \n\nI've read a bunch of stuff on the web about the differences between MyISAM and InnoDB, and MyISAM seems like the obvious choice to me for the particular database\/tables that I'll be using for this task.  From what I seem to be reading, InnoDB is good if transactions are needed since row level locking is supported.\n\nDoes anybody have any experience with this type of load (or higher)?

{"question_id":21435339,"answer":"Reading Hadley and Arun's answers one gets the impression that those who prefer dplyr's syntax would have in some cases to switch over to data.table or compromise for long running times.\nBut as some have already mentioned, dplyr can use data.table as a backend. This is accomplished using the dtplyr package which recently had it's version 1.0.0 release. Learning dtplyr incurs practically zero additional effort.\nWhen using dtplyr one uses the function lazy_dt() to declare a lazy data.table, after which standard dplyr syntax is used to specify operations on it. This would look something like the following:\nnew_table <- mtcars2 %>% \n  lazy_dt() %>%\n  filter(wt < 5) %>% \n  mutate(l100k = 235.21 \/ mpg) %>% # liters \/ 100 km\n  group_by(cyl) %>% \n  summarise(l100k = mean(l100k))\n\n  new_table\n\n#> Source: local data table [?? x 2]\n#> Call:   `_DT1`[wt < 5][, `:=`(l100k = 235.21\/mpg)][, .(l100k = mean(l100k)), \n#>     keyby = .(cyl)]\n#> \n#>     cyl l100k\n#>   <dbl> <dbl>\n#> 1     4  9.05\n#> 2     6 12.0 \n#> 3     8 14.9 \n#> \n#> # Use as.data.table()\/as.data.frame()\/as_tibble() to access results\n\nThe new_table object is not evaluated until calling on it as.data.table()\/as.data.frame()\/as_tibble() at which point the underlying data.table operation is executed.\nI've recreated a benchmark analysis done by data.table author Matt Dowle back at December 2018 which covers the case of operations over large numbers of groups. I've found that dtplyr indeed enables for the most part those who prefer the dplyr syntax to keep using it while enjoying the speed offered by data.table.\n","target":0,"question":"Is there a way to cache https credentials for pushing commits?\n\nOverview\n\nI'm relatively familiar with data.table, not so much with dplyr.  I've read through some dplyr vignettes and examples that have popped up on SO, and so far my conclusions are that:\n\n\ndata.table and dplyr are comparable in speed, except when there are many (i.e. >10-100K) groups, and in some other circumstances (see benchmarks below)\ndplyr has more accessible syntax\ndplyr abstracts (or will) potential DB interactions\nThere are some minor functionality differences (see \"Examples\/Usage\" below)\n\n\nIn my mind 2. doesn't bear much weight because I am fairly familiar with it data.table, though I understand that for users new to both it will be a big factor.  I would like to avoid an argument about which is more intuitive, as that is irrelevant for my specific question asked from the perspective of someone already familiar with data.table.  I also would like to avoid a discussion about how \"more intuitive\" leads to faster analysis (certainly true, but again, not what I'm most interested about here).\n\nQuestion\n\nWhat I want to know is:\n\n\nAre there analytical tasks that are a lot easier to code with one or the other package for people familiar with the packages (i.e. some combination of keystrokes required vs. required level of esotericism, where less of each is a good thing).\nAre there analytical tasks that are performed substantially (i.e. more than 2x) more efficiently in one package vs. another.\n\n\nOne recent SO question got me thinking about this a bit more, because up until that point I didn't think dplyr would offer much beyond what I can already do in data.table.  Here is the dplyr solution (data at end of Q):\n\ndat %.%\n  group_by(name, job) %.%\n  filter(job != \"Boss\" | year == min(year)) %.%\n  mutate(cumu_job2 = cumsum(job2))\n\n\nWhich was much better than my hack attempt at a data.table solution.  That said, good data.table solutions are also pretty good (thanks Jean-Robert, Arun, and note here I favored single statement over the strictly most optimal solution):\n\nsetDT(dat)[,\n  .SD[job != \"Boss\" | year == min(year)][, cumjob := cumsum(job2)], \n  by=list(id, job)\n]\n\n\nThe syntax for the latter may seem very esoteric, but it actually is pretty straightforward if you're used to data.table (i.e. doesn't use some of the more esoteric tricks).\n\nIdeally what I'd like to see is some good examples were the dplyr or data.table way is substantially more concise or performs substantially better.\n\nExamples\n\nUsage\n\n\ndplyr does not allow grouped operations that return arbitrary number of rows (from eddi's question, note: this looks like it will be implemented in dplyr 0.5, also, @beginneR shows a potential work-around using do in the answer to @eddi's question).\ndata.table supports rolling joins (thanks @dholstius) as well as overlap joins\ndata.table internally optimises expressions of the form DT[col == value] or DT[col %in% values] for speed through automatic indexing which uses binary search while using the same base R syntax. See here for some more details and a tiny benchmark.\ndplyr offers standard evaluation versions of functions (e.g. regroup, summarize_each_) that can simplify the programmatic use of dplyr (note programmatic use of data.table is definitely possible, just requires some careful thought, substitution\/quoting, etc, at least to my knowledge)\n\n\nBenchmarks\n\n\nI ran my own benchmarks and found both packages to be comparable in \"split apply combine\" style analysis, except when there are very large numbers of groups (>100K) at which point data.table becomes substantially faster.\n@Arun ran some benchmarks on joins, showing that data.table scales better than dplyr as the number of groups increase (updated with recent enhancements in both packages and recent version of R).  Also, a benchmark when trying to get unique values has data.table ~6x faster.\n(Unverified) has data.table 75% faster on larger versions of a group\/apply\/sort while dplyr was 40% faster on the smaller ones (another SO question from comments, thanks danas).\nMatt, the main author of data.table, has benchmarked grouping operations on data.table, dplyr and python pandas on up to 2 billion rows (~100GB in RAM).\nAn older benchmark on 80K groups has data.table ~8x faster\n\n\nData\n\nThis is for the first example I showed in the question section.\n\ndat <- structure(list(id = c(1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 2L, 2L, \n2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L), name = c(\"Jane\", \"Jane\", \"Jane\", \"Jane\", \n\"Jane\", \"Jane\", \"Jane\", \"Jane\", \"Bob\", \"Bob\", \"Bob\", \"Bob\", \"Bob\", \n\"Bob\", \"Bob\", \"Bob\"), year = c(1980L, 1981L, 1982L, 1983L, 1984L, \n1985L, 1986L, 1987L, 1985L, 1986L, 1987L, 1988L, 1989L, 1990L, \n1991L, 1992L), job = c(\"Manager\", \"Manager\", \"Manager\", \"Manager\", \n\"Manager\", \"Manager\", \"Boss\", \"Boss\", \"Manager\", \"Manager\", \"Manager\", \n\"Boss\", \"Boss\", \"Boss\", \"Boss\", \"Boss\"), job2 = c(1L, 1L, 1L, \n1L, 1L, 1L, 0L, 0L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 0L)), .Names = c(\"id\", \n\"name\", \"year\", \"job\", \"job2\"), class = \"data.frame\", row.names = c(NA, \n-16L))\n\n"}

If MandatoryRelease is None then that planned feature is dropped.\nCompilerFlag is the (bitfield) flag that should be passed in the fourth argument to the built-in function compile() to enable the feature in dynamically compiled code.

{"question_id":3870088,"answer":"The answers here do an excellent job in defining both monoids and monads, however, they still don't seem to answer the question:\n\n\n  And on a less important note, is this true and if so could you give an explanation (hopefully one that can be understood by someone who doesn't have much Haskell experience)?\n\n\nThe crux of the matter that is missing here, is the different notion of \"monoid\", the so-called categorification more precisely  -- the one of monoid in a monoidal category. Sadly Mac Lane's book itself makes it very confusing:\n\n\n  All told, a monad in X is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors of X, with product \u00d7 replaced by composition of endofunctors and unit set by the identity endofunctor.\n\n\nMain confusion\n\nWhy is this confusing? Because it does not define what is \"monoid in the category of endofunctors\" of X. Instead, this sentence suggests taking a monoid inside the set of all endofunctors together with the functor composition as binary operation and the identity functor as a monoidal unit. Which works perfectly fine and turns into a monoid any subset of endofunctors that contains the identity functor and is closed under functor composition.\n\nYet this is not the correct interpretation, which the book fails to make clear at that stage. A Monad f is a fixed endofunctor, not a subset of endofunctors closed under composition. A common construction is to use f to generate a monoid by taking the set of all k-fold compositions f^k = f(f(...)) of f with itself, including k=0 that corresponds to the identity f^0 = id. And now the set S of all these powers for all k>=0 is indeed a monoid \"with product \u00d7 replaced by composition of endofunctors and unit set by the identity endofunctor\". \n\nAnd yet:\n\n\nThis monoid S can be defined for any functor f or even literally for any self-map of X. It is the monoid generated by f.\nThe monoidal structure of S given by the functor composition and the identity functor has nothing do with f being or not being a monad.\n\n\nAnd to make things more confusing, the definition of \"monoid in monoidal category\" comes later in the book as you can see from the table of contents. And yet understanding this notion is absolutely critical to understanding the connection with monads.\n\n(Strict) monoidal categories\n\nGoing to Chapter VII on Monoids (which comes later than Chapter VI on Monads), we find the definition of the so-called strict monoidal category as triple (B, *, e), where B is a category, *: B x B-> B a bifunctor (functor with respect to each component with other component fixed) and e is a unit object in B, satisfying the associativity and unit laws: \n\n(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)\na * e = e * a = a\n\n\nfor any objects a,b,c of B, and the same identities for any morphisms a,b,c with e replaced by id_e, the identity morphism of e. It is now instructive to observe that in our case of interest, where B is the category of endofunctors of X with natural transformations as morphisms, * the functor composition and e the identity functor, all these laws are satisfied, as can be directly verified.\n\nWhat comes after in the book is the definition of the \"relaxed\" monoidal category, where the laws only hold modulo some fixed natural transformations satisfying so-called coherence relations, which is however not important for our cases of the endofunctor categories.\n\nMonoids in monoidal categories\n\nFinally, in section 3 \"Monoids\" of Chapter VII, the actual definition is given:\n\n\n  A monoid c in a monoidal category (B, *, e) is an object of B with two arrows (morphisms) \n\n\nmu: c * c -> c\nnu: e -> c\n\n\nmaking 3 diagrams commutative. Recall that in our case, these are morphisms in the category of endofunctors, which are natural transformations corresponding to precisely join and return for a monad. The connection becomes even clearer when we make the composition * more explicit, replacing c * c by c^2, where c is our monad.\n\nFinally, notice that the 3 commutative diagrams (in the definition of a monoid in monoidal category) are written for general (non-strict) monoidal categories, while in our case all natural transformations arising as part of the monoidal category are actually identities. That will make the diagrams exactly the same as the ones in the definition of a monad, making the correspondence complete.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, any monad is by definition an endofunctor, hence an object in the category of endofunctors, where the monadic join and return operators satisfy the definition of a monoid in that particular (strict) monoidal category. Vice versa, any monoid in the monoidal category of endofunctors is by definition a triple (c, mu, nu) consisting of an object and two arrows, e.g. natural transformations in our case, satisfying the same laws as a monad.\n\nFinally, note the key difference between the (classical) monoids and the more general monoids in monoidal categories. The two arrows mu and nu above are not anymore a binary operation and a unit in a set. Instead, you have one fixed endofunctor c. The functor composition * and the identity functor alone do not provide the complete structure needed for the monad, despite that confusing remark in the book. \n\nAnother approach would be to compare with the standard monoid C of all self-maps of a set A, where the binary operation is the composition, that can be seen to map the standard cartesian product C x C into C. Passing to the categorified monoid, we are replacing the cartesian product x with the functor composition *, and the binary operation gets replaced with the natural transformation mu from \nc * c to c, that is a collection of the join operators \n\njoin: c(c(T))->c(T)\n\n\nfor every object T (type in programming). And the identity elements in classical monoids, which can be identified with images of maps from a fixed one-point-set, get replaced with the collection of the return operators \n\nreturn: T->c(T) \n\n\nBut now there are no more cartesian products, so no pairs of elements and thus no binary operations.\n","target":0,"question":"What is move semantics?\n\nWho first said the following?\n\n\n  A monad is just a monoid in the\n  category of endofunctors, what's the\n  problem?\n\n\nAnd on a less important note, is this true and if so could you give an explanation (hopefully one that can be understood by someone who doesn't have much Haskell experience)?\n"}

{"question_id":40801772,"answer":"Ports\nThe ports section will publish ports on the host. Docker will set up a forward for a specific port from the host network into the container. By default, this is implemented with a userspace proxy process (docker-proxy) that listens on the first port, and forwards into the container, which needs to listen on the second point. If the container is not listening on the destination port, you will still see something listening on the host, but get a connection refused if you try to connect to that host port, from the failed forward into your container.\nNote, the container must be listening on all network interfaces since this proxy is not running within the container's network namespace and cannot reach 127.0.0.1 inside the container. The IPv4 method for that is to configure your application to listen on 0.0.0.0.\nAlso note that published ports do not work in the opposite direction. You cannot connect to a service on the host from the container by publishing a port. Instead you'll find docker errors trying to listen to the already-in-use host port.\nExpose\nExpose is documentation. It sets metadata on the image, and when running, on the container too. Typically, you configure this in the Dockerfile with the EXPOSE instruction, and it serves as documentation for the users running your image, for them to know on which ports by default your application will be listening. When configured with a compose file, this metadata is only set on the container. You can see the exposed ports when you run a docker inspect on the image or container.\nThere are a few tools that rely on exposed ports. In docker, the -P flag will publish all exposed ports onto ephemeral ports on the host. There are also various reverse proxies that will default to using an exposed port when sending traffic to your application if you do not explicitly set the container port.\nOther than those external tools, expose has no impact at all on the networking between containers. You only need a common docker network, and connecting to the container port, to access one container from another. If that network is user created (e.g. not the default bridge network named bridge), you can use DNS to connect to the other containers.\n","target":0,"question":"How do I break out of nested loops in Java?\n\nWhat is the difference between ports and expose options in docker-compose.yml?\n"}

{"question_id":936197,"answer":"IBM makes a really nice comparison between the two:\n\nBy strict definition, a web server is a common subset of an application server.\nA web server delivers static web content\u2014e.g., HTML pages, files, images, video\u2014primarily in response to hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) requests from a web browser.\nAn application server typically can deliver web content too, but its primary job is to enable interaction between end-user clients and server-side application code\u2014the code representing what is often called business logic\u2014to generate and deliver dynamic content, such as transaction results, decision support, or real-time analytics. The client for an application server can be the application\u2019s own end-user UI, a web browser, or a mobile app, and the client-server interaction can occur via any number of communication protocols.\nIn practice, however, the line between web servers and application servers has become fuzzier, particularly as the web browser has emerged as the application client of choice and as user expectations of web applications and web application performance have grown.\nMost web servers support plug-ins for scripting languages (e.g., ASP, JSP, PHP, Perl) that enable the web server to generate dynamic content based on server-side logic. And an increasing number of application servers not only incorporate web server capabilities, but use HTTP as their primary protocol and support other protocols (e.g., CGI and CGI variants) for interfacing with web servers. They also allow web applications to leverage services like reverse proxy, clustering, redundancy, and load balancing\u2014services that improve performance and reliability and allow developers to focus less on infrastructure and more on coding.\nTo make matters more confusing, many web servers and some application servers are referred to, or refer to themselves, as web application servers.\nThe bottom line is that today\u2019s most popular web servers and application servers are hybrids of both.

{"question_id":2723397,"answer":"PECS: Producer extends and Consumer super\nPrerequisites for understanding:\n\nGenerics and generic wildcards\nPolymorphism, Subtyping and Supertyping\n\n\nLets say we have a type which takes a generic type parameter T, for example List<T>. When we write code it can be potentially beneficial to also allow subtypes or supertypes of our generic type parameter T. This relaxes the restraints for the user of the API and can make the code more flexible.\nLet first see what we gain relaxing these restrictions. Lets say we have the following 3 classes:\nclass BaseAnimal{};\n\nclass Animal extends BaseAnimal{};\n\nclass Duck extends Animal{};\n\nand we are building a public method which takes a list<Animal>\n\nIf we use a super List<? super Animal> instead of List<Animal> we now can pass in more lists to satisfy the requirement of our method. We now can pass in either List<Animal> or List<BaseAnimal> even List<Object>\nIf we use an extends List<? extends Animal> instead of List<Animal> we now can pass in more lists to satisfy the requirement of our method. We now can pass in either List<Animal> or List<Duck>\n\nHowever this poses the following 2 restrictions:\n\nIf we use a super type like List<? super Animal> we don't know the exact type of List<T> it will be. It could be either a list of List<Animal> or List<BaseAnimal> or List<Object>. We have no way of knowing. This means we can never get a value out of this List because we do not know what the type will be. However we can put any data type which is Animal or extends it into the List. Because we can only put data into the  List it is called a consumer of data.\nIf we use an extends List<? extends Animal> instead of List<Animal>. We also don't know what the exact type is.

{"question_id":1065435,"answer":"You can use the converse approach to achieve the same result - start from the composite and then remove styling using the unset keyword. For example, if you start with the following sample composition:\n.composite {\n    color: red;\n    margin-left: 50px;\n    background-color: green\n}\n\nyou can then increase selector specificity to selectively remove styles using unset:\n.composite.no-color {\n    color: unset\n}\n\n.composite.no-margin-left {\n    margin-left: unset\n}\n\n.composite.no-background-color {\n    background-color: unset\n}\n\nHere is a JSFiddle demonstrating this approach.\nOne benefit of this approach is that because the specificity of the compound selectors is higher than the composite itself, you do not need all of the combinations of classes to achieve the desired results for multiple combinations:\n\/* Multi-unset compound selector combinations, such as the one that follows, ARE NOT NECESSARY because of the higher specificity of each individual compound selectors listed above.

If you have functions f:optional<A>->optional<B>, g:optional<B>->optional<C>,h:optional<C>->optional<D>. Then you could compose them\noptional<A> opt;\nh(g(f(opt)));\n\nThe benefit of monad types, is that you can instead compose f:A->optional<B>, g:B->optional<C>,h:C->optional<D>. They can do this because the monadic interface provides the bind operator\nauto optional<A>::bind(A->optional<B>)->optional<B>\n\nand the composition could be written\noptional<A> opt\nopt.bind(f)\n   .bind(g)\n   .bind(h)\n\nThe benefit of monads is that we no longer have to handle the logic of if(!opt) return nullopt; in each of f,g,h because this logic is moved into the bind operator.\nranges\/lists\/iterables are the second most fundamental monad type.\nThe monadic feature of ranges is we can transform then flatten i.e. Starting with a sentance enncoded as a range of integers [36, 98]\nwe can transform to [['m','a','c','h','i','n','e',' '], ['l','e','a','r','n','i','n','g', '.']]\nand then flatten ['m','a','c','h','i','n','e', ' ', 'l','e','a','r','n','i','n','g','.']\nInstead of writing this code\nvector<string> lookup_table;\nauto stringify(vector<unsigned> rng) -> vector<char>\n{\n    vector<char> result;\n    for(unsigned key : rng)\n       for(char ch : lookup_table[key])\n           result.push_back(ch);\n       result.push_back(' ')\n    result.push_back('.')\n    return result\n}\n\nwe could write write this\nauto f(unsigned key) -> vector<char>\n{\n    vector<char> result;\n    for(ch : lookup_table[key])\n        result.push_back(ch);\n    return result\n}\nauto stringify(vector<unsigned> rng) -> vector<char>\n{\n    return rng.bind(f);\n}\n\nThe monad pushes the for loop for(unsigned key : rng) up into the bind function, allowing for code that is easier to reason about, theoretically. Pythagorean triples can be generated in range-v3 with nested binds (rather than chained binds as we saw with optional)\nauto triples =\n  for_each(ints(1), [](int z) {\n    return for_each(ints(1, z), [=](int x) {\n      return for_each(ints(x, z), [=](int y) {\n        return yield_if(x*x + y*y == z*z, std::make_tuple(x, y, z));\n      });\n    });\n  });\n\n","target":0,"question":"Why does this code using random strings print \"hello world\"?\n\nIn terms that an OOP programmer would understand (without any functional programming background), what is a monad?\nWhat problem does it solve and what are the most common places it's used?\nUpdate\nTo clarify the kind of understanding I was looking for, let\u2019s say you were converting an FP application that had monads into an OOP application.

{"question_id":148901,"answer":"It seems that the safest way - to deal with all \\ any falsy types of supplied arguments before deciding to use the default - is to check for the existence\\presence of the optional argument in the invoked function. \n\nRelying on the arguments object member creation which doesn't even get created if the argument is missing, regardless of the fact that it might be declared, we can write your function like this:\n\n  function myFunc(requiredArg, optionalArg){\n        optionalArg = 1 in arguments ? optionalArg : 'defaultValue';\n  \/\/do stuff\n  }\n\n\nUtilizing this behavior: \nWe can safely check for any missing values on arguments list arbitrarily and explicitly whenever we need to make sure the function gets a certain value required in its procedure. \n\nIn the following demo code we will deliberately put a typeless and valueless undefined as a default value to be able to determine whether it might fail on falsy argument values, such as 0 false etc., or if it behaves as expected.\n\nfunction argCheck( arg1, arg2, arg3 ){\n\n       arg1 = 0 in arguments || undefined;\n       arg2 = 1 in arguments || false;\n       arg3 = 2 in arguments || 0;\n   var arg4 = 3 in arguments || null;\n\n   console.log( arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4 ) \n}\n\n\nNow, checking few falsy argument-values to see if their presence is correctly detected and therefore evaluates to true:\n\nargCheck( \"\", 0, false, null );\n>> true true true true\n\n\nWhich means -they didn't fail the recognition of\/as expected argument values.\nHere we have a check with all arguments missing, which according to our algo should acquire their default values even if they're falsy.\n\nargCheck( );\n>> undefined false 0 null\n\n\nAs we can see, the arguments arg1, arg2, arg3 and the undeclared arg4, are returning their exact default values, as ordered. \nBecause we've now made sure that it works, we can rewrite the function which will actually be able to use them as in the first example by using: either if or a ternary condition.\n\nOn functions that have more than one optional argument, - a loop through, might have saved us some bits. But since argument names don't get initialized if their values are not supplied, we cannot access them by names anymore even if we've programmatically written a default value, we can only access them by arguments[index] which useless code readability wise.\n\nBut aside from this inconvenience, which in certain coding situations might be fully acceptable, there's another unaccounted problem for multiple and arbitrary number of argument defaults. Which may and should be considered a bug, as we can no longer skip arguments, as we once might have been able to, without giving a value, in a syntax such as:\n\nargCheck(\"a\",,22,{});\n\n\nbecause it will throw! Which makes it impossible for us to substitute our argument with a specific falsy type of our desired default value.\nWhich is stupid, since the arguments object is an array-like object and is expected to support this syntax and convention as is, natively or by default!\n\nBecause of this shortsighted decision we can no longer hope to write a function like this:\n\nfunction argCheck( ) {\n    var _default = [undefined, 0, false, null ],\n        _arg = arguments;\n\n for( var x in _default ) {\n         x in _arg ? 1 : _arg[x] = _default[x];\n        }\n    console.log( _arg[0],_arg[1],_arg[2],_arg[3] );\n}\n\n\nin which case, we would be able to write each default value of a desired type in arguments row and be able to at least access them by args.index.\n\nFor instance this function call would yield:\n\nargCheck();\n>>undefined 0 false null\n\n\nas defined in our default array of arguments values.\nHowever the following is still possible:\n\nargCheck({})\n>>Object {  } 0 false null\n\nargCheck({}, [])\n>>Object {  } Array [  ] false null\n\n\nBut regretfully not:\n\n argCheck(\"a\",,,22);\n >>SyntaxError: expected expression, got ','\n\n\nWhich would otherwise be logging:\n\n>>a 0 false 22\n\n\nbut that's in a better world!\nHowever - for the original question - the topmost function will do just fine.\ne.g.:\n\nfunction argCheck( arg, opt ) {\n         1 in arguments ? 1 : opt = \"default\";\n         console.log( arg, opt );\n}\n\n\np.s.: sorry for not preserving the types of chosen defaults in my argument inputs while writing them. \n","target":0,"question":"Transitions on the CSS display property\n\nI've always handled optional parameters in JavaScript like this:\n\nfunction myFunc(requiredArg, optionalArg){\n  optionalArg = optionalArg || 'defaultValue';\n\n  \/\/ Do stuff\n}\n\n\nIs there a better way to do it?\n\nAre there any cases where using || like that is going to fail?\n"}

{"question_id":6414,"answer":"Since the example written here are pretty simple for understanding the concept I think it's also a good idea to look at the more practical version of the continue statement being used.\nFor example:\nwe ask the user to enter 5 unique numbers if the number is already entered we give them an error and we continue our program.\nstatic void Main(string[] args)\n        {\n            var numbers = new List<int>();\n\n\n            while (numbers.Count < 5)\n            { \n            \n                Console.WriteLine(\"Enter 5 uniqe numbers:\");\n                var number = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());\n\n\n\n                if (numbers.Contains(number))\n                {\n                    Console.WriteLine(\"You have already entered\" + number);\n                    continue;\n                }\n\n\n\n                numbers.Add(number);\n            }\n\n\n            numbers.Sort();\n\n\n            foreach(var number in numbers)\n            {\n                Console.WriteLine(number);\n            }\n\n\n        }\n\nlets say the users input were 1,2,2,2,3,4,5.the result printed would be:\n1,2,3,4,5\n\nWhy? because every time user entered a number that was already on the list, our program ignored it and didn't add what's already on the list to it.\nNow if we try the same code but without continue statement and let's say with the same input from the user which was 1,2,2,2,3,4,5.\nthe output would be :\n1,2,2,2,3,4\n\nWhy? because there was no continue statement to let our program know it should ignore the already entered number.\nNow for the Break statement, again I think its the best to show by example. For example:\nHere we want our program to continuously ask the user to enter a number. We want the loop to terminate when the user types \u201cok\" and at the end Calculate the sum of all the previously entered numbers and display it on the console.\nThis is how the break statement is used in this example:\n{\n            var sum = 0;\n            while (true)\n            {\n                Console.Write(\"Enter a number (or 'ok' to exit): \");\n                var input = Console.ReadLine();\n\n                if (input.ToLower() == \"ok\")\n                    break;\n\n                sum += Convert.ToInt32(input);\n            }\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Sum of all numbers is: \" + sum);\n        }\n\nThe program will ask the user to enter a number till the user types \"OK\" and only after that, the result would be shown. Why?\nbecause break statement finished or stops the ongoing process when it has reached the condition needed.\nif there was no break statement there, the program would keep running and nothing would happen when the user typed \"ok\".\nI recommend copying this code and trying to remove or add these statements and see the changes yourself.\n","target":0,"question":"How do I get into a Docker container's shell?\n\nIn a C# (feel free to answer for other languages) loop, what's the difference between break and continue as a means to leave the structure of the loop, and go to the next iteration?\nExample:\nforeach (DataRow row in myTable.Rows)\n{\n    if (someConditionEvalsToTrue)\n    {\n        break; \/\/what's the difference between this and continue ?\n        \/\/continue;\n    }\n}\n\n"}

This typically involves organizing data in a way that takes advantage of spatial and temporal locality, which refers to the idea that data that is accessed together is likely to be stored together in memory, and that data that is accessed frequently is likely to be accessed again in the near future.\nThere are several ways to make code cache-friendly, including:\n\nUsing contiguous memory layouts: By storing data in contiguous\nblocks in memory, you can take advantage of spatial locality and\nreduce the number of cache misses.\n\nUsing arrays: Arrays are a good choice for data structures when you\nneed to access data sequentially, as they allow you to take\nadvantage of temporal locality and keep hot data in the cache.\n\nUsing pointers carefully: Pointers can be used to access data that\nis not stored contiguously in memory, but they can also lead to\ncache misses if they are used excessively. If you need to use\npointers, try to use them in a way that takes advantage of spatial\nand temporal locality to minimize cache misses.\n\nUsing compiler optimization flags: Most compilers have optimization\nflags that can be used to optimize the use of the CPU cache. These\nflags can help to minimize the number of cache misses and improve\nthe overall performance of your code.\n\n\nIt is important to note that the specific techniques that work best for optimizing the use of the CPU cache will depend on the specific requirements and constraints of your system. It may be necessary to experiment with different approaches to find the best solution for your needs.\n","target":0,"question":"Check existence of input argument in a Bash shell script\n\nWhat is the difference between \"cache unfriendly code\" and the \"cache friendly\" code?\n\nHow can I make sure I write cache-efficient code? \n"}
{"question_id":20306091,"answer":"This question needs to be reevaluated since Jetpack Compose has reached stable.\n\nJetpack Compose is Android\u2019s recommended modern toolkit for building\nnative UI.\nfrom https:\/\/developer.android.com\/jetpack\/compose\n\nThe typical jetpack-compose architecture is:\nSingle Activity, multiple composables, and glued together by jetpack navigation.\nNote there's no (need for) Fragments anymore.\nSee Now in Android for a sample.\n","target":0,"question":"Proper use of the IDisposable interface\n\nI know that Activities are designed to represent a single screen of my application, while Fragments are designed to be reusable UI layouts with logic embedded inside of them.\nUntil not long ago, I developed an application as it said that they should be developed.\nI created an Activity to represent a screen of my application and used Fragments for ViewPager or Google Maps. I rarely created a ListFragment or other UI that can be reused several times.\nRecently I stumbled on a project that contains only 2 Activities one is a SettingsActivity and other one is the MainActivity. The layout of the MainActivity is populated with many hidden full screen UI fragments and only one is shown. In the Activity logic there are many FragmentTransitions between the different screens of the application.\nWhat I like about this approach is that because the application uses an ActionBar, it stays intact and does not move with the screen switching animation, which is what happens with Activity switching. This give a more fluent feel to those screen transitions.\nSo I guess what I'm asking is to share your current development manner regarding this topic, I know it might look like an opinion based question at first look but I look at it as an Android design and architecture question... Not really an opinion based one.\nUPDATE (01.05.2014): Following this presentation by Eric Burke from Square, (which I have to say is a great presentation with a lot of useful tools for android developers. And I am not related in any way to Square)\nhttp:\/\/www.infoq.com\/presentations\/Android-Design\/\nFrom my personal experience over the past few months, I found that the best way to construct my applications is to create groups of fragments that come to represent a flow in the application and present all those fragments in one Activity. So basically you will have the same number of Activities in your application as the number of flows.\nThat way the action bar stays intact on all the flow's screens, but is being recreated on changing a flow which makes a lot of sense. As Eric Burke states and as I have come to realize as well, the philosophy of using as few Activities as possible is not applicable for all situations because it creates a mess in what he calls the \"God\" activity.\n"}

{"question_id":33054527,"answer":"Summary\nPython 2.x encouraged many bad habits WRT text handling. In particular, its type named str does not actually represent text per the Unicode standard (that type is unicode), and the default \"string literal\" in fact produces a sequence of raw bytes - with some convenience functions for treating it like a string, if you can get away with assuming a \"code page\" style encoding.\nIn 3.x, \"string literals\" now produce actual strings, and built-in functionality no longer does any implicit conversions between the two types. Thus, the same code now has a TypeError, because the literal and the variable are of incompatible types. To fix the problem, one of the values must be either replaced or converted, so that the types match.\nThe Python documentation has an extremely detailed guide to working with Unicode properly.\nIn the example in the question, the input file is processed as if it contains text. Therefore, the file should have been opened in a text mode in the first place. The only good reason the file would have been opened in binary mode even in 2.x is to avoid universal newline translation; in 3.x, this is done by specifying the newline keyword parameter when opening a file in text mode.\nTo read a file as text properly requires knowing a text encoding, which is specified in the code by (string) name. The encoding iso-8859-1 is a safe fallback; it interprets each byte separately, as representing one of the first 256 Unicode code points, in order (so it will never raise an exception due to invalid data). utf-8 is much more common as of the time of writing, but it does not accept arbitrary data. (However, in many cases, for English text, the distinction will not matter; both of those encodings, and many more, are supersets of ASCII.)\nThus:\nwith open(fname, 'r', newline='\\n', encoding='iso-8859-1') as f:\n    lines = [x.strip() for x in f.readlines()]\n\n# proceed as before\n# If the results are wrong, take additional steps to ascertain the correct encoding\n\nHow the error is created when migrating from 2.x to 3.x\nIn 2.x, 'some-pattern' creates a str, i.e. a sequence of bytes that the programmer is then likely to pretend is text. The str type is the same as the bytes type, and different from the unicode type that properly represents text. Many methods are offered to treat this data as if it were text, but it is not a proper representation of text. The meaning of each value as a text character (the encoding) is assumed. (In order to enable the illusion of raw data as \"text\", there would sometimes be implicit conversions between the str and unicode types. However, this results in confusing errors of its own - such as getting UnicodeDecodeError from an attempt to encode, or vice-versa).\nIn 3.x, 'some-pattern' creates what is also called a str; but now str means the Unicode-using, properly-text-representing string type. (unicode is no longer used as a type name, and only bytes refers to the sequence-of-bytes type.) Some changes were made to bytes to dissociate it from the text-with-assumed-encoding interpretation (in particular, indexing into a bytes object now results in an int, rather than a 1-element bytes), but many strange legacy methods persist (including ones rarely used even with actual strings any more, like zfill).\nWhy this causes a problem\nThe data, tmp, is a bytes instance. It came from a binary source: in this case, a file opened with a 'b' file mode. In other cases, it could come from a raw network socket, a web request made with urllib or similar, or some other API call.\nThis means that it cannot do anything meaningful in combination with a string. The elements of a string are Unicode code points (i.e., abstractions that represent, for the most part, text characters, in a universal form that represents all world languages and many other symbols). The elements of a bytes are, well, bytes. (Specifically in 3.x, they are interpreted as unsigned integers ranging from 0 to 255 inclusive.)\nWhen the code was migrated, the literal 'some-pattern' went from describing a bytes, to describing text. Thus, the code went from making a legal comparison (byte-sequence to byte-sequence), to making an illegal one (string to byte-sequence).\nFixing the problem\nIn order to operate on a string and a byte-sequence - whether it's checking for equality with ==, lexicographic comparison with <, substring search with in, concatenation with +, or anything else - either the string must be converted to a byte-sequence, or vice-versa. In general, only one of these will be the correct, sensible answer, and it will depend on the context.\nFixing the source\nSometimes, one of the values can be seen to be \"wrong\" in the first place. For example, if reading the file was intended to result in text, then it should have been opened in a text mode. In 3.x, the file encoding can simply be passed as an encoding keyword argument to open, and conversion to Unicode is handled seamlessly without having to feed a binary file to an explicit translation step (thus, universal newline handling still takes place seamlessly).\nIn the case of the original example, that could look like:\nwith open(fname, 'r') as f:\n    lines = [x.strip() for x in f.readlines()]\n\nThis example assumes a platform-dependent default encoding for the file. This will normally work for files that were created in straightforward ways, on the same computer. In the general case, however, the encoding of the data must be known in order to work with it properly.\nIf the encoding is known to be, for example, UTF-8, that is trivially specified:\nwith open(fname, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n    lines = [x.strip() for x in f.readlines()]\n\nSimilarly, a string literal that should have been a bytes literal is simply missing a prefix: to make the bytes sequence representing integer values [101, 120, 97, 109, 112, 108, 101] (i.e., the ASCII values of the letters example), write the bytes literal b'example', rather than the string literal `'example'). Similarly the other way around.\nIn the case of the original example, that would look like:\nif b'some-pattern' in tmp:\n\nThere is a safeguard built in to this: the bytes literal syntax only allows ASCII characters, so something like b'\u00ebx\u00e3m\u00fel\u00ea' will be caught as a SyntaxError, regardless of the encoding of the source file (since it is not clear which byte values are meant; in the old implied-encoding schemes, the ASCII range was well established, but everything else was up in the air.) Of course, bytes literals with elements representing values 128..255 can still be written by using \\x escaping for those values: for example, b'\\xebx\\xe3m\\xfel\\xea' will produce a byte-sequence corresponding to the text \u00ebx\u00e3m\u00fel\u00ea in Latin-1 (ISO 8859-1) encoding.\nConverting, when appropriate\nConversion between byte-sequences and text is only possible when an encoding has been determined. It has always been so; we just used to assume an encoding locally, and then mostly ignore that we had done so. (Programmers in places like East Asia have been more aware of the problem historically, because they commonly need to work with scripts that have more than 256 distinct symbols, and thus their text requires multi-byte encodings.)\nIn 3.x, because there is no pressure to be able to treat byte-sequences implicitly as text with an assumed encoding, there are therefore no implicit conversion steps behind the scenes. This means that understanding the API is straightforward: Bytes are raw data; therefore, they are used to encode text, which is an abstraction. Therefore, the .encode() method is provided by str (which represents text), in order to encode text into raw data. Similarly, the .decode() method is provided by bytes (which represents a byte-sequence), in order to decode raw data into text.\nApplying these to the example code, again supposing UTF-8 encoding is appropriate, gives:\nif 'some-pattern'.encode('utf-8') in tmp:\n\nand\nif 'some-pattern' in tmp.decode('utf-8'):\n\n","target":0,"question":"Calling the base constructor in C#\n\nI've very recently migrated to Python 3.5.\nThis code was working properly in Python 2.7:\nwith open(fname, 'rb') as f:\n    lines = [x.strip() for x in f.readlines()]\n\nfor line in lines:\n    tmp = line.strip().lower()\n    if 'some-pattern' in tmp: continue\n    # ... code\n\nAfter upgrading to 3.5, I'm getting the:\n\nTypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str'\n\nThe error is on the last line (the pattern search code).\nI've tried using the .decode() function on either side of the statement and also tried:\nif tmp.find('some-pattern') != -1: continue\n\n- to no avail.\nI was able to resolve almost all Python\u00a02-to-Python\u00a03  issues quickly, but this little statement was bugging me.\n"}

{"question_id":200574,"answer":"So many answers, yet ALL fail to pinpoint one very significant problem with a custom generic ForEach extension: Performance! And more specifically, memory usage and GC.\nConsider the sample below. Targeting .NET Framework 4.7.2 or .NET Core 3.1.401, configuration is Release and platform is Any CPU.\npublic static class Enumerables\n{\n    public static void ForEach<T>(this IEnumerable<T> @this, Action<T> action)\n    {\n        foreach (T item in @this)\n        {\n            action(item);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nclass Program\n{\n    private static void NoOp(int value) {}\n\n    static void Main(string[] args)\n    {\n        var list = Enumerable.Range(0, 10).ToList();\n        for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++)\n        {\n            \/\/ WithLinq(list);\n            \/\/ WithoutLinqNoGood(list);\n            WithoutLinq(list);\n        }\n    }\n\n    private static void WithoutLinq(List<int> list)\n    {\n        foreach (var item in list)\n        {\n            NoOp(item);\n        }\n    }\n\n    private static void WithLinq(IEnumerable<int> list) => list.ForEach(NoOp);\n\n    private static void WithoutLinqNoGood(IEnumerable<int> enumerable)\n    {\n        foreach (var item in enumerable)\n        {\n            NoOp(item);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nAt a first glance, all three variants should perform equally well. However, when the ForEach extension method is called many, many times, you will end up with garbage that implies a costly GC. In fact, having this ForEach extension method on a hot path has been proven to totally kill performance in our loop-intensive application.\nSimilarly, the weakly typed foreach loop will also produce garbage, but it will still be faster and less memory-intensive than the ForEach extension (which also suffers from a delegate allocation).\nStrongly typed foreach: Memory usage\n\nWeakly typed foreach: Memory usage\n\nForEach extension: Memory usage\n\nAnalysis\nFor a strongly typed foreach the compiler is able to use any optimized enumerator (e.g. value based) of a class, whereas a generic ForEach extension must fall back to a generic enumerator which will be allocated on each run. Furthermore, the actual delegate will also imply an additional allocation.\nYou would get similar bad results with the WithoutLinqNoGood method. There, the argument is of type IEnumerable<int> instead of List<int> implying the same type of enumerator allocation.\nBelow are the relevant differences in IL. A value based enumerator is certainly preferable!\nIL_0001:  callvirt   instance class\n          [mscorlib]System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerator`1<!0> \n          class [mscorlib]System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable`1<!!T>::GetEnumerator()\n\nvs\nIL_0001:  callvirt   instance valuetype\n          [mscorlib]System.Collections.Generic.List`1\/Enumerator<!0>\n          class [mscorlib]System.Collections.Generic.List`1<int32>::GetEnumerator()\n\nConclusion\nThe OP asked how to call ForEach() on an IEnumerable<T>. The original answer clearly shows how it can be done. Sure you can do it, but then again; my answer clearly shows that you shouldn't.\nVerified the same behavior when targeting .NET Core 3.1.401 (compiling with Visual Studio 16.7.2).\n","target":0,"question":"How to prettyprint a JSON file?\n\nI'd like to do the equivalent of the following in LINQ, but I can't figure out how:\n\nIEnumerable<Item> items = GetItems();\nitems.ForEach(i => i.DoStuff());\n\n\nWhat is the real syntax?\n"}
{"question_id":411592,"answer":"Here's an example that uses proper usings and implementation of idisposable:\nstatic void WriteToFile(string sourceFile, string destinationfile, bool append = true, int bufferSize = 4096)\n{\n    using (var sourceFileStream = new FileStream(sourceFile, FileMode.OpenOrCreate))\n    {\n        using (var destinationFileStream = new FileStream(destinationfile, FileMode.OpenOrCreate))\n        {\n            while (sourceFileStream.Position < sourceFileStream.Length)\n            {\n                destinationFileStream.WriteByte((byte)sourceFileStream.ReadByte());\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n...and there's also this\n    public static void WriteToFile(Stream stream, string destinationFile, int bufferSize = 4096, FileMode mode = FileMode.OpenOrCreate, FileAccess access = FileAccess.ReadWrite, FileShare share = FileShare.ReadWrite)\n    {\n        using (var destinationFileStream = new FileStream(destinationFile, mode, access, share))\n        {\n            while (stream.Position < stream.Length) \n            {\n                destinationFileStream.WriteByte((byte)stream.ReadByte());\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\nThe key is understanding the proper use of using (which should be implemented on the instantiation of the object that implements idisposable as shown above), and having a good idea as to how the properties work for streams. Position is literally the index within the stream (which starts at 0) that is followed as each byte is read using the readbyte method. In this case I am essentially using it in place of a for loop variable and simply letting it follow through all the way up to the length which is LITERALLY the end of the entire stream (in bytes). Ignore in bytes because it is practically the same and you will have something simple and elegant like this that resolves everything cleanly.\nKeep in mind, too, that the ReadByte method simply casts the byte to an int in the process and can simply be converted back.\nI'm gonna add another implementation I recently wrote to create a dynamic buffer of sorts to ensure sequential data writes to prevent massive overload\nprivate void StreamBuffer(Stream stream, int buffer)\n{\n    using (var memoryStream = new MemoryStream())\n    {\n        stream.CopyTo(memoryStream);\n        var memoryBuffer = memoryStream.GetBuffer();\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < memoryBuffer.Length;)\n        {\n            var networkBuffer = new byte[buffer];\n            for (int j = 0; j < networkBuffer.Length && i < memoryBuffer.Length; j++)\n            {\n                networkBuffer[j] = memoryBuffer[i];\n                i++;\n            }\n            \/\/Assuming destination file\n            destinationFileStream.Write(networkBuffer, 0, networkBuffer.Length);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThe explanation is fairly simple: we know that we need to keep in mind the entire set of data we wish to write and also that we only want to write certain amounts, so we want the first loop with the last parameter empty (same as while). Next, we  initialize a byte array buffer that is set to the size of what's passed, and with the second loop we compare j to the size of the buffer and the size of the original one, and if it's greater than the size of the original byte array, end the run.\n","target":0,"question":"With arrays, why is it the case that a[5] == 5[a]?\n\nI have a StreamReader object that I initialized with a stream, now I want to save this stream to disk (the stream may be a .gif or .jpg or .pdf).\n\nExisting Code:\n\nStreamReader sr = new StreamReader(myOtherObject.InputStream);\n\n\n\nI need to save this to disk (I have the filename).\nIn the future I may want to store this to SQL Server.\n\n\nI have the encoding type also, which I will need if I store it to SQL Server, correct?\n"}

{"question_id":44629890,"answer":"Short Answer:\nUse a folder instead of single-folder workspaces.\nOnly use multi-root Workspaces if needed. You need multi-root workspaces when you need to work with multiple project folders. This can be very helpful when you are working on several related projects at one time. For example, you might have a repository with a product's documentation which you like to keep current when you update the product source code.\nWhy \"Only use multi-root workspaces if needed\"?\nThere is only basically two differences between single-folder workspaces and a folder:\n\nyou open a single-folder workspaces by File > Open Workspace... and then select a <name>.code-workspace file. You open a folder by File > Open Folder... and then select a folder.\n\nWhen you open a single-folder workspaces using <name>.code-workspace file, all project specific settings will be added into the <name>.code-workspace file. When you open a project using folder, all project specific settings will be saved in .vscode\/settings.json file.\n\n\nEven if you take the time to create a <name>.code-workspace file for a single-folder workspaces, you can open that by menu File \u2192 Open Folder.... Depending on your access method, sometimes the settings can be in .vscode\/settings.json file or <name>.code-workspace file. Better use a consistent method to access your project folders. Moreover, launch configurations (.vscode\/launch.json) are saved beside Folder Settings (.vscode\/settings.json) and not Workspace Settings (<name>.code-workspace). Most of the time, you will need the .vscode directory anyway.\nLong Answer:\nThe documentation says:\n\nThe concept of a workspace enables VS Code to:\n\nConfigure settings that only apply to a specific folder or folders but not others.\nPersist task and debugger launch configurations that are only valid in the context of that workspace.\nStore and restore UI state associated with that workspace (for example, the files that are opened).\nSelectively enable or disable extensions only for that workspace.\n\n\nIn another place, it says:\n\nConfigurations can be overridden at multiple levels by the different\nsetting scopes:\n\nUser settings - Apply globally to all VS Code instances.\nWorkspace setting - Apply to the open folder or workspace and override User settings.\nWorkspace Folder settings - Apply to a specific folder of a multi-root workspace. Override User and Workspace settings.\n\n\nSo, there is basically three types of settings:\n\nFolder settings (highest precedence)\nWorkspace settings\nUser settings (lowest precedence)\n\nYou can modify folder settings by assigning a keybinding to Preferences: Open Folder Settings and then using the keybinding.\nYou can modify workspace settings by Ctrl + Shift + P \u2192 Preference: Open Workspace Settings.\nYou can modify user settings by File \u2192 Preferences \u2192 Settings.\nYour workspace settings will be added into the <name>.code-workspace file.\nYour folder settings will be saved in the .vscode\/settings.json file.\nThere is Confusion\nEvidence 1:\n\nYou may see the terms \"folder\" and \"workspace\" used interchangeably in\nVS Code documentation, issues, and community discussions. Think of a\nworkspace as the root of a project that has extra VS Code knowledge\nand capabilities.\n\nEvidence 2:\n\nA VS Code \"workspace\" is usually just your project root folder.\nWorkspace settings as well as debugging and task configurations are\nstored at the root in a .vscode folder.\n\nEvidence 3:\n\nThe visual difference of having a folder opened versus opening a\n.code-workspace file can be subtle. To give you a hint that a\n.code-workspace file has been opened, some areas of the user interface\n(for example, the root of the File Explorer) show an extra (Workspace)\nsuffix next to the name.\n\nWhere is the Confusion?\nThe devil is in the details (documentation and implementation).\nDocumentation\nIn the documentation, they said different things is different places. There is no consistency.\nIn one place they say:\n\nVS Code provides two different scopes for settings:\n\nUser Settings - Settings that apply globally to any instance of VS Code you open.\nWorkspace Settings - Settings stored inside your workspace and only apply when the workspace is opened.\n\n\nIn another place they say:\n\nConfigurations can be overridden at multiple levels by the different\nsetting scopes:\n\nUser settings - Apply globally to all VS Code instances.\nWorkspace setting - Apply to the open folder or workspace and override User settings.\nWorkspace Folder settings - Apply to a specific folder of a multi-root workspace. Override User and Workspace settings.\n\n\nSo, basically they did not consistently say that there are three levels of settings. Specially look at the title of their documentation for settings. It is titled User and Workspace Settings (notice how the Folder settings is missing from the title). It mentions Workspace Folder settings only once when they are talking about settings precedence.\nImplementation\nThe documentation says:\n\nWorkspace settings enable you to configure settings in the context of\nthe workspace you have opened and always override global user\nsettings. They are physically stored in a JSON file and their location\ndepends on whether you opened a folder as a workspace or you opened a\n.code-workspace file.\n\nSo, basically, when there isn\u2019t any workspace (for example, you did not open the project using <name>.code-workspace) and you Ctrl + Shift + P \u2192 Preference: Open Workspace Settings, it opens the .vscode\/settings.json file (which is actually for folder settings and not workspace settings, though the name explicitly says Open Workspace Settings).\nYou might have already noticed in the Long Answer: that \"they\" did not keep any easy way to directly access folder settings (you have to assigning a keybinding to the Preferences: Open Folder Settings command and then use the keybinding. You can not even access this \"Command\" from the Command Pallet using Ctrl + Shift + P directly).\nMoreover, you have to modify folder settings using Preference: Open Workspace Settings (note that you are modifying \"Folder settings\" using \"Open Workspace Settings\"). Whether Preference: Open Workspace Settings will modify folder settings or workspace settings depends on how you access the project (using menu File \u2192 Open Folder... or the <name>.code-workspace file).\nThey made a simple thing hard by trying to oversimplify it.\n","target":0,"question":"Parse JSON in JavaScript?\n\nFor example, Visual Studio Code talks about applying settings at the user level vs the workspace level.\nOn the one hand,\n\nit could refer to a project directory that you have opened; or\nit could refer to everything you have opened in a particular window.\n\nThe page referenced above says\n\n\"Workspace: These settings are stored inside your workspace\nin a .vscode folder and only apply when the workspace is opened.\"\n\n"}

{"question_id":173868,"answer":"The \"best\" way depends on the context and what you are doing with that file extension.\nHowever,\n\ud83e\udd47 pathinfo in general is the best when you consider all the angles.\npathinfo($file, PATHINFO_EXTENSION)\n\nIt is not the fastest, but it is fast enough. It is easy to read, easy to remember and reuse everywhere. Anyone can understand it at a glance and remove PATHINFO_EXT flag if they need more info about the file.\n\u274c strrpos method. described in several answers is faster yes but requires additional safety checks which, in turn, requires you to wrap it inside a function, to make it easily reusable.\nThen you must take the function with you from project to project or look it up.\nWrapping it in a function call with extra checks also makes it slower and if you need any other info about the file you now have other methods to call and at that point, you lose the speed advantage anyway whilst having a solution that's harder to read.\nThe potential for speed is there but is not worth it unless you need to address such a bottleneck.\n\u274c I'd also rule out any ideas using substr, explode, and most other manual manipulations for the same reasons mentioned above.\n\u274cSplFileInfo is very cool but takes up much more brain space \ud83d\ude1d with a lot of interfaces that you no doubt waste time learning only to look them up again next time. I'd only use it in specific cases where you will find the extra interfaces worth someone learning Spl when they come back to add\/edit your code later.\n\u274c I would not consider preg_replace at all as any regex function in PHP is on average 3 times slower than any other function, is harder to read, and is in most cases can easily be done with something simpler.

{"question_id":1769403,"answer":"Keyword Arguments are often shortened to kwargs in Python. In computer programming,\n\n\n  keyword arguments refer to a computer language's support for function\n  calls that clearly state the name of each parameter within the\n  function call.\n\n\nThe usage of the two asterisk before the parameter name, **kwargs, is when one doesn't know how many keyword arguments will be passed into the function.

{"question_id":849308,"answer":"In recent versions of Git you can add multiple pushurls for a given remote. Use the following to add two pushurls to your origin:\ngit remote set-url --add --push origin git:\/\/original\/repo.git\ngit remote set-url --add --push origin git:\/\/another\/repo.git\n\nSo when you push to origin, it will push to both repositories.\nUPDATE 1: Git 1.8.0.1 and 1.8.1 (and possibly other versions) seem to have a bug that causes --add to replace the original URL the first time you use it, so you need to re-add the original URL using the same command. Doing git remote -v should reveal the current URLs for each remote.\nUPDATE 2: Junio C. Hamano, the Git maintainer, explained it's how it was designed. Doing git remote set-url --add --push <remote_name>  adds a pushurl for a given remote, which overrides the default URL for pushes. However, you may add multiple pushurls for a given remote, which then allows you to push to multiple remotes using a single git push. You can verify this behavior below:\n$ git clone git:\/\/original\/repo.git\n$ git remote -v\norigin  git:\/\/original\/repo.git (fetch)\norigin  git:\/\/original\/repo.git (push)\n$ git config -l | grep '^remote\\.'\nremote.origin.url=git:\/\/original\/repo.git\nremote.origin.fetch=+refs\/heads\/*:refs\/remotes\/origin\/*\n\nNow, if you want to push to two or more repositories using a single command, you may create a new remote named all (as suggested by @Adam Nelson in comments), or keep using the origin, though the latter name is less descriptive for this purpose. If you still want to use origin, skip the following step, and use origin instead of all in all other steps.\nSo let's add a new remote called all that we'll reference later when pushing to multiple repositories:\n$ git remote add all git:\/\/original\/repo.git\n$ git remote -v\nall git:\/\/original\/repo.git (fetch)               <-- ADDED\nall git:\/\/original\/repo.git (push)                <-- ADDED\norigin  git:\/\/original\/repo.git (fetch)\norigin  git:\/\/original\/repo.git (push)\n$ git config -l | grep '^remote\\.all'\nremote.all.url=git:\/\/original\/repo.git            <-- ADDED\nremote.all.fetch=+refs\/heads\/*:refs\/remotes\/all\/* <-- ADDED\n\nThen let's add a pushurl to the all remote, pointing to another repository:\n$ git remote set-url --add --push all git:\/\/another\/repo.git\n$ git remote -v\nall git:\/\/original\/repo.git (fetch)\nall git:\/\/another\/repo.git (push)                 <-- CHANGED\norigin  git:\/\/original\/repo.git (fetch)\norigin  git:\/\/original\/repo.git (push)\n$ git config -l | grep '^remote\\.all'\nremote.all.url=git:\/\/original\/repo.git\nremote.all.fetch=+refs\/heads\/*:refs\/remotes\/all\/*\nremote.all.pushurl=git:\/\/another\/repo.git         <-- ADDED\n\nHere git remote -v shows the new pushurl for push, so if you do git push all master, it will push the master branch to git:\/\/another\/repo.git only. This shows how pushurl overrides the default url (remote.all.url).\nNow let's add another pushurl pointing to the original repository:\n$ git remote set-url --add --push all git:\/\/original\/repo.git\n$ git remote -v\nall git:\/\/original\/repo.git (fetch)\nall git:\/\/another\/repo.git (push)\nall git:\/\/original\/repo.git (push)                <-- ADDED\norigin  git:\/\/original\/repo.git (fetch)\norigin  git:\/\/original\/repo.git (push)\n$ git config -l | grep '^remote\\.all'\nremote.all.url=git:\/\/original\/repo.git\nremote.all.fetch=+refs\/heads\/*:refs\/remotes\/all\/*\nremote.all.pushurl=git:\/\/another\/repo.git\nremote.all.pushurl=git:\/\/original\/repo.git        <-- ADDED\n\nYou see both pushurls we added are kept. Now a single git push all master will push the master branch to both git:\/\/another\/repo.git and git:\/\/original\/repo.git.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: If your remotes have distinct rules (hooks) to accept\/reject a push, one remote may accept it while the other doesn't. Therefore, if you want them to have the exact same history, you'll need to fix your commits locally to make them acceptable by both remotes and push again, or you might end up in a situation where you can only fix it by rewriting history (using push -f), and that could cause problems for people that have already pulled your previous changes from the repo.\n","target":0,"question":"Disabling Chrome cache for website development\n\nThe short: is there a way to have a git repo push to and pull from a list of remote repos (rather than a single \"origin\")?\n\nThe long: I often have a situation when I'm developing an app in multiple computers, with different connectivity \u2013 say a laptop while on transit, a computer \"A\" while I'm in a certain location, and another computer \"B\" while on another.

{"question_id":2944469,"answer":"The other answers suggesting checking out the other branch, then committing to it, only work if the checkout is possible given the local modifications. If not, you're in the most common use case for git stash:\n\ngit stash\ngit checkout other-branch\ngit stash pop\n\n\nThe first stash hides away your changes (basically making a temporary commit), and the subsequent stash pop re-applies them.

If all the stashed changes indeed belong on that other branch, you're simply going to have to sort through them - it's a consequence of having made your changes on the wrong branch.\n\nOn the other hand, if you've really messed up, and your work tree has a mix of changes for the two branches, and the conflicts are just in the ones you want to commit back on the original branch, you can save some work. As usual, there are a lot of ways to do this. Here's one, starting from after you pop and see the conflicts:\n\n# Unstage everything (warning: this leaves files with conflicts in your tree)\ngit reset\n\n# Add the things you *do* want to commit here\ngit add -p     # or maybe git add -i\ngit commit\n\n# The stash still exists; pop only throws it away if it applied cleanly\ngit checkout original-branch\ngit stash pop\n\n# Add the changes meant for this branch\ngit add -p\ngit commit\n\n# And throw away the rest\ngit reset --hard\n\n\nAlternatively, if you realize ahead of the time that this is going to happen, simply commit the things that belong on the current branch. You can always come back and amend that commit:\n\ngit add -p\ngit commit\ngit stash\ngit checkout other-branch\ngit stash pop\n\n\nAnd of course, remember that this all took a bit of work, and avoid it next time, perhaps by putting your current branch name in your prompt by adding $(__git_ps1) to your PS1 environment variable in your bashrc file. (See for example the Git in Bash documentation.)\n","target":0,"question":"How to fix java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: Unsupported major.minor version\n\nSometimes it happens that I make some changes in my working directory, and I realize that these changes should be committed in a branch different to the current one.

{"question_id":21117160,"answer":"One of the good features introduced in ES6 was javascript modules in an efficient way by which we can export and import variables, functions, and classes between different .js files.\nWe have two different ways to export: Named exports and Default exports. To properly understand the default export, we must first understand the named export well.\nNamed export\nIn this case, in the source file, we export the desired variables, functions, or classes that have a specific name. The syntax is as follows:\n\/\/ file: source.js\nexport const myVariable = \/* \u2026 *\/\nexport function myFunction() { \/* \u2026 *\/ }\nexport class myClass { \/* \u2026 *\/ }\n\nNow, to access the above items in the target file, we must import them as follows:\n\/\/ file: target.js (in the same directory as the source.js file) \nimport { myVariable } from \".\/source.js\"\nimport { myFunction } from \".\/source.js\"\nimport { myClass } from \".\/source.js\"\n\nNow it's time to get to the main question \"what exactly is the default export\"?\nDefault export\nExcept for the cases where we exported them by name (named exports), there is a similar feature called default export that can be used only once in each .js file. See the following example and compare it with the previous source.js file:\n\/\/ file: source.js\nexport default function myNewFunction() { \/* \u2026 *\/ }\nexport const myVariable = \/* \u2026 *\/\nexport function myFunction() { \/* \u2026 *\/ }\nexport class myClass { \/* \u2026 *\/ }\n\nIn fact, each .js file can have \"multiple named exports\" and \"only one default export\"_ here myNewFunction is exported as default. With this, when importing in the target file, javascript understands which item is exported as default.\nThe item that is \"exported as default\" (myNewFunction) is imported in the target.js file as follows:\n\/\/ file: target.js (in the same directory as the source.js file)\nimport anyName from \".\/source.js\"\n\nLook carefully at the differences! Here, we don't have { } sign after import, and we used a custom name that we didn't have in the source file. Here anyName represents myNewFunction.\nThis shows that we can give \"any desired name\" to the item that is \"exported as default\" when importing it and just pointing to the \"path\" of the source file, JavaScript will find that file and import it.\nSome important notes:\n\nUnlike named exports, in default export we don't need to export named\nitems and we can export \"unnamed\" items as well.\n\nWhy did they add the Default export feature to ES6 at all!? for the ability\nto export \"unnamed items\" (anonymous functions and classes) as well as\nexpressions and even object literals in addition to named items.\n\n\n","target":0,"question":"What does the [Flags] Enum Attribute mean in C#?\n\nFile: SafeString.js\n\/\/ Build out our basic SafeString type\nfunction SafeString(string) {\n  this.string = string;\n}\n\nSafeString.prototype.toString = function() {\n  return \"\" + this.string;\n};\n\nexport default SafeString;\n\nI have never seen export default before.

{"question_id":1658294,"answer":"LEA vs MOV (reply to the original question)\nLEA is not a funky MOV. When you use MOV, it calculates the address and accesses the memory. LEA just calculates the address, it doesn't actually access memory. This is the difference.\nIn 8086 and later, LEA just sets a sum of up to two source registers and an immediate value to a destination register. For example, lea bp, [bx+si+3] sets to the bp register the sum of bx plus si plus 3. You cannot achieve this calculation to save the result to a register with MOV.\nThe 80386 processor introduced a series of scaling modes, in which the index register value can be multiplied by a valid scaling factor to obtain the displacement. The valid scale factors are 1, 2, 4, and 8. Therefore, you can use instructions like lea ebp, [ebx+esi*8+3].\nLDS & LES (optional further reading)\nIn contrast to LEA, there are instructions LDS and LES, that, to the contrary, load values from memory to the pair of registers: one segment register (DS or ES) and one general register. There are also versions for the other registers: LFS, LGS and LSS for FS, GS and SS segment registers, respectively (introduced in 80386).\nSo, these instructions load \"far\" pointer - a pointer consisting of a 16-bit segment selector and a 16-bit (or a 32-bit, depending on the mode) offset, so the total far pointer size was 32-bit in 16-bit mode and 48-bit in 32-bit mode.\nThese are handy instructions for 16-bit mode, be it 16-bit real mode or 16-bit protected mode.\nUnder 32-bit mode, there is no need in these instructions since OSes set all segment bases to zero (flat memory model), so there is no need to load segment registers.  We just use 32-bit pointers, not 48.\nUnder 64-bit modes, these instructions are not implemented. Their opcodes give access violation interrupt (exception). Since Intel's implementation of VEX - \"vector extensions - (AVX), Intel took their opcodes of LDS and LES and started using them for VEX prefixes. As Peter Cordes pointed out, that is why only x\/ymm0..7 are accessible in 32-bit mode (quote): \"the VEX prefixes were carefully designed to only overlap with invalid encodings of LDS and LES in 32-bit mode, where R\u0305 X\u0305 B\u0305 are all 1.

{"question_id":94935,"answer":"range() in Python 2.x\n\nThis function is essentially the old range() function that was available in Python 2.x and returns an instance of a list object that contains the elements in the specified range.  \n\nHowever, this implementation is too inefficient when it comes to initialise a list with a range of numbers. For example, for i in range(1000000) would be a very expensive command to execute, both in terms of memory and time usage as it requires the storage of this list into the memory. \n\n\n\nrange() in Python 3.x and xrange() in Python 2.x\n\nPython 3.x introduced a newer implementation of range() (while the newer implementation was already available in Python 2.x through the xrange() function). \n\nThe range() exploits a strategy known as lazy evaluation. Instead of creating a huge list of elements in range, the newer implementation introduces the class range, a lightweight object that represents the required elements in the given range, without storing them explicitly in memory (this might sound like generators but the concept of lazy evaluation is different). \n\n\n\nAs an example, consider the following: \n\n# Python 2.x\n>>> a = range(10)\n>>> type(a)\n<type 'list'>\n>>> b = xrange(10)\n>>> type(b)\n<type 'xrange'>\n\n\nand \n\n# Python 3.x\n>>> a = range(10)\n>>> type(a)\n<class 'range'>\n\n","target":0,"question":"startsWith() and endsWith() functions in PHP\n\nApparently xrange is faster but I have no idea why it's faster (and no proof besides the anecdotal so far that it is faster) or what besides that is different about\n\nfor i in range(0, 20):\nfor i in xrange(0, 20):\n\n"}

{"question_id":2081640,"answer":"Unicode string literals\nUnicode string literals (string literals prefixed by u) are no longer used in Python 3. They are still valid but just for compatibility purposes with Python 2.\nRaw string literals\nIf you want to create a string literal consisting of only easily typable characters like english letters or numbers, you can simply type them: 'hello world'. But if you want to include also some more exotic characters, you'll have to use some workaround.\nOne of the workarounds are Escape sequences. This way you can for example represent a new line in your string simply by adding two easily typable characters \\n to your string literal. So when you print the 'hello\\nworld' string, the words will be printed on separate lines. That's very handy!\nOn the other hand, sometimes you might want to include the actual characters \\ and n into your string \u2013 you might not want them to be interpreted as a new line. Look at these examples:\n'New updates are ready in c:\\windows\\updates\\new'\n'In this lesson we will learn what the \\n escape sequence does.'\n\nIn such situations you can just prefix the string literal with the r character like this: r'hello\\nworld' and no escape sequences will be interpreted by Python. The string will be printed exactly as you created it.\nRaw string literals are not completely \"raw\"?\nMany people expect the raw string literals to be raw in a sense that \"anything placed between the quotes is ignored by Python\". That is not true. Python still recognizes all the escape sequences, it just does not interpret them - it leaves them unchanged instead. It means that raw string literals still have to be valid string literals.\nFrom the lexical definition of a string literal:\nstring     ::=  \"'\" stringitem* \"'\"\nstringitem ::=  stringchar | escapeseq\nstringchar ::=  <any source character except \"\\\" or newline or the quote>\nescapeseq  ::=  \"\\\" <any source character>\n\nIt is clear that string literals (raw or not) containing a bare quote character: 'hello'world' or ending with a backslash: 'hello world\\' are not valid.\n","target":0,"question":"How can I convert a stack trace to a string?\n\nWhile asking this question, I realized I didn't know much about raw strings.

{"question_id":56867,"answer":"I've found that a pattern of Interface > Abstract > Concrete works in the following use-case:\n\n1.  You have a general interface (eg IPet)\n2.  You have a implementation that is less general (eg Mammal)\n3.

For example:\n\npublic interface IPet{\n\n    public boolean hasHair();\n\n    public boolean walksUprights();\n\n    public boolean hasNipples();\n}\n\n\nNow, since all mammals have hair and nipples (AFAIK, I'm not a zoologist), we can roll this into the abstract base class\n\npublic abstract class Mammal() implements IPet{\n\n     @override\n     public walksUpright(){\n         throw new NotSupportedException(\"Walks Upright not implemented\");\n     }\n\n     @override\n     public hasNipples(){return true}\n\n     @override\n     public hasHair(){return true}\n\n\nAnd then the concrete classes merely define that they walk upright.\n\npublic class Ape extends Mammal(){\n\n    @override\n    public walksUpright(return true)\n}\n\npublic class Catextends Mammal(){\n\n    @override\n    public walksUpright(return false)\n}\n\n\nThis design is nice when there are lots of concrete classes, and you don't want to maintain boilerplate just to program to an interface.  If new methods were added to the interface, it would break all of the resulting classes, so you are still getting the advantages of the interface approach.\n\nIn this case, the abstract could just as well be concrete; however, the abstract designation helps to emphasize that this pattern is being employed.\n","target":0,"question":"What is a monad?\n\nWhen should I use an interface and when should I use a base class? \n\nShould it always be an interface if I don't want to actually define a base implementation of the methods?\n\nIf I have a Dog and Cat class.

{"question_id":7105505,"answer":"\n  Definition\n\n\nAggregate method is an extension method for generic collections. Aggregate method applies a function to each item of a collection. Not just only applies a function, but takes its result as initial value for the next iteration. So, as a result, we will get a computed value (min, max, avg, or other statistical value) from a collection.\n\nTherefore, Aggregate method is a form of safe implementation of a recursive function.\n\nSafe, because the recursion will iterate over each item of a collection and we can\u2019t get any infinite loop suspension by wrong exit condition. Recursive, because the current function\u2019s result is used as a parameter for the next function call.\n\n\n  Syntax:\n\n\ncollection.Aggregate(seed, func, resultSelector);\n\n\n\nseed - initial value by default;\nfunc - our recursive function. It can be a lambda-expression, a Func delegate or a function type T F(T result, T nextValue);\nresultSelector - it can be a function like func or an expression to compute, transform, change, convert the final result.\n\n\nHow it works:\n\nvar nums = new[]{1, 2};\nvar result = nums.Aggregate(1, (result, n) => result + n); \/\/result = (1 + 1) + 2 = 4\nvar result2 = nums.Aggregate(0, (result, n) => result + n, response => (decimal)response\/2.0); \/\/result2 = ((0 + 1) + 2)*1.0\/2.0 = 3*1.0\/2.0 = 3.0\/2.0 = 1.5\n\n\n\n  Practical usage:\n\n\n\nFind Factorial from a number n:\n\n\n\nint n = 7;\nvar numbers = Enumerable.Range(1, n);\nvar factorial = numbers.Aggregate((result, x) => result * x);\n\n\n\nwhich is doing the same thing as this function:\n\npublic static int Factorial(int n)\n{\n   if (n < 1) return 1;\n\n   return n * Factorial(n - 1);\n}\n\n\n\nAggregate() is one of the most powerful LINQ extension method, like Select() and Where(). We can use it to replace the Sum(), Min(). Max(), Avg() functionality, or to change it by implementing addition context:\n\n\n    var numbers = new[]{3, 2, 6, 4, 9, 5, 7};\n    var avg = numbers.Aggregate(0.0, (result, x) => result + x, response => (double)response\/(double)numbers.Count());\n    var min = numbers.Aggregate((result, x) => (result < x)? result: x);\n\n\n\nMore complex usage of extension methods:\n\n\n    var path = @\u201cc:\\path-to-folder\u201d;\n\n    string[] txtFiles = Directory.GetFiles(path).Where(f => f.EndsWith(\u201c.txt\u201d)).ToArray<string>();\n    var output = txtFiles.Select(f => File.ReadAllText(f, Encoding.Default)).Aggregate<string>((result, content) => result + content);\n\n    File.WriteAllText(path + \u201csummary.txt\u201d, output, Encoding.Default);\n\n    Console.WriteLine(\u201cText files merged into: {0}\u201d, output); \/\/or other log info\n\n","target":0,"question":"Why do Python classes inherit object?\n\nThis might sound lame, but  I have not been able to find a really good explanation of Aggregate.\n\nGood means short, descriptive, comprehensive with a small and clear example.\n"}

{"question_id":204476,"answer":"\"int\" is now mandated by the ISO for both C and C++ as the return type for \"main\".\nBoth languages previously allowed implicit \"int\", and for \"main\" to be declared without any return type. In fact, the very first external release of C++, itself (Release E of \"cfront\" from February 1985), which is written in its own language, declared \"main\" without any return type ... but returned an integer value: the number of errors or 127, whichever was smaller\nAs to the question of what to return: the ISO standards for C and C++ work in synchronization with the POSIX standard. For any hosted environment conforming to the POSIX standard,\n(1) 126 is reserved for the OS's shell to indicate utilities that are not executable,\n(2) 127 is reserved for the OS's shell to indicate that a command that is not found,\n(3) the exit values for utilities are separately spelled out on a utility-by-utility basis,\n(4) programs that invoke utilities outside the shell should use similar values for their own exits,\n(5) the values 128 and above are meant for use to indicate termination that results from receiving a signal,\n(6) the values 1-125 are for failures,\n(7) the value 0 is for success.\nIn C and C++ the value EXIT_SUCCESS and EXIT_FAILURE are meant for use to handle the most common situation: for programs that report a success or just a generic failure. They may, but need not, be respectively equal to 0 and 1.\nThat means if you want a program to return different values for different failure modes or status indications, while continuing to make use of those two constants, you might have to resort to first making sure that your additional \"failure\" or \"status\" values lie strictly between max(EXIT_SUCCESS, EXIT_FAILURE) and 126 (and hope that there's enough room in-between), and to reserve EXIT_FAILURE to mark the generic or default failure mode.\nOtherwise, if you're not going to use the constants, then you should go by what POSIX mandates.\nFor programs meant for use on free-standing environments or on hosts that are not POSIX-compliant, I can say nothing more, except the following:\nI have written free-standing programs -- as multi-threaded programs on a custom run-time system (and a custom tool-base for everything else). The general rule I followed was that:\n(1) \"main\" ran the foreground processes, which usually consisted only of start-up, configuration or initialization routines, but could have just as well included foreground processes meant for continual operation (like polling loops),\n(2) \"main\" returns into an infinite sleep & wait loop,\n(3) no return value for \"main\" was defined or used,\n(4) background processes ran separately, as interrupt-driven & event-driven threads, independently of \"main\", terminated only by the receipt of a reset signal or by other threads ... or by simply shutting off the monitoring of whatever event was driving the thread.\n","target":0,"question":"How can I generate a Git patch for a specific commit?\n\nWhat is the correct (most efficient) way to define the main() function in C and C++ \u2014 int main() or void main() \u2014 and why?

{"question_id":9755721,"answer":"We can use another optimal solution to build a heap instead of inserting each element repeatedly. It goes as follows:\n\nArbitrarily putting the n elements into the array to respect the\nshape property of heap.\nStarting from the lowest level and moving upwards, sift the root of\neach subtree downward as in the heapify-down process until the heap\nproperty is restored.\n\nThis process can be illustrated with the following image:\n\nNext, let\u2019s analyze the time complexity of this above process. Suppose there are n elements in the heap, and the height of the heap is h (for the heap in the above image, the height is 3). Then we should have the following relationship:\n\nWhen there is only one node in the last level then n = 2^h\n. And when the last level of the tree is fully filled then n = 2^(h+1).\nAnd start from the bottom as level 0 (the root node is level h), in level j, there are at most 2^(h-j) nodes. And each node at most takes j times swap operation. So in level j, the total number of operation is j*2^(h-j).\nSo the total running time for building the heap is proportional to:\n\nIf we factor out the 2^h term, then we get:\n\n\u200bAs we know, \u2211j\/2\u02b2 is a series converges to 2 (in detail, you can refer to this wiki).\nUsing this we have:\n\nBased on the condition 2^h <= n, so we have:\n\nNow we prove that building a heap is a linear operation.\n","target":0,"question":"How to directly initialize a HashMap (in a literal way)?\n\nCan someone help explain how can building a heap be O(n) complexity?\nInserting an item into a heap is O(log n), and the insert is repeated n\/2 times (the remainder are leaves, and can't violate the heap property).

{"question_id":3487991,"answer":"I got some additional resources here which clarify certain things on why we need refresh_token. Some of the key points of these resources are following:\n\nIn real world, it's better to have separate servers called authServer and resourceServer\/s\n\nauthServer  - used only for authentication and authorization. This server's responsibility is to issue refresh token, access token and also login & logout the users\nresourceServer - this server (can also be multiple servers load balanced) provides protected data. This data can be like products, reviews and so on in an e-commerce-project for example\n\n\nOne of the uses of refresh_token is, we don't have to send username and password (credentials) over the wire (from front-end to authServer) every time when we need a new access_token. This should only be done first time (when you don't have refresh_token yet), and the refresh_token will get you the new access_token now on, from authServer so you can continue to make requests to your protected resourceServer. This advantage here is, the users don't have to provide credentials every time because of which the users' username and password is not easily compromised.\nThe other main use of refresh_token is that, let's say your authServer is very protected compared to resourceServer in real world (third party services like auth0, okta, azure and so on or your own implementation). You will only send your access_token to the resourceServer (to get data) and you will never have to send refresh_token to resourceServer . So there is a good chance that your access_token when sent to resourceServer, there is a hacker intercepting your resourceServer (since it's not that secure like authServer) who gets access to your short lived access_token.\n\nFor this reason, the access_token is has short life span (like 30 minutes). Remember, when this access_token expires, you will send refresh_token to authServer (which is very secure than resourceServer)  to get a new access_token. Since you are not sending the refresh_token to the resourceServer at any time, there is no way that the hacker who is intercepting the resourceServer gets your refresh_token. If you, as a developer, still get a doubt that your users' refresh_token might also be hacked, then you can logout all users (make refresh_token invalid for all users) and that way the users will login again (providing username and password) to get a new refresh_token + access_token and things will get on track again.\n\n\n\nSome useful resources\nWorkflow with and without refresh token - Youtube\nJWT authentication code example - Node JS - Youtube\n","target":0,"question":"How to manage a redirect request after a jQuery Ajax call\n\nSection 4.2 of the draft OAuth 2.0 protocol indicates that an authorization server can return both an access_token (which is used to authenticate oneself with a resource) as well as a refresh_token, which is used purely to create a new access_token:\nhttps:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/rfc\/rfc6749#section-4.2\nWhy have both?

{"question_id":729921,"answer":"The important point to consider is the performance.\nThe only way to run a function periodically using setTimeout is to call it recursively with the target function, and when you check it, it appears that it works asynchronously put when you see the call stack you will find it keep growing by the time. In fact, it is sensible. Since Javascript does not support multi-threading, it is impossible to finish calling the parent function before finishing the child function, therefor, the stack will keep growing as long as there is recursive calling.\nWhilst, with setInterval we don't need to call the target function recursively since it has a logic that runs it periodically as a loop.

A cursory glance at the other Xerces questions on SO seem to indicate that almost all Maven users are \"touched\" by this problem at some point.  Unfortunately, understanding the problem requires a bit of knowledge about the history of Xerces...\nHistory\n\nXerces is the most widely used XML parser in the Java ecosystem.  Almost every library or framework written in Java uses Xerces in some capacity (transitively, if not directly).\n\nThe Xerces jars included in the official binaries are, to this day, not versioned.  For example, the Xerces 2.11.0 implementation jar is named xercesImpl.jar and not xercesImpl-2.11.0.jar.\n\nThe Xerces team does not use Maven, which means they do not\nupload an official release to Maven Central.\n\nXerces used to be released as a single jar (xerces.jar), but was split into two jars, one containing the API (xml-apis.jar) and one containing the implementations of those APIs (xercesImpl.jar).  Many older Maven POMs still declare a dependency on xerces.jar.  At some point in the past, Xerces was also released as xmlParserAPIs.jar, which some older POMs also depend on.\n\nThe versions assigned to the xml-apis and xercesImpl jars by those who deploy their jars to Maven repositories are often different.  For example, xml-apis might be given version 1.3.03 and xercesImpl might be given version 2.8.0, even though both are from Xerces 2.8.0.  This is because people often tag the xml-apis jar with the version of the specifications that it implements.  There is a very nice, but incomplete breakdown of this here.\n\nTo complicate matters, Xerces is the XML parser used in the reference implementation of the Java API for XML Processing (JAXP), included in the JRE. The implementation classes are repackaged under the com.sun.* namespace, which makes it dangerous to access them directly, as they may not be available in some JREs.  However, not all of the Xerces functionality is exposed via the java.* and javax.* APIs; for example, there is no API that exposes Xerces serialization.\n\nAdding to the confusing mess, almost all servlet containers (JBoss, Jetty, Glassfish, Tomcat, etc.), ship with Xerces in one or more of their \/lib folders.\n\n\nProblems\nConflict Resolution\nFor some -- or perhaps all -- of the reasons above, many\norganizations publish and consume custom builds of Xerces in their\nPOMs.  This is not really a problem if you have a small application and are only using Maven Central, but it quickly becomes an issue for enterprise software where Artifactory or Nexus is proxying multiple repositories (JBoss, Hibernate, etc.):\n\nFor example, organization A might publish xml-apis as:\n<groupId>org.apache.xerces<\/groupId>\n<artifactId>xml-apis<\/artifactId>\n<version>2.9.1<\/version>\n\nMeanwhile, organization B might publish the same jar as:\n<groupId>xml-apis<\/groupId>\n<artifactId>xml-apis<\/artifactId>\n<version>1.3.04<\/version>\n\nAlthough B's jar is a lower version than A's jar, Maven does not know\nthat they are the same artifact because they have different\ngroupIds. Thus, it cannot perform conflict resolution and both\njars will be included as resolved dependencies:\n\nClassloader Hell\nAs mentioned above, the JRE ships with Xerces in the JAXP RI.  While it would be nice to mark all Xerces Maven dependencies as <exclusion>s or as <provided>, the third-party code you depend on may or may not work with the version provided in JAXP of the JDK you're using.  In addition, you have the Xerces jars shipped in your servlet container to contend with. This leaves you with a number of choices: Do you delete the servlet version and hope that your container runs on the JAXP version? Is it better to leave the servlet version, and hope that your application frameworks run on the servlet version? If one or two of the unresolved conflicts outlined above manage to slip into your product (easy to happen in a large organization), you quickly find yourself in classloader hell, wondering which version of Xerces the classloader is picking at runtime and whether or not it will pick the same jar in Windows and Linux (probably not).\nSolutions?\nWe've tried marking all Xerces Maven dependencies as <provided> or as an <exclusion>, but this is difficult to enforce (especially with a large team) given that the artifacts have so many aliases (xml-apis, xerces, xercesImpl, xmlParserAPIs, etc.).  Additionally, our third party libs\/frameworks may not run on the JAXP version or the version provided by a servlet container.\nHow can we best address this problem with Maven?  Do we have to exercise such fine-grained control over our dependencies, and then rely on tiered classloading?  Is there some way to globally exclude all Xerces dependencies, and force all of our frameworks\/libs to use the JAXP version?\n\nUPDATE: Joshua Spiewak has uploaded a patched version of the Xerces build scripts to XERCESJ-1454 that allows for upload to Maven Central.  Vote\/watch\/contribute to this issue and let's fix this problem once and for all.\n"}

{"question_id":158706,"answer":"I really like when things clean up after them selves... So I made some wrapper classes that do all the cleanup for me! These are documented further down.\nThe end code is quite readable and accessible.  I haven't yet found any phantom instances of Excel running after I Close() the workbooks and Quit() the application (besides where I debug and close the app mid process).\nfunction void OpenCopyClose() {\n  var excel = new ExcelApplication();\n  var workbook1 = excel.OpenWorkbook(\"C:\\Temp\\file1.xslx\", readOnly: true);\n  var readOnlysheet = workbook1.Worksheet(\"sheet1\");\n\n  var workbook2 = excel.OpenWorkbook(\"C:\\Temp\\file2.xslx\");\n  var writeSheet = workbook.Worksheet(\"sheet1\");\n\n  \/\/ do all the excel manipulation\n\n  \/\/ read from the first workbook, write to the second workbook.\n  var a1 = workbook1.Cells[1, 1];\n  workbook2.Cells[1, 1] = a1\n\n  \/\/ explicit clean-up\n  workbook1.Close(false);\n  workbook2 .Close(true);\n  excel.Quit();\n}\n\nNote: You can skip the Close() and Quit() calls but if you are writing to an Excel document you will at least want to Save().  When the objects go out of scope (the method returns) the class finalizers will automatically kick in and do any cleanup.  Any references to COM objects from the Worksheet COM object will automatically be managed and cleaned up as long as you are careful with the scope of your variables, eg keep variables local to the current scope only when storing references to COM objects.  You can easily copy values you need to POCOs if you need, or create additional wrapper classes as discussed below.\nTo manage all this, I have created a class, DisposableComObject, that acts as a wrapper for any COM object.  It implements the IDisposable interface and also contains a finalizer for those that don't like using.\nThe Dispose() method calls Marshal.ReleaseComObject(ComObject) and then sets the ComObjectRef property to null.\nThe object is in a disposed state when the private ComObjectRef property is null.\nIf the ComObject property is accessed after being disposed, a ComObjectAccessedAfterDisposeException exception is thrown.\nThe Dispose() method can be called manually.  It is also called by the finalizer, at the conclusion of a using block, and for using var at the conclusion of the scope of that variable.\nThe top level classes from Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel, Application, Workbook, and Worksheet, get their own wrapper classes where each are subclasses of DisposableComObject\nHere is the code:\n\/\/\/ <summary>\n\/\/\/ References to COM objects must be explicitly released when done.\n\/\/\/ Failure to do so can result in odd behavior and processes remaining running after the application has stopped.\n\/\/\/ This class helps to automate the process of disposing the references to COM objects.\n\/\/\/ <\/summary>\npublic abstract class DisposableComObject : IDisposable\n{\n    public class ComObjectAccessedAfterDisposeException : Exception\n    {\n        public ComObjectAccessedAfterDisposeException() : base(\"COM object has been accessed after being disposed\") { }\n    }\n\n    \/\/\/ <summary>The actual COM object<\/summary>\n    private object ComObjectRef { get; set; }\n\n    \/\/\/ <summary>The COM object to be used by subclasses<\/summary>\n    \/\/\/ <exception cref=\"ComObjectAccessedAfterDisposeException\">When the COM object has been disposed<\/exception>\n    protected object ComObject => ComObjectRef ?? throw new ComObjectAccessedAfterDisposeException();\n\n    public DisposableComObject(object comObject) => ComObjectRef = comObject;\n\n    \/\/\/ <summary>\n    \/\/\/ True, if the COM object has been disposed.\n    \/\/\/ <\/summary>\n    protected bool IsDisposed() => ComObjectRef is null;\n\n    public void Dispose()\n    {\n        Dispose(true);\n        GC.SuppressFinalize(this); \/\/ in case a subclass implements a finalizer\n    }\n\n    \/\/\/ <summary>\n    \/\/\/ This method releases the COM object and removes the reference.\n    \/\/\/ This allows the garbage collector to clean up any remaining instance.\n    \/\/\/ <\/summary>\n    \/\/\/ <param name=\"disposing\">Set to true<\/param>\n    protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)\n    {\n        if (!disposing || IsDisposed()) return;\n        Marshal.ReleaseComObject(ComObject);\n        ComObjectRef = null;\n    }\n\n    ~DisposableComObject()\n    {\n        Dispose(true);\n    }\n}\n\nThere is also a handy generic subclass which makes usage slightly easier.\npublic abstract class DisposableComObject<T> : DisposableComObject\n{\n    protected new T ComObject => (T)base.ComObject;\n\n    public DisposableComObject(T comObject) : base(comObject) { }\n}\n\nFinally, we can use DisposableComObject<T> to create our wrapper classes for the Excel interop classes.\nThe ExcelApplication subclass has a reference to a new Excel application instance and is used to open workbooks.\nOpenWorkbook() returns an ExcelWorkbook which is also a subclass of DisposableComObject.\nDispose() has been overridden to quit the Excel application before calling the base Dispose() method.  Quit() is an alias of Dispose().\npublic class ExcelApplication : DisposableComObject<Application>\n{\n    public class OpenWorkbookActionCancelledException : Exception\n    {\n        public string Filename { get; }\n\n        public OpenWorkbookActionCancelledException(string filename, COMException ex) : base($\"The workbook open action was cancelled. {ex.Message}\", ex) => Filename = filename;\n    }\n\n    \/\/\/ <summary>The actual Application from Interop.Excel<\/summary>\n    Application App => ComObject;\n\n    public ExcelApplication() : base(new Application()) { }\n\n    \/\/\/ <summary>Open a workbook.<\/summary>\n    public ExcelWorkbook OpenWorkbook(string filename, bool readOnly = false, string password = null, string writeResPassword = null)\n    {\n        try\n        {\n            var workbook = App.Workbooks.Open(Filename: filename, UpdateLinks: (XlUpdateLinks)0, ReadOnly: readOnly, Password: password, WriteResPassword: writeResPassword, );\n\n            return new ExcelWorkbook(workbook);\n        }\n        catch (COMException ex)\n        {\n            \/\/ If the workbook is already open and the request mode is not read-only, the user will be presented\n            \/\/ with a prompt from the Excel application asking if the workbook should be opened in read-only mode.\n            \/\/ This exception is raised when when the user clicks the Cancel button in that prompt.\n            throw new OpenWorkbookActionCancelledException(filename, ex);\n        }\n    }\n\n    \/\/\/ <summary>Quit the running application.<\/summary>\n    public void Quit() => Dispose(true);\n\n    \/\/\/ <inheritdoc\/>\n    protected override void Dispose(bool disposing)\n    {\n        if (!disposing || IsDisposed()) return;\n        App.Quit();\n        base.Dispose(disposing);\n    }\n}\n\n\nExcelWorkbook also subclasses DisposableComObject<Workbook> and is used to open worksheets.\nThe Worksheet() methods returns ExcelWorksheet which, you guessed it, is also an subclass of DisposableComObject<Workbook>.\nThe Dispose() method is overridden and fist closes the worksheet before calling the base Dispose().\nNOTE: I've added some extension methods which is uses to iterate over Workbook.Worksheets.  If you get compile errors, this is why.  Ill add the extension methods at the end.\npublic class ExcelWorkbook : DisposableComObject<Workbook>\n{\n    public class WorksheetNotFoundException : Exception\n    {\n        public WorksheetNotFoundException(string message) : base(message) { }\n    }\n\n    \/\/\/ <summary>The actual Workbook from Interop.Excel<\/summary>\n    Workbook Workbook => ComObject;\n\n    \/\/\/ <summary>The worksheets within the workbook<\/summary>\n    public IEnumerable<ExcelWorksheet> Worksheets => worksheets ??

I haven't yet encountered a situation where COM objects accessed from properties of the Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Worksheet object need to manually wrapped like was needed with Application, Workbook, and Worksheet.  These all seem to clean them selves up automatically.  Mostly, I was just iterating over Ranges and getting or setting values, so my particular use-case isn't  as advanced as the available functionality.\nThere is no override of Dispose() in this case as no special action needs to take place for worksheets.\npublic class ExcelWorksheet : DisposableComObject<Worksheet>\n{\n    \/\/\/ <summary>The actual Worksheet from Interop.Excel<\/summary>\n    Worksheet Worksheet => ComObject;\n\n    \/\/\/ <summary>The worksheet name<\/summary>\n    public string Name => Worksheet.Name;\n\n    \/\/ <summary>The worksheets cells (Unwrapped COM object)<\/summary>\n    public Range Cells => Worksheet.Cells;\n\n    public ExcelWorksheet(Worksheet worksheet) : base(worksheet) { }\n\n    \/\/\/ <inheritdoc cref=\"WorksheetExtensions.UsedRows(Worksheet)\"\/>\n    public IEnumerable<Range> UsedRows() => Worksheet.UsedRows().ToList();\n}\n\nIt is possible to add even more wrapper classes.  Just add additional methods to ExcelWorksheet as needed and return the COM object in a wrapper class.

{"question_id":5207160,"answer":"The Cloud Under blog has a good explanation of CSRF tokens. (archived)\n\nImagine you had a website like a simplified Twitter, hosted on a.com.\nSigned in users can enter some text (a tweet) into a form that\u2019s being\nsent to the server as a POST request and published when they hit the\nsubmit button. On the server the user is identified by a cookie\ncontaining their unique session ID, so your server knows who posted\nthe Tweet.\nThe form could be as simple as that:\n <form action=\"http:\/\/a.com\/tweet\" method=\"POST\">\n   <input type=\"text\" name=\"tweet\">\n   <input type=\"submit\">\n <\/form> \n\n\n\nNow imagine, a bad guy copies and pastes this form to his malicious\nwebsite, let\u2019s say b.com. The form would still work. As long\nas a user is signed in to your Twitter (i.e. they\u2019ve got a valid\nsession cookie for a.com), the POST request would be sent to\nhttp:\/\/a.com\/tweet and processed as usual when the user clicks the\nsubmit button.\nSo far this is not a big issue as long as the user is made aware about\nwhat the form exactly does, but what if our bad guy tweaks the form\nlike this:\n <form action=\"https:\/\/example.com\/tweet\" method=\"POST\">\n   <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"tweet\" value=\"Buy great products at http:\/\/b.com\/#iambad\">\n   <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Click to win!\">\n <\/form> \n\n\n\nNow, if one of your users ends up on the bad guy\u2019s website and hits\nthe \u201cClick to win!\u201d button, the form is submitted to\nyour website, the user is correctly identified by the session ID in\nthe cookie and the hidden Tweet gets published.\nIf our bad guy was even worse, he would make the innocent user submit\nthis form as soon they open his web page using JavaScript, maybe even\ncompletely hidden away in an invisible iframe. This basically is\ncross-site request forgery.\nA form can easily be submitted from everywhere to everywhere.\nGenerally that\u2019s a common feature, but there are many more cases where\nit\u2019s important to only allow a form being submitted from the domain\nwhere it belongs to.\nThings are even worse if your web application doesn\u2019t distinguish\nbetween POST and GET requests (e.g. in PHP by using $_REQUEST instead\nof $_POST). Don\u2019t do that! Data altering requests could be submitted\nas easy as <img src=\"http:\/\/a.com\/tweet?tweet=This+is+really+bad\">,\nembedded in a malicious website or even an email.\nHow do I make sure a form can only be submitted from my own website?\nThis is where the CSRF token comes in. A CSRF token is a random,\nhard-to-guess string. On a page with a form you want to protect, the\nserver would generate a random string, the CSRF token, add it to the\nform as a hidden field and also remember it somehow, either by storing\nit in the session or by setting a cookie containing the value. Now the\nform would look like this:\n    <form action=\"https:\/\/example.com\/tweet\" method=\"POST\">\n      <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"csrf-token\" value=\"nc98P987bcpncYhoadjoiydc9ajDlcn\">\n      <input type=\"text\" name=\"tweet\">\n      <input type=\"submit\">\n    <\/form> \n\n\n\nWhen the user submits the form, the server simply has to compare the\nvalue of the posted field csrf-token (the name doesn\u2019t\nmatter) with the CSRF token remembered by the server. If both strings\nare equal, the server may continue to process the form. Otherwise the\nserver should immediately stop processing the form and respond with an\nerror.\nWhy does this work? There are several reasons why the bad guy from our\nexample above is unable to obtain the CSRF token:\nCopying the static source code from our page to a different website\nwould be useless, because the value of the hidden field changes with\neach user. Without the bad guy\u2019s website knowing the current user\u2019s\nCSRF token your server would always reject the POST request.\nBecause the bad guy\u2019s malicious page is loaded by your user\u2019s browser\nfrom a different domain (b.com instead of a.com), the bad guy has no\nchance to code a JavaScript, that loads the content and therefore our\nuser\u2019s current CSRF token from your website. That is because web\nbrowsers don\u2019t allow cross-domain AJAX requests by default.\nThe bad guy is also unable to access the cookie set by your server,\nbecause the domains wouldn\u2019t match.\nWhen should I protect against cross-site request forgery? If you can\nensure that you don\u2019t mix up GET, POST and other request methods as\ndescribed above, a good start would be to protect all POST requests by\ndefault.\nYou don\u2019t have to protect PUT and DELETE requests, because as\nexplained above, a standard HTML form cannot be submitted by a browser\nusing those methods.\nJavaScript on the other hand can indeed make other types of requests,\ne.g. using jQuery\u2019s $.ajax() function, but remember, for AJAX requests\nto work the domains must match (as long as you don\u2019t explicitly\nconfigure your web server otherwise).\nThis means, often you do not even have to add a CSRF token to AJAX\nrequests, even if they are POST requests, but you will have to make\nsure that you only bypass the CSRF check in your web application if\nthe POST request is actually an AJAX request. You can do that by\nlooking for the presence of a header like X-Requested-With, which AJAX\nrequests usually include. You could also set another custom header and\ncheck for its presence on the server side. That\u2019s safe, because a\nbrowser would not add custom headers to a regular HTML form submission\n(see above), so no chance for Mr Bad Guy to simulate this behaviour\nwith a form.\nIf you\u2019re in doubt about AJAX requests, because for some reason you\ncannot check for a header like X-Requested-With, simply pass the\ngenerated CSRF token to your JavaScript and add the token to the AJAX\nrequest. There are several ways of doing this; either add it to the\npayload just like a regular HTML form would, or add a custom header to\nthe AJAX request. As long as your server knows where to look for it in\nan incoming request and is able to compare it to the original value it\nremembers from the session or cookie, you\u2019re sorted.\n\n","target":0,"question":"How to compare arrays in JavaScript?\n\nI am writing an application (Django, it so happens) and I just want an idea of what actually a \"CSRF token\" is and how it protects the data.\nIs the post data not safe if you do not use CSRF tokens?\n"}

{"question_id":520064,"answer":"I just wanted to add and give some more context on why we have these levels of test, what they really mean with examples\n\nMike Cohn in his book \u201cSucceeding with Agile\u201d came up with the \u201cTesting Pyramid\u201d as a way to approach automated tests in projects. There are various interpretations of this model. The model explains what kind of automated tests need to be created, how fast they can give feedback on the application under test and who writes these tests. \nThere are basically 3 levels of automated testing needed for any project and they are as follows.\n\nUnit Tests-\nThese test the smallest component of your software application. This could literally be one function in a code which computes a value based on some inputs. This function is part of several other functions of the hardware\/software codebase that makes up the application. \n\nFor example - Let\u2019s take a web based calculator application. The smallest components of this application that needs to be unit tested could be a function that performs addition, another that performs subtraction and so on. All these small functions put together makes up the calculator application.\n\nHistorically developer writes these tests as they are usually written in the same programming language as the software application. Unit testing frameworks such as JUnit and NUnit (for java), MSTest (for C# and .NET) and Jasmine\/Mocha (for JavaScript) are used for this purpose.\n\nThe biggest advantage of unit tests are, they run really fast underneath the UI and we can get quick feedback about the application. This should comprise more than 50% of your automated tests.\n\nAPI\/Integration Tests-\nThese test various components of the software system together. The components could include testing databases, API\u2019s (Application Programming Interface), 3rd party tools and services along with the application. \n\nFor example - In our calculator example above, the web application may use a database to store values, use API\u2019s to do some server side validations and it may use a 3rd party tool\/service to publish results to the cloud to make it available across different platforms.\n\nHistorically a developer or technical QA would write these tests using various tools such as Postman, SoapUI, JMeter and other tools like Testim.\n\nThese run much faster than UI tests as they still run underneath the hood but may consume a little more time than unit tests as it has to check the communication between various independent components of the system and ensure they have seamless integration. This should comprise more that 30% of the automated tests.\n\nUI Tests-\nFinally, we have tests that validate the UI of the application. These tests are usually written to test end to end flows through the application. \n\nFor example - In the calculator application, an end to end flow could be, opening up the browser-> Entering the calculator application url  -> Logging in with username\/password -> Opening up the calculator application -> Performing some operations on the calculator -> verifying those results from the UI -> Logging out of the application. This could be one end to end flow that would be a good candidate for UI automation.\n\nHistorically, technical QA\u2019s or manual testers write UI tests. They use open source frameworks like Selenium or UI testing platforms like Testim to author, execute and maintain the tests. These tests give more visual feedback as you can see how the tests are running, the difference between the expected and actual results through screenshots, logs, test reports. \n\nThe biggest limitation of UI tests is, they are relatively slow compared to Unit and API level tests. So, it should comprise only 10-20% of the overall automated tests.\n\nThe next two types of tests can vary based on your project but the idea is-\n\nSmoke Tests\n\nThis can be a combination of the above 3 levels of testing. The idea is to run it during every code check in and ensure the critical functionalities of the system are still working as expected; after the new code changes are merged. They typically need to run with 5 - 10 mins to get faster feedback on failures\n\nRegression Tests\n\nThey usually are run once a day at least and cover various functionalities of the system. They ensure the application is still working as expected. They are more details than the smoke tests and cover more scenarios of the application including the non-critical ones.\n","target":0,"question":"What is the single most influential book every programmer should read?\n\nWhat are unit tests, integration tests, smoke tests, and regression tests?

I leave the rest of my answer for reference.\n\n\n\nIt's not efficient to process images this way. It's better to use single dimension arrays. Processing all pixels is the done in one loop. Random access to points could be done using:\n\npointer + (x + y*width)*(sizeOfOnePixel)\n\n\nIn this particular case, it's better to compute and cache the sum of three pixels groups horizontally because they are used three times each.\n\nI've done some tests and I think it's worth sharing.

{"question_id":319530,"answer":"Tips valid for securing any web application\n\nIf you want to secure your application, then you should definitely start by using HTTPS instead of HTTP, this ensures a creating secure channel between you & the users that will prevent sniffing the data sent back & forth to the users & will help keep the data exchanged confidential.\n\nYou can use JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) to secure RESTful APIs, this has many benefits when compared to the server-side sessions, the benefits are mainly:\n\n1- More scalable, as your API servers will not have to maintain sessions for each user (which can be a big burden when you have many sessions)\n\n2- JWTs are self contained & have the claims which define the user role for example & what he can access & issued at date & expiry date (after which JWT won't be valid)\n\n3- Easier to handle across load-balancers & if you have multiple API servers as you won't have to share session data nor configure server to route the session to same server, whenever a request with a JWT hit any server it can be authenticated & authorized\n\n4- Less pressure on your DB as well as you won't have to constantly store & retrieve session id & data for each request\n\n5- The JWTs can't be tampered with if you use a strong key to sign the JWT, so you can trust the claims in the JWT that is sent with the request without having to check the user session & whether he is authorized or not, you can just check the JWT & then you are all set to know who & what this user can do.\n\nMany libraries provide easy ways to create & validate JWTs in most programming languages, for example: in node.js one of the most popular is jsonwebtoken\n\nSince REST APIs generally aims to keep the server stateless, so JWTs are more compatible with that concept as each request is sent with Authorization token that is self contained (JWT) without the server having to keep track of user session compared to sessions which make the server stateful so that it remembers the user & his role, however, sessions are also widely used & have their pros, which you can search for if you want.\n\nOne important thing to note is that you have to securely deliver the JWT to the client using HTTPS & save it in a secure place (for example in local storage).\n\nYou can learn more about JWTs from this link\n","target":0,"question":"What are these three dots in React doing?\n\nWhat does RESTful Authentication mean and how does it work?

{"question_id":30216000,"answer":"\n  Why is [] faster than list()?\n\n\nThe biggest reason is that Python treats list() just like a user-defined function, which means you can intercept it by aliasing something else to list and do something different (like use your own subclassed list or perhaps a deque). \n\nIt immediately creates a new instance of a builtin list with [].\n\nMy explanation seeks to give you the intuition for this.\n\nExplanation\n\n[] is commonly known as literal syntax. \n\nIn the grammar, this is referred to as a \"list display\". From the docs:\n\n\n  A list display is a possibly empty series of expressions enclosed in\n  square brackets:\n\nlist_display ::=  \"[\" [starred_list | comprehension] \"]\"\n\n  \n  A list display yields a new list object, the contents being specified\n  by either a list of expressions or a comprehension. When a\n  comma-separated list of expressions is supplied, its elements are\n  evaluated from left to right and placed into the list object in that\n  order. When a comprehension is supplied, the list is constructed from\n  the elements resulting from the comprehension.\n\n\nIn short, this means that a builtin object of type list is created. \n\nThere is no circumventing this - which means Python can do it as quickly as it may.\n\nOn the other hand, list() can be intercepted from creating a builtin list using the builtin list constructor.\n\nFor example, say we want our lists to be created noisily:\n\nclass List(list):\n    def __init__(self, iterable=None):\n        if iterable is None:\n            super().__init__()\n        else:\n            super().__init__(iterable)\n        print('List initialized.')\n\n\nWe could then intercept the name list on the module level global scope, and then when we create a list, we actually create our subtyped list:\n\n>>> list = List\n>>> a_list = list()\nList initialized.\n>>> type(a_list)\n<class '__main__.List'>\n\n\nSimilarly we could remove it from the global namespace \n\ndel list\n\n\nand put it in the builtin namespace:\n\nimport builtins\nbuiltins.list = List\n\n\nAnd now:\n\n>>> list_0 = list()\nList initialized.\n>>> type(list_0)\n<class '__main__.List'>\n\n\nAnd note that the list display creates a list unconditionally:\n\n>>> list_1 = []\n>>> type(list_1)\n<class 'list'>\n\n\nWe probably only do this temporarily, so lets undo our changes - first remove the new List object from the builtins:\n\n>>> del builtins.list\n>>> builtins.list\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nAttributeError: module 'builtins' has no attribute 'list'\n>>> list()\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nNameError: name 'list' is not defined\n\n\nOh, no, we lost track of the original. \n\nNot to worry, we can still get list - it's the type of a list literal:\n\n>>> builtins.list = type([])\n>>> list()\n[]\n\n\nSo...\n\n\n  Why is [] faster than list()?\n\n\nAs we've seen - we can overwrite list - but we can't intercept the creation of the literal type. When we use list we have to do the lookups to see if anything is there.\n\nThen we have to call whatever callable we have looked up. From the grammar:\n\n\n  A call calls a callable object (e.g., a function) with a possibly\n  empty series of arguments:\n\ncall                 ::=  primary \"(\" [argument_list [\",\"] | comprehension] \")\"\n\n\n\nWe can see that it does the same thing for any name, not just list:\n\n>>> import dis\n>>> dis.dis('list()')\n  1           0 LOAD_NAME                0 (list)\n              2 CALL_FUNCTION            0\n              4 RETURN_VALUE\n>>> dis.dis('doesnotexist()')\n  1           0 LOAD_NAME                0 (doesnotexist)\n              2 CALL_FUNCTION            0\n              4 RETURN_VALUE\n\n\nFor [] there is no function call at the Python bytecode level:\n\n>>> dis.dis('[]')\n  1           0 BUILD_LIST               0\n              2 RETURN_VALUE\n\n\nIt simply goes straight to building the list without any lookups or calls at the bytecode level.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have demonstrated that list can be intercepted with user code using the scoping rules, and that list() looks for a callable and then calls it.\n\nWhereas [] is a list display, or a literal, and thus avoids the name lookup and function call.\n","target":0,"question":"Convert JavaScript String to be all lowercase\n\nI recently compared the processing speeds of [] and list() and was surprised to discover that [] runs more than three times faster than list(). I ran the same test with {} and dict() and the results were practically identical: [] and {} both took around 0.128sec \/ million cycles, while list() and dict() took roughly 0.428sec \/ million cycles each.\n\nWhy is this? Do [] and {} (and probably () and '', too) immediately pass back a copies of some empty stock literal while their explicitly-named counterparts (list(), dict(), tuple(), str()) fully go about creating an object, whether or not they actually have elements?\n\nI have no idea how these two methods differ but I'd love to find out.\nI couldn't find an answer in the docs or on SO, and searching for empty brackets turned out to be more problematic than I'd expected.\n\nI got my timing results by calling timeit.timeit(\"[]\") and timeit.timeit(\"list()\"), and timeit.timeit(\"{}\") and timeit.timeit(\"dict()\"), to compare lists and dictionaries, respectively.

{"question_id":12159,"answer":"Running multiple threads is not difficult; it is piece of cake. Unfortunately, threads usually need to communicate with each other; that's what's difficult.\nThe mechanism that was originally invented to allow communication between modules was function calls; when module A wants to communicate with module B, it just invokes a function in module B. Unfortunately, this does not work with threads, because when you call a function, that function still runs in the current thread.\nTo overcome this problem, people decided to fall back to an even more primitive mechanism of communication: just declare a certain variable, and let both threads have access to that variable. In other words, allow the threads to share data. Sharing data is literally the first thing that naturally comes to mind, and it appears like a good choice because it seems very simple. I mean, how hard can it be, right? What could possibly go wrong?\nRace conditions. That's what can, and will, go wrong.\nWhen people realized their software was suffering from random, non-reproducible catastrophic failures due to race conditions, they started inventing elaborate mechanisms such as locks and compare-and-swap, aiming to protect against such things happening. These mechanisms fall under the broad category of \"synchronization\". Unfortunately, synchronization has two problems:\n\nIt is very difficult to get it right, so it is very prone to bugs.\nIt is completely untestable, because you cannot test for a race condition.\n\nThe astute reader might notice that \"Very prone to bugs\" and \"Completely untestable\" is a deadly combination.\nNow, the mechanisms I mentioned above were being invented and adopted by large parts of the industry before the concept of automated software testing became prevalent; So, nobody could see how deadly the problem was; they just regarded it as a difficult topic which requires guru programmers, and everyone was okay with that.\nNowadays, whatever we do, we put testing first. So, if some mechanism is untestable, then the use of that mechanism is just out of the question, period. Thus, synchronization has fallen out of grace; very few people still practice it, and they are becoming fewer and fewer every day.\nWithout synchronization threads cannot share data; however, the original requirement was not to share data; it was to allow threads to communicate with each other. Besides sharing data, there exist other, more elegant mechanisms for inter-thread communication.\nOne such mechanism is message-passing, otherwise known as events.\nWith message passing, there is only one place in the entire software system which utilizes synchronization, and that is the concurrent blocking queue collection class that we use for storing messages.

This is incorrect, as the spec says in jls-15.26.2:\n\nA compound assignment expression of the form E1 op= E2 is equivalent to E1 = (T) ((E1) op (E2)), where T is the type of E1, except that E1 is evaluated only once.\n\nSo, for the expression array[i++%size] += i + \" \";, the part array[i++%size] should only be evaluated once. But it is evaluated twice (once for the load, and once for the store).\nSo yes, this is a bug.\n\nSome updates:\nThe bug is fixed in JDK 11 and was back-ported to JDK 10 (here and here), but not to JDK 9, since it no longer receives public updates.\nAleksey Shipilev mentions on the JBS page (and @DidierL in the comments here):\n\nWorkaround: compile with -XDstringConcat=inline\n\nThat will revert to using StringBuilder to do the concatenation, and doesn't have the bug.\n","target":0,"question":"How can I uninstall npm modules in Node.js?\n\nFor a challenge, a fellow code golfer wrote the following code:\nimport java.util.*;\npublic class Main {\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\n    int size = 3;\n    String[] array = new String[size];\n    Arrays.fill(array, \"\");\n    for (int i = 0; i <= 100;) {\n      array[i++ % size] += i + \" \";\n    }\n    for (String element: array) {\n      System.out.println(element);\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nWhen running this code in Java 8, we get the following result:\n1 4 7 10 13 16 19 22 25 28 31 34 37 40 43 46 49 52 55 58 61 64 67 70 73 76 79 82 85 88 91 94 97 100 \n2 5 8 11 14 17 20 23 26 29 32 35 38 41 44 47 50 53 56 59 62 65 68 71 74 77 80 83 86 89 92 95 98 101 \n3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30 33 36 39 42 45 48 51 54 57 60 63 66 69 72 75 78 81 84 87 90 93 96 99 \n\nWhen running this code in Java 10, we get the following result:\n2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 42 44 46 48 50 52 54 56 58 60 62 64 66 68 70 72 74 76 78 80 82 84 86 88 90 92 94 96 98 \n2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 42 44 46 48 50 52 54 56 58 60 62 64 66 68 70 72 74 76 78 80 82 84 86 88 90 92 94 96 98 100 102 \n2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 42 44 46 48 50 52 54 56 58 60 62 64 66 68 70 72 74 76 78 80 82 84 86 88 90 92 94 96 98 100 \n\nThe numbering is entirely off using Java 10.

To enable string concatenation, at least one of the sides must have type String. Trying to reproduce this on other types or constructs failed.\n\n\n"}
{"question_id":1430164,"answer":"I was user of vim first, then I switched to emacs, then to vim, now I'm experimenting with emacs again.\n\n\nBoth are great editors.\nBoth are very extensible today\nBoth have great plugins and community\n\n\nAs developers we type a lot, and, at last for me, moving around in buffers and files are the biggest repetitive tasks, so I want a editor where I CAN MOVE FAST!\n\nThe motivation for experimenting with emacs again is that I fell it Ctrl leaded keybinds faster than vim, and easier to reason about.\n\nIn vim you have modes, you have insertion mode, visual mode, normal mode, what happens when you press something depends on the mode that you are, is a stateful aproach to editing. You move, enter in insert mode, edit, get out of insert mode and move again. I frequently lose my self if I miss a ESC press or something like this.\n\nIn emacs there is no mode, basically you press Ctrl with your pink and type the keystroke, like C-x C-f, C-x C-s, C-x C-c. There are keybinds where you need to release ctrl key, I hate this ones and always replace them by ones with control pressed.\n\nI think that emacs approach is faster to think and type, but vim has another strength, to. Its commands are composable, they usually has a format . For example, to delete a line you can use dd, to delete a word dw. Plugins make use of that felling, with vim-surround plugin you can delete quotes with ds\" (delete surround \"), delete up to next \/ dt\/. Delete up to previous \/: dT\/ and so on. So as long as you learn the moving things start to get very interesting.\n\nSumming up, today I fell that emacs keybinds are faster for macro editing and vim commands are more powerfull for microediting \n\nI've been using vim for the last five years so I edit thinking mainly about words, lines, surrounding, blocks, etc. Delete this line, remove quotes, replace quotes,\ndelete word in cursor, I'm trying to findout the emacs moves for that\n\nAs a final quote I would say that, I care more about fzf than about emacs or vim, I would love to have a editor that is completely fzf based\n","target":0,"question":"Create a tag in a GitHub repository\n\nWhat practical, objective differences are there between Emacs and Vim?

You should be able to adjust the stack size at link time (see ld commands's --stack-size parameter).\nTo give you an idea of approximate stack sizes:\n\n4K on an embedded device\n1M on Win10\n7.4M on Linux\n\nMany C library functions like malloc, memcpy and strlen declare their arguments and return type as size_t.\nsize_t affords the programmer with the ability to deal with different types, by adding\/subtracting the number of elements required instead of using the offset in bytes.\nLet's get a deeper appreciate for what size_t can do for us by examining its usage in pointer arithmetic operations of a C string and an integer array:\nHere's an example using a C string:\nconst char* reverse(char *orig)\n{\n  size_t len = strlen(orig);\n  char *rev = orig + len - 1;\n  while (rev >= orig)\n  {\n    printf(\"%c\", *rev);\n    rev = rev - 1;  \/\/ <= See below\n  }\n  return rev;\n}\n\nint main() {\n  char *string = \"123\";\n  printf(\"%c\", reverse(string));\n}\n\/\/ Output: 321\n\n0x7ff626939004 \"123\"  \/\/ <= orig\n0x7ff626939006 \"3\"    \/\/ <= rev - 1 of 3\n0x7ff626939005 \"23\"   \/\/ <= rev - 2 of 3\n0x7ff626939004 \"123\"  \/\/ <= rev - 3 of 3\n0x7ff6aade9003 \"\"     \/\/ <= rev is indeterminant. This can be exploited as an out of bounds bug to read memory contents that this program has no business reading.\n\nThat's not very helpful in understanding the benefits of using size_t since a character is one byte, regardless of your architecture.\nWhen we're dealing with numerical types, size_t becomes very beneficial.\nsize_t type is like an integer with benefits that can hold a physical memory address; That address changes its size according to the type of platform in which it is executed.\nHere's how we can leverage sizeof and size_t when passing an array of ints:\nvoid print_reverse(int *orig, size_t ary_size)\n{\n  int *rev = orig + ary_size - 1;\n  while (rev >= orig)\n  {\n    printf(\"%i\", *rev);\n    rev = rev - 1;\n  }\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n  int nums[] = {1, 2, 3};\n  print_reverse(nums, sizeof(nums)\/sizeof(*nums));\n\n  return 0;\n}\n\n0x617d3ffb44 1  \/\/ <= orig\n0x617d3ffb4c 3  \/\/ <= rev - 1 of 3\n0x617d3ffb48 2  \/\/ <= rev - 2 of 3\n0x617d3ffb44 1  \/\/ <= rev - 3 of 3\n\nAbove, we see than an int takes 4 bytes (and since there are 8 bits per byte, an int occupies 32 bits).\nIf we were to create an array of longs we'd discover that a long takes 64 bits on a linux64 operating system, but only 32 bits on a Win64 system.  Hence, using t_size, will save a lot of coding and potential bugs, especially when running C code that performs Address Arithmetic on different architectures.\nSo the moral of this story is \"Use size_t and let your C-compiler do the error-prone work of pointer arithmetic.\"\n","target":0,"question":"How do I create multiline comments in Python?\n\nI am getting confused with size_t in C.

{"question_id":36314,"answer":"Most of the examples in this thread are contrived (adding numbers). These are useful for illustrating the concept, but don't motivate when you might actually use currying in an app.\nHere's a practical example from React, the JavaScript user interface library. Currying here illustrates the closure property.\nAs is typical in most user interface libraries, when the user clicks a button, a function is called to handle the event. The handler typically modifies the application's state and triggers the interface to re-render.\nLists of items are common user interface components. Each item might have an identifier associated with it (usually related to a database record). When the user clicks a button to, for example, \"like\" an item in the list, the handler needs to know which button was clicked.\nCurrying is one approach for achieving the binding between id and handler. In the code below, makeClickHandler is a function that accepts an id and returns a handler function that has the id in its scope.\nThe inner function's workings aren't important for this discussion. But if you're curious, it searches through the array of items to find an item by id and increments its \"likes\", triggering another render by setting the state. State is immutable in React so it takes a bit more work to modify the one value than you might expect.\nYou can think of invoking the curried function as \"stripping\" off the outer function to expose an inner function ready to be called. That new inner function is the actual handler passed to React's onClick. The outer function is there for the loop body to specify the id that will be in scope of a particular inner handler function.\n\r\n\r\nconst List = () => {\n  const [items, setItems] = React.useState([\n    {name: \"foo\", likes: 0},\n    {name: \"bar\", likes: 0},\n    {name: \"baz\", likes: 0},\n  ].map(e => ({...e, id: crypto.randomUUID()})));\n\n  \/\/    .----------.   outer func  inner func\n  \/\/    | currying |         |       |\n  \/\/    `----------`         V       V\n  const makeClickHandler = (id) => (event) => {\n    setItems(prev => {\n      const i = prev.findIndex(e => e.id === id);\n      const cpy = {...prev[i]};\n      cpy.likes++;\n      return [\n        ...prev.slice(0, i),\n        cpy,\n        ...prev.slice(i + 1)\n      ];\n    });\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <ul>\n    {items.map(({name, likes, id}) =>\n      <li key={id}>\n        <button\n          onClick={\n            \/* strip off first function layer to get a click\n               handler  bound to `id` and pass it to onClick *\/\n            makeClickHandler(id)\n          }\n        >\n          {name} ({likes} likes)\n        <\/button>\n      <\/li>\n    )}\n    <\/ul>\n  );\n};\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <List \/>,\n  document.querySelector(\"#root\")\n);\r\nbutton {\n  font-family: monospace;\n  font-size: 2em;\n}\r\n<script src=\"https:\/\/cdnjs.cloudflare.com\/ajax\/libs\/babel-standalone\/6.26.0\/babel.min.js\"><\/script>\n<script src=\"https:\/\/cdnjs.cloudflare.com\/ajax\/libs\/react\/17.0.2\/umd\/react.production.min.js\"><\/script>\n<script src=\"https:\/\/cdnjs.cloudflare.com\/ajax\/libs\/react-dom\/17.0.2\/umd\/react-dom.production.min.js\"><\/script>\n<div id=\"root\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\n","target":0,"question":"Check if table exists in SQL Server\n\nI've seen references to curried functions in several articles and blogs but I can't find a good explanation (or at least one that makes sense!)\n"}

{"question_id":2870992,"answer":"One point missed in the existing answers is show how to inherit the error traps. The bash shell provides one such option for that using set\n\n-E\nIf set, any trap on ERR is inherited by shell functions, command substitutions, and commands executed in a subshell environment. The ERR trap is normally not inherited in such cases.\n\n\nAdam Rosenfield's answer recommendation to use set -e is right in certain cases but it has its own potential pitfalls. See GreyCat's BashFAQ - 105 - Why doesn't set -e (or set -o errexit, or trap ERR) do what I expected?\nAccording to the manual, set -e exits\n\nif a simple commandexits with a non-zero status. The shell does not exit if the command that fails is part of the command list immediately following a while or until keyword, part of the test in a if statement, part of an && or || list except the command following the final && or ||, any command in a pipeline but the last, or if the command's return value is being inverted via !\".\n\nwhich means, set -e does not work under the following simple cases (detailed explanations can be found on the wiki)\n\nUsing the arithmetic operator let or $((..)) ( bash 4.1 onwards) to increment a variable value as\n#!\/usr\/bin\/env bash\nset -e\ni=0\nlet i++                   # or ((i++)) on bash 4.1 or later\necho \"i is $i\" \n\n\nIf the offending command is not part of the last command executed via && or ||.  For e.g. the below trap wouldn't fire when its expected to\n#!\/usr\/bin\/env bash\nset -e\ntest -d nosuchdir && echo no dir\necho survived\n\n\nWhen used incorrectly in an if statement as, the exit code of the if statement is the exit code of the last executed command. In the example below the last executed command was echo which wouldn't fire the trap, even though the test -d failed\n#!\/usr\/bin\/env bash\nset -e\nf() { if test -d nosuchdir; then echo no dir; fi; }\nf \necho survived\n\n\nWhen used with command-substitution, they are ignored, unless inherit_errexit is set with bash 4.4\n#!\/usr\/bin\/env bash\nset -e\nfoo=$(expr 1-1; true)\necho survived\n\n\nwhen you use commands that look like assignments but aren't, such as export, declare, typeset or local. Here the function call to f will not exit as local has swept the error code that was set previously.\nset -e\nf() { local var=$(somecommand that fails); }        \ng() { local var; var=$(somecommand that fails); }\n\n\nWhen used in a pipeline, and the offending command is not part of the last command. For e.g. the below command would still go through. One options is to enable pipefail by returning the exit code of the first failed process:\nset -e\nsomecommand that fails | cat -\necho survived\n\n\n\nThe ideal recommendation is to not use set -e and implement an own version of error checking instead.

{"question_id":9032856,"answer":"To buttress what has been shared earlier.\n\nThe underlying cause of this behaviour is partly due to the weakly-typed nature of JavaScript. For example, the expression 1 + \u201c2\u201d is ambiguous since there are two possible interpretations based on the operand types (int, string) and (int int):\n\n\nUser intends to concatenate two strings, result: \u201c12\u201d\nUser intends to add two numbers, result: 3\n\n\nThus with varying input types,the output possibilities increase.\n\nThe addition algorithm \n\n\nCoerce operands to primitive values\n\n\nThe JavaScript primitives are string, number, null, undefined and boolean (Symbol is coming soon in ES6). Any other value is an object (e.g. arrays, functions and objects). The coercion process for converting objects into primitive values is described thus:\n\n\nIf a primitive value is returned when object.valueOf() is invoked, then return this value, otherwise continue\nIf a primitive value is returned when object.toString() is invoked, then return this value, otherwise continue\nThrow a TypeError\n\n\nNote: For date values, the order is to invoke toString before valueOf.\n\n\nIf any operand value is a string, then do a string concatenation\nOtherwise, convert both operands to their numeric value and then add these values\n\n\nKnowing the various coercion values of types in JavaScript does help to make the confusing outputs clearer. See the coercion table below\n\n+-----------------+-------------------+---------------+\n| Primitive Value |   String value    | Numeric value |\n+-----------------+-------------------+---------------+\n| null            | \u201cnull\u201d            | 0             |\n| undefined       | \u201cundefined\u201d       | NaN           |\n| true            | \u201ctrue\u201d            | 1             |\n| false           | \u201cfalse\u201d           | 0             |\n| 123             | \u201c123\u201d             | 123           |\n| []              | \u201c\u201d                | 0             |\n| {}              | \u201c[object Object]\u201d | NaN           |\n+-----------------+-------------------+---------------+\n\n\nIt is also good to know that JavaScript's + operator is left-associative as this determines what the output will be cases involving more than one + operation.\n\nLeveraging the \nThus 1 + \"2\" will give \"12\" because any addition involving a string will always default to string concatenation.\n\nYou can read more examples in this blog post (disclaimer I wrote it).\n","target":0,"question":"In Python, how do I determine if an object is iterable?\n\nThe 'Wat' talk for CodeMash 2012 basically points out a few bizarre quirks with Ruby and JavaScript.\n\nI have made a JSFiddle of the results at http:\/\/jsfiddle.net\/fe479\/9\/.\n\nThe behaviours specific to JavaScript (as I don't know Ruby) are listed below.\n\nI found in the JSFiddle that some of my results didn't correspond with those in the video, and I am not sure why.

{"question_id":1520429,"answer":"Excellent answers all around, but I think I can add something that worked for me in a practical scenario: exploiting the aria-label attribute for CSS.\nFor the readers that don't know: aria-label is an attribute that is used in conjunction with other similar attributes to let a screen-reader know what something is, in case someone with a visual impairment is using your website. Many websites add these attributes to elements with images or text in them, as \"descriptors\".\nThis makes it highly website-specific, but in case your element contains this, it's fairly simple to select that element using the content of the attribute:\nHTML:\n<td aria-label=\"male\">Male<\/td>\n<td aria-label=\"female\">Female<\/td>\n\nCSS:\ntd[aria-label=\"male\"] {\n    outline: 1px dotted green;\n}\n\nThis is technically the same thing as using the data-attribute solution, but this will work for you if you are not the author of the website, plus this is not some out-of-the-way solution that is specifically designed to support this use case; it's fairly common on its own.

{"question_id":34361379,"answer":"They are not always equivalent. Here's a case where you cannot simply use arrow functions instead of regular functions.\nArrow functions CANNOT be used as constructors\nTLDR:\nThis is because of how Arrow Functions use the this keyword. JS will simply throw an error if it sees an arrow function being invoked as a \"constructor\". Use regular functions to fix the error.\nLonger explanation:\nThis is because objects \"constructors\" rely on the this keyword to be able to be modified.\nGenerally, the this keyword always references the global object. (In the browser it is the window object).\nBUT, when you do something like:\nfunction personCreator(name) {\n   this.name = name;\n}\n\nconst person1 = new personCreator('John');\n\nThe new keyword do some of its magic and makes the this keyword that is inside of personCreator to be initially an empty object instead of referencing the global object. After that, a new property called name is created inside that empty this object, and its value will be 'John'. At the end, the this object is returned.\nAs we see, the new keyword changed the value of this from referencing the global object to now be an empty object {}.\nArrow functions do not allow their this object to be modified. Their this object is always the one from the scope where they were statically created. This is called Static Lexical Scope. That is why you cannot do operations like bind, apply, or call with arrow functions. Simply, their this is locked to the value of the this of the scope were they were created. This is by design.\nAnd because of this :D, arrow functions cannot be used as \"constructors\".\nSide Note:\nA lexical scope is just the area where a function is created. For example:\nfunction personCreator(name) {\n    this.name = name;\n\n    const foo = () => {\n        const bar = () => {\n            console.log(this); \/\/ Output: { name: 'John' }\n        }\n\n        console.log(this); \/\/ Output: { name: 'John' }\n    \n        bar();\n    }\n\n    foo();\n}\n\nconst person1 = new personCreator('John');\n\nThe lexical scope of bar is everything that is within foo. So, the this value of bar is the one that foo has, which is the one of personCreator.\n","target":0,"question":"How do I determine the size of my array in C?\n\nArrow functions in ES2015 provide a more concise syntax. \n\n\nCan I replace all my function declarations \/ expressions with arrow functions now? \nWhat do I have to look out for?\n\n\nExamples:\n\nConstructor function\n\nfunction User(name) {\n  this.name = name;\n}\n\n\/\/ vs\n\nconst User = name => {\n  this.name = name;\n};\n\n\nPrototype methods\n\nUser.prototype.getName = function() {\n  return this.name;\n};\n\n\/\/ vs\n\nUser.prototype.getName = () => this.name;\n\n\nObject (literal) methods\n\nconst obj = {\n  getName: function() {\n    \/\/ ...\n  }\n};\n\n\/\/ vs\n\nconst obj = {\n  getName: () => {\n    \/\/ ...\n  }\n};\n\n\nCallbacks\n\nsetTimeout(function() {\n  \/\/ ...\n}, 500);\n\n\/\/ vs\n\nsetTimeout(() => {\n  \/\/ ...\n}, 500);\n\n\nVariadic functions\n\nfunction sum() {\n  let args = [].slice.call(arguments);\n  \/\/ ...\n}\n\n\/\/ vs\nconst sum = (...args) => {\n  \/\/ ...\n};\n\n"}
{"question_id":2089271,"answer":"A CGI script is a console\/shell program. In Windows, when you use a \"Command Prompt\" window, you execute console programs. When a web server executes a CGI script it provides input to the console\/shell program using environment variables or \"standard input\". Standard input is like typing data into a console\/shell program; in the case of a CGI script, the web server does the typing. The CGI script writes data out to \"standard output\" and that output is sent to the client (the web browser) as a HTML page. Standard output is like the output you see in a console\/shell program except the web server reads it and sends it out.\n\nA CGI script can be executed from a browser. The URI typically includes a query string that is provided to the CGI script. If the method is \"get\" then the query string is provided to the CGI Script in an environment variable called QUERY_STRING. If the method is \"post\" then the query string is provided to the CGI Script using standard input (the CGI Script reads the query string from standard input).\n\nAn early use of CGI scripts was to process forms. In the beginning of HTML, HTML forms typically had an \"action\" attribute and a button designated as the \"submit\" button. When the submit button is pushed the URI specified in the \"action\" attribute would be sent to the server with the data from the form sent as a query string. If the \"action\" specifies a CGI script then the CGI script would be executed and it then produces a HTML page.\n\nRFC 3875 \"The Common Gateway Interface (CGI)\" partially defines CGI using C, as in saying that environment variables \"are accessed by the C library routine getenv() or variable environ\".\n\nIf you are developing a CGI script using C\/C++ and use Microsoft Visual Studio to do that then you would develop a console program. \n","target":0,"question":"How should I ethically approach user password storage for later plaintext retrieval?\n\nCGI is a Common Gateway Interface. As the name says, it is a \"common\" gateway interface for everything. It is so trivial and naive from the name. I feel that I understood this and I felt this every time I encountered this word. But frankly, I didn't. I'm still confused. \n\nI am a PHP programmer with web development experience. \n\n\n  user (client) request for page ---> webserver(->embedded PHP\n  interpreter) ----> Server side(PHP) Script ---> MySQL Server.\n\n\nNow say my PHP Script can fetch results from MySQL server & MATLAB server & some other server.\n\nSo, now PHP Script is the CGI? Because its interface for the between webserver & All other servers? I don't know. Sometimes they call CGI, a technology & other times they call CGI a program or some other server. \n\n\nWhat exactly is CGI?\nWhats the big deal with \/cgi-bin\/*.cgi? What's up with this? I don't know what is this cgi-bin directory on the server for. I don't know why they have *.cgi extensions.\nWhy does Perl always comes in the way. CGI & Perl (language). I also don't know what's up with these two. Almost all the time I keep hearing these two in combination \"CGI & Perl\". This book is another great example CGI Programming with Perl. Why not \"CGI Programming with PHP\/JSP\/ASP\"? I never saw such things. \nCGI Programming in C, confuses me a lot. \"in C\"?? Seriously?? I don't know what to say. I'm just confused. \"in C\"?? This changes everything. Program needs to be compiled and executed. This entirely changes my view of web programming. When do I compile? How does the program gets executed (because it will be a machine code, so it must execute as a independent process). How does it communicate with the web server? IPC? and interfacing with all the servers (in my example MATLAB & MySQL) using socket programming? I'm lost!!\nPeople say that CGI is deprecated and isn't in use anymore. Is that so? What is the latest update?\n\n\n\n  Once, I ran into a situation where I\n  had to give HTTP PUT request access to\n  web server (Apache HTTPD). Its a long\n  back. So, as far as I remember this is\n  what I did:\n  \n  \n  Edited the configuration file of Apache HTTPD to tell webserver to pass\n  all HTTP PUT requests to some\n  put.php ( I had to write this PHP\n  script)\n  Implement put.php to handle the request (save the file to the location\n  mentioned)\n  \n  \n  People said that I wrote a CGI Script.\n  Seriously, I didn't have a clue what\n  they were talking about.\n\n\n\nDid I really write CGI Script?  \n\n\nI hope you understood what my confusion is. (Because I myself don't know where I'm confused). I request you guys to keep your answer as simple as possible. I really can't understand any fancy technical terminology. At least not in this case. \n\nEDIT:\n\nI found this amazing tutorial \"CGI Programming Is Simple!\" - CGI Tutorial, which explains the concepts in simplest possible way.

{"question_id":3988788,"answer":"To understand the name: A stack trace is a a list of Exceptions( or you can say a list of \"Cause by\"), from the most surface Exception(e.g. Service Layer Exception) to the deepest one (e.g. Database Exception). Just like the reason we call it 'stack' is because stack is First in Last out (FILO), the deepest exception was happened in the very beginning, then a chain of exception was generated a series of consequences, the surface Exception was the last one happened in time, but we see it in the first place.\n\nKey 1:A tricky and important thing here need to be understand is : the deepest cause may not be the \"root cause\", because if you write some \"bad code\", it may cause some exception underneath which is deeper than its layer. For example, a bad sql query may cause SQLServerException connection reset in the bottem instead of syndax error, which may just in the middle of the stack.\n\n-> Locate the root cause in the middle is your job.\n\n\nKey 2:Another tricky but important thing is inside each \"Cause by\" block, the first line was the deepest layer and happen first place for this block. For instance,\n\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.NullPointerException\n        at com.example.myproject.Book.getTitle(Book.java:16)\n           at com.example.myproject.Author.getBookTitles(Author.java:25)\n               at com.example.myproject.Bootstrap.main(Bootstrap.java:14)\n\n\nBook.java:16 was called by Auther.java:25 which was called by Bootstrap.java:14, Book.java:16 was the root cause.\nHere attach a diagram sort the trace stack in chronological order.\n\n","target":0,"question":"Difference between \"wait()\" vs \"sleep()\" in Java\n\nSometimes when I run my application it gives me an error that looks like:\n\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.NullPointerException\n        at com.example.myproject.Book.getTitle(Book.java:16)\n        at com.example.myproject.Author.getBookTitles(Author.java:25)\n        at com.example.myproject.Bootstrap.main(Bootstrap.java:14)\n\n\nPeople have referred to this as a \"stack trace\". What is a stack trace? What can it tell me about the error that's happening in my program?\n\n\n\nAbout this question - quite often I see a question come through where a novice programmer is \"getting an error\", and they simply paste their stack trace and some random block of code without understanding what the stack trace is or how they can use it. This question is intended as a reference for novice programmers who might need help understanding the value of a stack trace.\n"}

{"question_id":256222,"answer":"You would most likely use ValueError (raise ValueError() in full) in this case, but it depends on the type of bad value.

It has a powerful WHEN MATCHED vs WHEN NOT MATCHED structure that gives the ability to  INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE  on such conditions.\nIt not only eases bulk changes, but it even adds more control that tradition UPSERT and INSERT ... ON CONFLICT\nTake a look at this very complete sample from official page:\nMERGE INTO wines w\nUSING wine_stock_changes s\nON s.winename = w.winename\nWHEN NOT MATCHED AND s.stock_delta > 0 THEN\n  INSERT VALUES(s.winename, s.stock_delta)\nWHEN MATCHED AND w.stock + s.stock_delta > 0 THEN\n  UPDATE SET stock = w.stock + s.stock_delta\nWHEN MATCHED THEN\n  DELETE;\n\nPostgreSQL  v9, v10, v11, v12, v13, v14\nIf version is under v15 and over v9.5 , probably best choice is to use UPSERT syntax, with ON CONFLICT clause\n","target":0,"question":"How do I create a constant in Python?\n\nSeveral months ago I learned from an answer on Stack Overflow how to perform multiple updates at once in MySQL using the following syntax:\n\nINSERT INTO table (id, field, field2) VALUES (1, A, X), (2, B, Y), (3, C, Z)\nON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE field=VALUES(Col1), field2=VALUES(Col2);\n\n\nI've now switched over to PostgreSQL and apparently this is not correct.

{"question_id":12748246,"answer":"Here is a generalized solution to this kind of problem:\n\nGeneral procedure\n\nThe taken approach is as follows. The algorithm operates on a single buffer of 32-bit words. It performs the following procedure in a loop:\n\n\nWe start with a buffer filled with compressed data from the last iteration. The buffer looks like this \n\n|compressed sorted|empty|\nCalculate the maximum amount of numbers that can be stored in this buffer, both compressed and uncompressed. Split the buffer into these two sections, beginning with the space for compressed data, ending with the uncompressed data. The buffer looks like \n\n|compressed sorted|empty|empty|\nFill the uncompressed section with numbers to be sorted. The buffer looks like \n\n|compressed sorted|empty|uncompressed unsorted|\nSort the new numbers with an in-place sort. The buffer looks like \n\n|compressed sorted|empty|uncompressed sorted|\nRight-align any already compressed data from the previous iteration in the compressed section. At this point the buffer is partitioned \n\n|empty|compressed sorted|uncompressed sorted|\nPerform a streaming decompression-recompression on the compressed section, merging in the sorted data in the uncompressed section. The old compressed section is consumed as the new compressed section grows. The buffer looks like \n\n|compressed sorted|empty|\n\n\nThis procedure is performed until all numbers have been sorted.\n\nCompression\n\nThis algorithm of course only works when it's possible to calculate the final compressed size of the new sorting buffer before actually knowing what will actually be compressed. Next to that, the compression algorithm needs to be good enough to solve the actual problem.\n\nThe used approach uses three steps. First, the algorithm will always store sorted sequences, therefore we can instead store purely the differences between consecutive entries. Each difference is in the range [0, 99999999].\n\nThese differences are then encoded as a unary bitstream. A 1 in this stream means \"Add 1 to the accumulator, A 0 means \"Emit the accumulator as an entry, and reset\". So difference N will be represented by N 1's and one 0.\n\nThe sum of all differences will approach the maximum value that the algorithm supports, and the count of all differences will approach the amount of values inserted in the algorithm. This means we expect the stream to, at the end, contain max value 1's and count 0's. This allows us to calculate the expected probability of a 0 and 1 in the stream. Namely, the probability of a 0 is count\/(count+maxval) and the probability of a 1 is maxval\/(count+maxval).\n\nWe use these probabilities to define an arithmetic coding model over this bitstream. This arithmetic code will encode exactly this amounts of 1's and 0's in optimal space. We can calculate the space used by this model for any intermediate bitstream as: bits = encoded * log2(1 + amount \/ maxval) + maxval * log2(1 + maxval \/ amount). To calculate the total required space for the algorithm, set encoded equal to amount.\n\nTo not require a ridiculous amount of iterations, a small overhead can be added to the buffer. This will ensure that the algorithm will at least operate on the amount of numbers that fit in this overhead, as by far the largest time cost of the algorithm is the arithmetic coding compression and decompression each cycle.\n\nNext to that, some overhead is necessary to store bookkeeping data and to handle slight inaccuracies in the fixed-point approximation of the arithmetic coding algorithm, but in total the algorithm is able to fit in 1MiB of space even with an extra buffer that can contain 8000 numbers, for a total of 1043916 bytes of space.\n\nOptimality\n\nOutside of reducing the (small) overhead of the algorithm it should be theoretically impossible to get a smaller result. To just contain the entropy of the final result, 1011717 bytes would be necessary. If we subtract the extra buffer added for efficiency this algorithm used 1011916 bytes to store the final result + overhead.\n","target":0,"question":"How do I copy a version of a single file from one Git branch to another?\n\nI have a computer with 1 MB of RAM and no other local storage.

{"question_id":5741187,"answer":"\n\n\n  TL;DR\n  \n  mysql_real_escape_string() will provide no protection whatsoever (and could furthermore munge your data) if:\n  \n  \n  MySQL's NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES SQL mode is enabled (which it might be, unless you explicitly select another SQL mode every time you connect); and\n  your SQL string literals are quoted using double-quote \" characters.\n  \n  \n  This was filed as bug #72458 and has been fixed in MySQL v5.7.6 (see the section headed \"The Saving Grace\", below).\n\n\nThis is another, (perhaps less?) obscure EDGE CASE!!!\n\nIn homage to @ircmaxell's excellent answer (really, this is supposed to be flattery and not plagiarism!), I will adopt his format:\n\nThe Attack\n\nStarting off with a demonstration...\n\nmysql_query('SET SQL_MODE=\"NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES\"'); \/\/ could already be set\n$var = mysql_real_escape_string('\" OR 1=1 -- ');\nmysql_query('SELECT * FROM test WHERE name = \"'.$var.'\" LIMIT 1');\n\n\nThis will return all records from the test table.  A dissection:\n\n\nSelecting an SQL Mode\n\nmysql_query('SET SQL_MODE=\"NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES\"');\n\n\nAs documented under String Literals:\n\n\n  There are several ways to include quote characters within a string:\n  \n  \n  A \u201c'\u201d inside a string quoted with \u201c'\u201d may be written as \u201c''\u201d.\n  A \u201c\"\u201d inside a string quoted with \u201c\"\u201d may be written as \u201c\"\"\u201d.\n  Precede the quote character by an escape character (\u201c\\\u201d).\n  A \u201c'\u201d inside a string quoted with \u201c\"\u201d needs no special treatment and need not be doubled or escaped. In the same way, \u201c\"\u201d inside a string quoted with \u201c'\u201d needs no special treatment.\n  \n\n\nIf the server's SQL mode includes NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES, then the third of these options\u2014which is the usual approach adopted by mysql_real_escape_string()\u2014is not available: one of the first two options must be used instead.  Note that the effect of the fourth bullet is that one must necessarily know the character that will be used to quote the literal in order to avoid munging one's data.\nThe Payload\n\n\" OR 1=1 -- \n\n\nThe payload initiates this injection quite literally with the \" character.  No particular encoding.  No special characters.  No weird bytes.\nmysql_real_escape_string()\n\n$var = mysql_real_escape_string('\" OR 1=1 -- ');\n\n\nFortunately, mysql_real_escape_string() does check the SQL mode and adjust its behaviour accordingly.  See libmysql.c:\n\nulong STDCALL\nmysql_real_escape_string(MYSQL *mysql, char *to,const char *from,\n             ulong length)\n{\n  if (mysql->server_status & SERVER_STATUS_NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES)\n    return escape_quotes_for_mysql(mysql->charset, to, 0, from, length);\n  return escape_string_for_mysql(mysql->charset, to, 0, from, length);\n}\n\n\nThus a different underlying function, escape_quotes_for_mysql(), is invoked if the NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES SQL mode is in use.  As mentioned above, such a function needs to know which character will be used to quote the literal in order to repeat it without causing the other quotation character from being repeated literally.\n\nHowever, this function arbitrarily assumes that the string will be quoted using the single-quote ' character.  See charset.c:\n\n\/*\n  Escape apostrophes by doubling them up\n\n\/\/ [ deletia 839-845 ]\n\n  DESCRIPTION\n    This escapes the contents of a string by doubling up any apostrophes that\n    it contains. This is used when the NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES SQL_MODE is in\n    effect on the server.\n\n\/\/ [ deletia 852-858 ]\n*\/\n\nsize_t escape_quotes_for_mysql(CHARSET_INFO *charset_info,\n                               char *to, size_t to_length,\n                               const char *from, size_t length)\n{\n\/\/ [ deletia 865-892 ]\n\n    if (*from == '\\'')\n    {\n      if (to + 2 > to_end)\n      {\n        overflow= TRUE;\n        break;\n      }\n      *to++= '\\'';\n      *to++= '\\'';\n    }\n\n\nSo, it leaves double-quote \" characters untouched (and doubles all single-quote ' characters) irrespective of the actual character that is used to quote the literal!  In our case $var remains exactly the same as the argument that was provided to mysql_real_escape_string()\u2014it's as though no escaping has taken place at all.\nThe Query\n\nmysql_query('SELECT * FROM test WHERE name = \"'.$var.'\" LIMIT 1');\n\n\nSomething of a formality, the rendered query is:\n\nSELECT * FROM test WHERE name = \"\" OR 1=1 -- \" LIMIT 1\n\n\n\nAs my learned friend put it: congratulations, you just successfully attacked a program using mysql_real_escape_string()...\n\nThe Bad\n\nmysql_set_charset() cannot help, as this has nothing to do with character sets; nor can mysqli::real_escape_string(), since that's just a different wrapper around this same function.\n\nThe problem, if not already obvious, is that the call to mysql_real_escape_string() cannot know with which character the literal will be quoted, as that's left to the developer to decide at a later time.  So, in NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES mode, there is literally no way that this function can safely escape every input for use with arbitrary quoting (at least, not without doubling characters that do not require doubling and thus munging your data).\n\nThe Ugly\n\nIt gets worse.  NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES may not be all that uncommon in the wild owing to the necessity of its use for compatibility with standard SQL (e.g. see section 5.3 of the SQL-92 specification, namely the <quote symbol> ::= <quote><quote> grammar production and lack of any special meaning given to backslash).  Furthermore, its use was explicitly recommended as a workaround to the (long since fixed) bug that ircmaxell's post describes.  Who knows, some DBAs might even configure it to be on by default as means of discouraging use of incorrect escaping methods like addslashes().\n\nAlso, the SQL mode of a new connection is set by the server according to its configuration (which a SUPER user can change at any time); thus, to be certain of the server's behaviour, you must always explicitly specify your desired mode after connecting.\n\nThe Saving Grace\n\nSo long as you always explicitly set the SQL mode not to include NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES, or quote MySQL string literals using the single-quote character, this bug cannot rear its ugly head: respectively escape_quotes_for_mysql() will not be used, or its assumption about which quote characters require repeating will be correct.\n\nFor this reason, I recommend that anyone using NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES also enables ANSI_QUOTES mode, as it will force habitual use of single-quoted string literals.  Note that this does not prevent SQL injection in the event that double-quoted literals happen to be used\u2014it merely reduces the likelihood of that happening (because normal, non-malicious queries would fail).\n\nIn PDO, both its equivalent function PDO::quote() and its prepared statement emulator call upon mysql_handle_quoter()\u2014which does exactly this: it ensures that the escaped literal is quoted in single-quotes, so you can be certain that PDO is always immune from this bug.\n\nAs of MySQL v5.7.6, this bug has been fixed.  See change log:\n\n\n  Functionality Added or Changed\n  \n  \n  Incompatible Change: A new C API function, mysql_real_escape_string_quote(), has been implemented as a replacement for mysql_real_escape_string() because the latter function can fail to properly encode characters when the NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES SQL mode is enabled. In this case, mysql_real_escape_string() cannot escape quote characters except by doubling them, and to do this properly, it must know more information about the quoting context than is available. mysql_real_escape_string_quote() takes an extra argument for specifying the quoting context. For usage details, see mysql_real_escape_string_quote().\n  \n  \n    \u00a0Note\n    \n    Applications should be modified to use mysql_real_escape_string_quote(), instead of mysql_real_escape_string(), which now fails and produces an CR_INSECURE_API_ERR error if NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES is enabled.\n  \n  \n  References: See also Bug #19211994.\n  \n\n\nSafe Examples\n\nTaken together with the bug explained by ircmaxell, the following examples are entirely safe (assuming that one is either using MySQL later than 4.1.20, 5.0.22, 5.1.11; or that one is not using a GBK\/Big5 connection encoding):\n\nmysql_set_charset($charset);\nmysql_query(\"SET SQL_MODE=''\");\n$var = mysql_real_escape_string('\" OR 1=1 \/*');\nmysql_query('SELECT * FROM test WHERE name = \"'.$var.'\" LIMIT 1');\n\n\n...because we've explicitly selected an SQL mode that doesn't include NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES.\n\nmysql_set_charset($charset);\n$var = mysql_real_escape_string(\"' OR 1=1 \/*\");\nmysql_query(\"SELECT * FROM test WHERE name = '$var' LIMIT 1\");\n\n\n...because we're quoting our string literal with single-quotes.\n\n$stmt = $pdo->prepare('SELECT * FROM test WHERE name = ? LIMIT 1');\n$stmt->execute([\"' OR 1=1 \/*\"]);\n\n\n...because PDO prepared statements are immune from this vulnerability (and ircmaxell's too, provided either that you're using PHP\u22655.3.6 and the character set has been correctly set in the DSN; or that prepared statement emulation has been disabled).\n\n$var  = $pdo->quote(\"' OR 1=1 \/*\");\n$stmt = $pdo->query(\"SELECT * FROM test WHERE name = $var LIMIT 1\");\n\n\n...because PDO's quote() function not only escapes the literal, but also quotes it (in single-quote ' characters); note that to avoid ircmaxell's bug in this case, you must be using PHP\u22655.3.6 and have correctly set the character set in the DSN.\n\n$stmt = $mysqli->prepare('SELECT * FROM test WHERE name = ? LIMIT 1');\n$param = \"' OR 1=1 \/*\";\n$stmt->bind_param('s', $param);\n$stmt->execute();\n\n\n...because MySQLi prepared statements are safe.\n\nWrapping Up\n\nThus, if you:\n\n\nuse native prepared statements\n\n\nOR\n\n\nuse MySQL v5.7.6 or later\n\n\nOR\n\n\nin addition to employing one of the solutions in ircmaxell's summary, use at least one of:\n\n\nPDO;\nsingle-quoted string literals; or\nan explicitly set SQL mode that does not include NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES\n\n\n\n...then you should be completely safe (vulnerabilities outside the scope of string escaping aside).\n","target":0,"question":"Easy interview question got harder: given numbers 1..100, find the missing number(s) given exactly k are missing\n\nIs there an SQL injection possibility even when using mysql_real_escape_string() function?\n\nConsider this sample situation.

I do not want to convert my entire application to timezone unaware for this one legacy case.\nWhat I've Tried\nFirst, to demonstrate the problem:\nPython 2.6.1 (r261:67515, Jun 24 2010, 21:47:49) \n[GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5646)] on darwin\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> import datetime\n>>> import pytz\n>>> unaware = datetime.datetime(2011,8,15,8,15,12,0)\n>>> unaware\ndatetime.datetime(2011, 8, 15, 8, 15, 12)\n>>> aware = datetime.datetime(2011,8,15,8,15,12,0,pytz.UTC)\n>>> aware\ndatetime.datetime(2011, 8, 15, 8, 15, 12, tzinfo=<UTC>)\n>>> aware == unaware\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nTypeError: can't compare offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes\n\nFirst, I tried astimezone:\n>>> unaware.astimezone(pytz.UTC)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nValueError: astimezone() cannot be applied to a naive datetime\n>>>\n\nIt's not terribly surprising this failed, since it's actually trying to do a conversion.  Replace seemed like a better choice (as per How do I get a value of datetime.today() in Python that is \"timezone aware\"?):\n>>> unaware.replace(tzinfo=pytz.UTC)\ndatetime.datetime(2011, 8, 15, 8, 15, 12, tzinfo=<UTC>)\n>>> unaware == aware\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nTypeError: can't compare offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes\n>>> \n\nBut as you can see, replace seems to set the tzinfo, but not make the object aware.  I'm getting ready to fall back to doctoring the input string to have a timezone before parsing it (I'm using dateutil for parsing, if that matters), but that seems incredibly kludgy.\nAlso, I've tried this in both Python 2.6 and Python 2.7, with the same results.\nContext\nI am writing a parser for some data files. There is an old format I need to support where the date string does not have a timezone indicator. I've already fixed the data source, but I still need to support the legacy data format. A one time conversion of the legacy data is not an option for various business BS reasons. While in general, I do not like the idea of hard-coding a default timezone, in this case it seems like the best option. I know with reasonable confidence that all the legacy data in question is in UTC, so I'm prepared to accept the risk of defaulting to that in this case.\n"}

{"question_id":767657,"answer":"In my experience - if you're thinking a column needs to allow NULLs but also needs to be UNIQUE for values where they exist, you may be modelling the data incorrectly. This often suggests you're creating a separate sub-entity within the same table as a different entity. It probably makes more sense to have this entity in a second table.\nIn the provided example, I would put LibraryCardId in a separate LibraryCards table with a unique not-null foreign key to the People table:\nCREATE TABLE People (\n  Id INT CONSTRAINT PK_MyTable PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY,\n  Name NVARCHAR(250) NOT NULL,\n)\nCREATE TABLE LibraryCards (    \n  LibraryCardId UNIQUEIDENTIFIER CONSTRAINT PK_LibraryCards PRIMARY KEY,\n  PersonId INT NOT NULL\n  CONSTRAINT UQ_LibraryCardId_PersonId UNIQUE (PersonId),\n  FOREIGN KEY (PersonId) REFERENCES People(id)\n)\n\nThis way you don't need to bother with a column being both unique and nullable.

{"question_id":2171177,"answer":"A. Plainly speaking, one common thing an ABI has with an API is that it is an interface. A reusable program exposes a stable interface (API) that can be used to reuse the program in another program.\nB. However, an ABI is an interface issued for some specific processor-platform for some specific language. All compiler-vendors desiring to  target that platform for that same language will have to ensure that not only compiled code in form of relocatable object codes comply with the interface to be able to link and cross-link with each other but also executables comply with it to be able to run on the platform at all. So, ABI is much broader set of specifications\/standard than a typical function API. It may include some API objects to be enforced upon the language-users by the compiler. The compiler-vendor will have to include support for the same in their distributions. Needless to say, the platform vendor is the rightful authority to issue ABIs for its platform. Both compiler vendors and ABIs need to comply with the corresponding language-standard (e.g. ISO standard  for C++).\nC. A definition of an ABI by a platform vendor is:\n\"1. The specifications to which an executable must conform in order to execute in a specific execution environment. For example, the Linux ABI for the Arm Architecture.\n\nA particular aspect of the specifications to which independently produced relocatable files must conform in order to be statically linkable and executable. For example, the C++ ABI for the Arm Architecture, the Run-time ABI for the Arm Architecture, the C Library ABI for the Arm Architecture.\"\n\nD. For example. A generic ABI for C++ based on Itanium architecture has also been issued by a consortium. The extent to which platform-vendors's own ABIs for C++ comply with it is entirely up to the platform vendors.\nE. As another example. The C++ ABI for Arm Architecture is here.\nF. Having said that, under the hood, it is the ABI of a processor-architecture that will ensure that the API between one reusable program and another program that reuses it works for that processor-architecture.\nG. That brings us to service-oriented components (e.g. SOAP-based web services). They too require an API to exist between a SOAP-based web service and client program (could be an app, front-end or another web service) for the client program to reuse the web service.The API is described in terms of standardized protocols like WSDL  (interface description) and SOAP(message format) and is language-neutral and platform-neutral. It is not targeted to any specific processor-platform and thus it is not \"binary\" like ABI. A client-program on any one platform type and written in any language can remotely reuse a web service written in any other language and hosted on an entirely different processor-platform. This is made possible by the fact that both WSDL and SOAP are text-based (XML) protocols.

Why do languages come in?\n\n\nAnyway, I've downloaded the [PDF] System V Application Binary Interface Edition 4.1 (1997-03-18) to see what exactly it contains.

{"question_id":589575,"answer":"I notice that all the other answers here have focused almost exclusively on integral types, while the questioner also asked about floating-points.\n\nI don't think the C++ standard requires it, but compilers for the most common platforms these days generally follow the IEEE754 standard for their floating-point numbers. This standard specifies four types of binary floating-point (as well as some BCD formats, which I've never seen support for in C++ compilers):\n\n\nHalf precision (binary16) - 11-bit significand, exponent range -14 to 15\nSingle precision (binary32) - 24-bit significand, exponent range -126 to 127\nDouble precision (binary64) - 53-bit significand, exponent range -1022 to 1023\nQuadruple precision (binary128) - 113-bit significand, exponent range -16382 to 16383\n\n\nHow does this map onto C++ types, then? Generally the float uses single precision; thus, sizeof(float) = 4. Then double uses double precision (I believe that's the source of the name double), and long double may be either double or quadruple precision (it's quadruple on my system, but on 32-bit systems it may be double). I don't know of any compilers that offer half precision floating-points.\n\nIn summary, this is the usual:\n\n\nsizeof(float) = 4\nsizeof(double) = 8\nsizeof(long double) = 8 or 16\n\n","target":0,"question":"How to initialize all members of an array to the same value?\n\nI'm looking for detailed information regarding the size of basic C++ types.\nI know that it depends on the architecture (16 bits, 32 bits, 64 bits) and the compiler.\n\nBut are there any standards for C++?\n\nI'm using Visual Studio 2008 on a 32-bit architecture.

I setup a Maven project and add log4j as a dependency in the pom.xml file.  The IDEA inspections run fine and my unit tests all compile and run.\n\nI then added hunnysoft's jmime library to my local maven repository using the mvn install:install-file as follows.\n\nmvn install:install-file -Dfile=jmime.jar -DgroupId=jmime \\\n-DartifactId=jmime -Dversion=3.1.1e -Dpackaging=jar\n\n\nMaven installed the jar file just fine into my local repository.\n\nI then went into IntelliJ's Settings => Maven => Repository Services and Updated my local repository (so that IntelliJ would reindex the repository contents).\n\nFinally, I added the following dependency to my pom.xml file (just above the log4j dependency).\n\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>jmime<\/groupId>\n    <artifactId>jmime<\/artifactId>\n    <version>3.1.1e<\/version>\n<\/dependency>\n\n\nI now create a new class as follows:\n\npackage com.stackoverflow.question;\n\nimport org.apache.log4j.Logger;\nimport com.hunnysoft.jmime.ByteString;\nimport com.hunnysoft.jmime.Field;\nimport com.hunnysoft.jmime.FieldBody;\n\npublic class StackOverflowQuestion {\n    public Field create(String name, String text) {\n        Logger.getLogger(getClass()).debug(\"create entered\");\n        FieldBody body = new FieldBody();\n        body.setText(new ByteString(text));\n        Field field = new Field();\n        field.setFieldName(name);\n        field.setFieldBody(body);\n        return field;\n    }\n}\n\n\nNow for the weirdness.  IntelliJ's intention mechanism picks up and recognizes the Logger import in the maven pom file just fine.  However, for all of the hunnysoft imports it reports: \"Cannot resolve symbol 'ByteString\/Field\/FieldBody'\", BUT Build => Compile 'StackOverflowQuestion.java' compiles everything correctly and the unit test I created for this class runs fine (though the intentions mark the call to create() as a problem area too).\n\nSo somewhere, somehow IntelliJ is ignoring the jmime.jar file for the intention subsystem.  I'm confused because the log4j dependency works fine and everything compiles and runs fine.  F12 (\"Go To Declaration\") works on the Logger import, but breaks on all the jmime imports.\n\nOh, one other thing, if I go to the 'Packages' view in the \"Projects\" window the \"com.hunnysoft.jmime\" package appears and I can see ALL of the classes I imported in the code snippet above under \"Libraries\".  Removing the above dependency from the pom.xml file causes this package to disappear and the compilation breaks.\n\nIt appears that the inspection's classpath is broken, but there does not seem to be a setting for this anywhere in the Settings => Intentions | Compiler areas (not that I expected any such settings, I believe the IDEA should already know the correct classpath based on the pom file and JDK).\n\nAs a final experiment I created a brand new standard J2SE application project (without using maven) and added the jmime.jar file directly to the project as one of its libraries.  I run into exactly the same problems as described above in this new project.\n\nHere is the MANIFEST.MF from the jmime jar file.\n\nManifest-Version: 1.0\nAnt-Version: Apache Ant 1.5.4\nCreated-By: 10.0-b23 (Sun Microsystems Inc.)\n\nName: com\/hunnysoft\/jmime\/\nSealed: true\nSpecification-Title: Hunny JMIME\nSpecification-Version: 3.1.1\nSpecification-Vendor: Hunny Software, Inc.\nImplementation-Title: com.hunnysoft.jmime\nImplementation-Version: 3.1.1E\nImplementation-Vendor: Hunny Software, Inc.\n\n\nI don't see anything unusual in this jar file.\n\nMy best guess is that perhaps the problem might be a missing dependency issue.  But AFAIK jmime is supposed to be self contained (JarAnalyzer doesn't come up with anything, but I'm not sure it would if a dependency jar is missing).\n\nSo, anyone have any IDEAs?\n"}

A very common pattern is to use GitHub to store your code, and a server to host your application (if it's a web application). Then you would have 2 remotes (possibly more if you have other environments).\nTry opening your git config by typing git config -e\nNote: press escape, then :, then q then enter to quit out\nExample\nHere's what you might see in your git configs if you had 3 remotes.

GitHub is an obvious place, as are servers that host your app, and you may have other locations too. git push origin simply means it will push to 'origin', which is the name GitHub chooses to default to.\nAs for branchname\nbranchname is simply what you're pushing to the remote.

{"question_id":4476526,"answer":"Here's a summary of all the ways I could find for inserting SVGs into HTML templates together with their differences and their main pros and cons:\n((( 1 )))\n\/* in CSS *\/\nbackground-image: url(happy.svg);\n\nThis way neither allows JS interaction,  nor the CSS itself\ncould have more fine-grained control on the svg parts.\n((( 2 )))\n<img src=\"happy.svg\" \/>\n\nJust like ((( 1 ))), neither allows JS interaction,  nor the CSS itself could have more fine-grained control on the svg parts.\nMethods ((( 1 ))) and ((( 2 ))) are only fine if you want a static svg.\nNote: When using the <img> tag, if you specify a SVG in the srcset attribute and the browser doesn't support it, it'll fallback to the src attribute automatically.\n<img src=\"logo.png\" srcset=\"logo.svg\" alt=\"my logo\">\n\n((( 3 )))\n<div>\n <!-- Paste the SVG code directly here. -->\n <svg>...<\/svg>\n <!-- AKA an inline svg -->\n <!-- would be the same if is created and appended using JavaScript. -->\n<\/div>\n\nThis method does not have any of the caveats mentioned in ((( 1 ))) and ((( 2 ))), however, this method makes template code messy, and also SVGs are copy pasted, so they will not be in their own individual files.\n((( 4 )))\n<object data=\"happy.svg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\"><\/object>\n\nOR:\n<object data=\"your.svg\" type=\"image\/svg+xml\">\n  <img src=\"yourfallback.jpg\" \/>\n<\/object>\n\nUsing this method the SVG will not be accessible using external CSS, but will be accessible using JavaScript.\n((( 5 )))\nUse iconfu\/svg-inject to keep the SVGs in their own individual files (to keep the template code much cleaner), now add the SVGs using <img> tags, and svg-inject will automatically turn them into inline SVGs, so they will be accessible to both CSS and JavaScript.\nNote1: This method works also if imgs are added dynamically (using javascript).\nNote2: SVGs added using this method are also cached by browsers just like images.\n((( 6 )))\nUsing a single SVG sprite file, then use <use> tags to insert them. This way is quite flexible too, having the same effect as ((( 5 ))). This method (and a few more) are shown in action in this video.\n((( 7 )))\n(React-specific way) Turn them into React components (or write a component that loads them).\n((( 8 )))\n<embed src=\"happy.svg\" \/>\n\nAccording to MDN, most modern browsers have deprecated and removed support for browser plug-ins.

{"question_id":134099,"answer":"Eaven if you are going to prevent sql injection front-end, using html or js checks, you'd have to consider that front-end checks are \"bypassable\".\n\nYou can disable js or edit a pattern with a front-end development tool (built in with firefox or chrome nowadays).\n\nSo, in order to prevent SQL injection, would be right to sanitize input date backend inside your controller.\n\nI would like to suggest to you to use filter_input() native PHP function in order to sanitize GET and INPUT values.\n\nIf you want to go ahead with security, for sensible database queries, I'd like to suggest to you to use regular expression to validate data format.\npreg_match() will help you in this case!\nBut take care!

{"question_id":35837,"answer":"Some people think that VCS systems have to be complicated. They encourage inventing terms and concepts on the field. They would probably think that numerous PhDs on the subject would be interesting. Among those are probably the ones that designed Git.\n\nMercurial is designed with a different mentality. Developers should not care much about VCS, and they should instead spend their time on their main function: software engineering. Mercurial allows users to use and happily abuse the system without letting them make any non-recoverable mistakes. \n\nAny professional tool must come with a clearly designed and intuitive CLI. Mercurial users can do most of the work by issuing simple commands without any strange options. In Git double dash, crazy options are the norm. Mercurial has a substantial advantage if you are a CLI person (and to be honest, any self-respecting Software Engineer should be).\n\nTo give an example, suppose you do a commit by mistake. You forgot to edit some files. To undo you action in Mercurial you simply type:\n\n $ hg rollback \n\nYou then get a message that the system undos your last transaction. \n\nIn Git you have to type:\n\n $ git reset --soft HEAD^ \n\nSo ok suppose you have an idea what reset is about. But in addition you have to know what \"--soft\" and \"--hard\" resets are (any intuitive guesses?). Oh and of course don't forget the '^' character in the end! (now what in Ritchie's name is that...)\n\nMercurial's integration with 3rd party tools like kdiff3 and meld is much better as well. Generate your patches merge your branches without much fuss. Mercurial also includes a simple http server that you activate by typing \n\n hg serve \n\nAnd let others browse your repository.\n\nThe bottom line is, Git does what Mercurial does, in a much more complicated way and with a far inferior CLI.

{"question_id":151199,"answer":"If you don't have a date handling library (or you suspect it has bugs in it), here's an abstract algorithm that should be easily translatable into most languages.\nPerform the following calculation on each date, and then simply subtract the two results. All quotients and remainders are positive integers.\nStep A. Start by identifying the parts of the date as Y (year), M (month) and D (day). These are variables that will change as we go along.\nStep B. Subtract 3 from M\n\n(so that January is -2 and December is 9).\n\nStep C. If M is negative, add 12 to M and subtract 1 from the year Y.\n\n(This changes the \"start of the year\" to 1 March, with months numbered 0 (March) through 11 (February). The reason to do this is so that the \"day number within a year\" doesn't change between leap years and ordinary years, and so that the \"short\" month is at the end of the year, so there's no following month needing special treatment.)\n\nStep D.\nDivide M by 5 to get a quotient Q\u2081 and remainder R\u2081. Add Q\u2081 \u00d7 153 to D. Use R\u2081 in the next step.\n\n(There are 153 days in every 5 months starting from 1 March.)\n\nStep E. Divide R\u2081 by 2 to get a quotient Q\u2082 and ignore the remainder. Add R\u2081 \u00d7 31 - Q\u2082 to D.\n\n(Within each group of 5 months, there are 61 days in every 2 months, and within that the first of each pair of months is 31 days. It's safe to ignore the fact that Feb is shorter than 30 days because at this point you only care about the day number of 1-Feb, not of 1-Mar the following year.)\n\nSteps D & E combined - alternative method\nBefore the first use, set L=[0,31,61,92,122,153,184,214,245,275,306,337]\n\n(This is a tabulation of the cumulative number of days in the (adjusted) year before the first day of each month.)\n\nAdd L[M] to D.\nStep F\nSkip this step if you use Julian calendar dates rather than Gregorian calendar dates; the change-over varies between countries, but is taken as 3 Sep 1752 in most English-speaking countries, and 4 Oct 1582 in most of Europe.\n\nYou can also skip this step if you're certain that you'll never have to deal with dates outside the range 1-Mar-1900 to 28-Feb-2100, but then you must make the same choice for all dates that you process.\n\nDivide Y by 100 to get a quotient Q\u2083 and remainder R\u2083. Divide Q\u2083 by 4 to get another quotient Q\u2084 and ignore the remainder. Add Q\u2084 + 36524 \u00d7 Q\u2083 to D.\nAssign R\u2083 to Y.\nStep G.\nDivide the Y by 4 to get a quotient Q\u2085 and ignore the remainder. Add Q\u2085 + 365 \u00d7 Y to D.\nStep H.

{"question_id":1759300,"answer":"One use case might occur on inheritance. For example, if all below cases are true:\n\nyou have a base class of some class\nthe base class needs to be abstract\nthe base class has no pure virtual method other than destructor\nyou don't want to create cpp file for the base class because in vain\n\nthen you have to define the destructor; otherwise, you will have some undefined referance linker errors. Moreover, you have to do not only define but also to define the destructor with inline keyword; otherwise, you will have multiple definition linker errors.\nThis may happen for some helper classes that contains only static methods or writing base exception classes etc.\nLet's give an example:\nBase.h:\nclass Base {\npublic:\n    Base(SomeElementType someElement) noexcept : _someElement(std::move(someElement)) {}\n\n    virtual ~Base() = 0;\n\nprotected:\n    SomeElementType _someElement;\n}\n\ninline Base::~Base() = default;\n\nDerived1.h:\n#include \"Base.h\"\n\nclass Derived1 : public Base {\npublic:\n    Derived1(SomeElementType someElement) noexcept : Base(std::move(someElement)) {}\n\n    void DoSomething1() const;\n}\n\nDerived1.cpp:\n#include \"Derived1.h\"\n\nvoid Derived1::DoSomething1() const {\n    \/\/ use _someElement \n}\n\nDerived2.h:\n#include \"Base.h\"\n\nclass Derived2 : public Base {\npublic:\n    Derived2(SomeElementType someElement) noexcept : Base(std::move(someElement)) {}\n\n    void DoSomething2() const;\n}\n\nDerived2.cpp:\n#include \"Derived2.h\"\n\nvoid Derived2::DoSomething2() const {\n    \/\/ use _someElement \n}\n\nGenerally, abstract classes have some pure virtual methods other than constructor or destructor. So, you didn't have to seperate decleration and definition of virtual destructor of the base class, you could just write virtual ~Base() = default; on class decleration. However, in our case it's not like that.\nAs far as I know, MSVC allow you to write something like that on class decleration: virtual ~Base() = 0 {}. So you don't need to seperate decleration and definition with inline keyword. But it will only work with MSVC compiler.\nReal world example:\nBaseException.h:\n#pragma once\n\n#include <string>\n\nclass BaseException : public std::exception {\npublic:\n    BaseException(std::string message) noexcept : message(std::move(message)) {}\n    virtual char const* what() const noexcept { return message.c_str(); }\n\n    virtual ~BaseException() = 0;\n\nprivate:\n    std::string message;\n};\n\ninline BaseException::~BaseException() = default;\n\nSomeException.h:\n#pragma once\n\n#include \"BaseException.h\"\n\nclass SomeException : public BaseException {\npublic:\n    SomeException(std::string message) noexcept : BaseException(std::move(message)) {}\n};\n\nSomeOtherException.h:\n#pragma once\n\n#include \"BaseException.h\"\n\nclass SomeOtherException : public BaseException {\npublic:\n    SomeOtherException(std::string message) noexcept : BaseException(std::move(message)) {}\n};\n\nmain.cpp:\n#include <SomeException.h>\n#include <SomeOtherException.h>\n\n#include <iostream>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nstatic int DoSomething(int argc) {\n    try {\n        switch (argc) {\n        case 0:\n            throw SomeException(\"some\");\n        case 1:\n            throw SomeOtherException(\"some other\");\n        default:\n            return 0;\n        }\n    }\n    catch (const exception& ex) {\n        cout << ex.what() << endl;\n        return 1;\n    }\n}\n\nint main(int argc, char**) {\n    return DoSomething(argc);\n}\n\n","target":0,"question":"INNER JOIN ON vs WHERE clause\n\nWhen should I write the keyword inline for a function\/method in C++?\n\nAfter seeing some answers, some related questions:\n\n\nWhen should I not write the keyword 'inline' for a function\/method in C++?\nWhen will the compiler not know when to make a function\/method 'inline'?\nDoes it matter if an application is multithreaded when one writes 'inline' for a function\/method?\n\n"}

{"question_id":30668326,"answer":"If someone is still looking for answer then this link will be helpful\nLink\n\nThe constructor and getInitialState both in React are used to\ninitialise state, but they can't be used interchangeably.\nWe use getInitialState with React.createClass and constructor is used\nwith React.Component.\n\nThe constructor is the ideal place to set up your component's initial state. Instead of using setState() in other methods, you will need to assign the initial state directly.\nclass Hello extends React.Component { \n   constructor(props) { \n   super(props); \n   this.setState({ \n  title: 'This is the first test' \n   }); \n}   \n  render() { \n    return <div>{this.state.title} <\/div> \n  } \n}   \nReactDOM.render(<Hello \/>, document.getElementById('container'));\n\n\nThe main fundamental difference between ES5 and ES6 is in the new\nclass keyword. ES5 didn't provide the convenience of defining the\nReact component as classes however ES did provide the convenience to\ndefine react component as class.\nand more simple is that getInitialState is the ES5 friendly method to\ndefine the initial state of a React component. We use getInitialState\nwith React.createClass and constructor is used with React.Component\n\nExample:\nclass Goodmorning extends React.Component { \n  render() { \n    return <span>Good Morning<\/span>; \n  } \n}\nIt would rely on helper module called create-react-class: \nvar createGoodmorningReactClass = require('create-react-class'); \nvar Goodmorning = createReactClass({ \n  render: function() { \n    return <span>Good Morning<\/span>; \n  } \n}); \nThe object passed into create-react-class that is defined in initial stage by calling the getInitialState attribute: \n var Goodmorning = createReactClass({ \n  getInitialState: function() { \n    return {name: this.props.name}; \n  }, \n  render: function() { \n    return <span>Good {this.state.name}<\/span>; \n  } \n}); \nIn ES6 implementation: \nclass Goodmorning extends React.Component { \n  constructor(props) { \n    super(props); \n    this.state = { \n      name: props.name \n    } \n  } \n  render() { \n    return <span>Good {this.state.name}<\/span>; \n  } \n} \n\nand also read this article if someone is still looking for an answer.\nLink\n","target":0,"question":"How do I use sudo to redirect output to a location I don't have permission to write to?\n\nI've seen both used interchangeably.    \n\nWhat are the main use cases for both?

And the view can persist in spite of this error: it would be a bug but it\u2019s not worth interfering with the loading of the view (let\u2019s say that the user is just presented with a few wrong numbers).

{"question_id":9901082,"answer":"Necromancing.\nIMHO, the existing answers leave much to be desired.\nAt first, it's very confusing. \nYou have a (nowhere defined) function \"require\", which is used to get modules. \nAnd in said (CommonJS) modules, you can use require, exports and module, WITHOUT THEM EVER BEING DEFINED. \nNot that it would be new that you could use undefined variables in JS, but you couldn't use an undefined function.\nSo it looks a little like magic at first.\nBut all magic is based on deception. \nWhen you dig a little deeper, it turns out it is really quite simple: \nRequire is simply a (non-standard) function defined at global scope. \n(global scope = window-object in browser, global-object in NodeJS). \nNote that by default, the \"require function\" is only implemented in NodeJS, not in the browser. \nAlso, note that to add to the confusion, for the browser, there is RequireJS, which, despite the name containing the characters \"require\", RequireJS absolutely does NOT implement require\/CommonJS - instead RequireJS implements AMD, which is something similar, but not the same (aka incompatible).\nThat last one is just one important thing you have to realize on your way to understanding require.\nNow, as such, to answer the question \"what is require\", we \"simply\" need to know what this function does.\nThis is perhaps best explained with code. \nHere's a simple implementation by Michele Nasti, the code you can find on his github page.\nLet's call our minimalisc implementation of the require function \"myRequire\":\nfunction myRequire(name) \n{\n    console.log(`Evaluating file ${name}`);\n    if (!(name in myRequire.cache)) {\n        console.log(`${name} is not in cache; reading from disk`);\n        let code = fs.readFileSync(name, 'utf8');\n        let module = { exports: {} };\n        myRequire.cache[name] = module;\n        let wrapper = Function(\"require, exports, module\", code);\n        wrapper(myRequire, module.exports, module);\n    }\n    console.log(`${name} is in cache. Returning it...`);\n    return myRequire.cache[name].exports;\n}\nmyRequire.cache = Object.create(null);\nwindow.require = myRequire;\nconst stuff = window.require('.\/main.js');\nconsole.log(stuff);\n\nNow you notice, the object \"fs\" is used here. \nFor simplicity's sake, Michele just imported the NodeJS fs module:\nconst fs = require('fs');\n\nWhich wouldn't be necessary.\nSo in the browser, you could make a simple implementation of require with a SYNCHRONOUS XmlHttpRequest:\nconst fs = {\n    file: `\n    \/\/ module.exports = \\\"Hello World\\\";\n        \n    module.exports = function(){ return 5*3;};\n    \n    `\n    , getFile(fileName: string, encoding: string): string\n    {\n        \/\/ https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/API\/XMLHttpRequest\/Synchronous_and_Asynchronous_Requests\n        let client = new XMLHttpRequest();\n        \/\/ client.setRequestHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"text\/plain;charset=UTF-8\");\n\n        \/\/ open(method, url, async)\n        client.open(\"GET\", fileName, false);\n        client.send();\n        if (client.status === 200)\n            return client.responseText;\n\n        return null;\n    }\n\n\n    , readFileSync: function (fileName: string, encoding: string): string\n    {\n        \/\/ this.getFile(fileName, encoding);\n        return this.file; \/\/ Example, getFile would fetch this file \n    }\n};\n\nBasically, what require thus does, is it downloads a JavaScript-file, evals it in an anonymous namespace (aka Function), with the parameters \"require\", \"exports\" and \"module\", and returns the exports, meaning an object's public functions and properties.\nNote that this evaluation is recursive: you require files, which themselfs can require files.\nThis way, all \"global\" variables used in your module are variables in the require-wrapper-function namespace, and don't pollute the global scope with unwanted variables.\nAlso, this way, you can reuse code without depending on namespaces, so you get \"modularity\" in JavaScript. \"modularity\" in quotes, because this is not exactly true, though, because you can still write window.bla\/global.bla, and hence still pollute the global scope... Also, this establishes a separation between private and public functions, the public functions being the exports.\nNow instead of saying\nmodule.exports = function(){ return 5*3;};\n\nYou can also say:\nfunction privateSomething()\n{\n    return 42:\n}\n\n\nfunction privateSomething2()\n{\n    return 21:\n}\n\n\nmodule.exports = {\n      getRandomNumber: privateSomething\n     ,getHalfRandomNumber: privateSomething2\n};\n\nand return an object.\nAlso, because your modules get evaluated in a function with parameters\n\"require\", \"exports\" and \"module\", your modules can use the undeclared variables \"require\", \"exports\" and \"module\", which might be startling at first. The require parameter there is of course a pointer to the require function saved into a variable. \nCool, right ? \nSeen this way, require looses its magic, and becomes simple. \nNow, the real require-function will do a few more checks and quirks, of course, but this is the essence of what that boils down to.\nAlso, in 2020, you should use the ECMA implementations instead of require:\nimport defaultExport from \"module-name\";\nimport * as name from \"module-name\";\nimport { export1 } from \"module-name\";\nimport { export1 as alias1 } from \"module-name\";\nimport { export1 , export2 } from \"module-name\";\nimport { foo , bar } from \"module-name\/path\/to\/specific\/un-exported\/file\";\nimport { export1 , export2 as alias2 , [...] } from \"module-name\";\nimport defaultExport, { export1 [ , [...] ] } from \"module-name\";\nimport defaultExport, * as name from \"module-name\";\nimport \"module-name\";\n\nAnd if you need a dynamic non-static import (e.g. load a polyfill based on browser-type),  there is the ECMA-import function\/keyword:\nvar promise = import(\"module-name\");\n\nnote that import is not synchronous like require. \nInstead, import is a promise, so\nvar something = require(\"something\");\n\nbecomes\nvar something = await import(\"something\");\n\nbecause import returns a promise (asynchronous).\nSo basically, unlike require, import replaces fs.readFileSync with fs.readFileAsync.\nasync readFileAsync(fileName, encoding) \n{\n    const textDecoder = new TextDecoder(encoding);\n    \/\/ textDecoder.ignoreBOM = true;\n    const response = await fetch(fileName);\n    console.log(response.ok);\n    console.log(response.status);\n    console.log(response.statusText);\n    \/\/ let json = await response.json();\n    \/\/ let txt = await response.text();\n    \/\/ let blo:Blob = response.blob();\n    \/\/ let ab:ArrayBuffer = await response.arrayBuffer();\n    \/\/ let fd = await response.formData()\n    \/\/ Read file almost by line\n    \/\/ https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/API\/ReadableStreamDefaultReader\/read#Example_2_-_handling_text_line_by_line\n    let buffer = await response.arrayBuffer();\n    let file = textDecoder.decode(buffer);\n    return file;\n} \/\/ End Function readFileAsync\n\nThis of course requires the import-function to be async as well.\n\"use strict\";\nasync function myRequireAsync(name) {\n    console.log(`Evaluating file ${name}`);\n    if (!(name in myRequireAsync.cache)) {\n        console.log(`${name} is not in cache; reading from disk`);\n        let code = await fs.readFileAsync(name, 'utf8');\n        let module = { exports: {} };\n        myRequireAsync.cache[name] = module;\n        let wrapper = Function(\"asyncRequire, exports, module\", code);\n        await wrapper(myRequireAsync, module.exports, module);\n    }\n    console.log(`${name} is in cache. Returning it...`);\n    return myRequireAsync.cache[name].exports;\n}\nmyRequireAsync.cache = Object.create(null);\nwindow.asyncRequire = myRequireAsync;\nasync () => {\n    const asyncStuff = await window.asyncRequire('.\/main.js');\n    console.log(asyncStuff);\n};\n\nEven better, right ?\nWell yea, except that there is no ECMA-way to dynamically import synchronously (without promise).\nNow, to understand the repercussions, you absolutely might want to read up on promises\/async-await here, if you don't know what that is.\nBut very simply put, if a function returns a promise, it can be \"awaited\":\n\"use strict\";\nfunction sleep(interval) \n{\n    return new Promise(\n        function (resolve, reject) \n        {\n            let wait = setTimeout(function () {\n            clearTimeout(wait);\n            \/\/reject(new Error(`Promise timed out ! (timeout = ${timeout})`));\n            resolve();\n        }, interval);\n    });\n}\n\nThe promise would then normally be used like this:\nfunction testSleep() \n{\n    sleep(3000).then(function () \n    {\n        console.log(\"Waited for 3 seconds\");\n    });\n}\n\nBut when you return a promise, you can also use await, which means we get rid of the callback (sort of - actually, it is being replaced with a state-machine in the compiler\/interpreter). \nThis way, we make asynchronous code feel like synchronous, so we now can use try-catch for error-handling. \nNote that if you want to use await in a function, that function must be declared async (hence async-await).\nasync function testSleep() \n{\n    await sleep(5000);\n    console.log(\"i waited 5 seconds\");\n}\n\nAnd also please note that in JavaScript, there is no way to call an async function (blockingly) from a synchronous one (the ones you know). So if you want to use await (aka ECMA-import), all your code needs to be async, which most likely is a problem, if everything isn't already async...\nAn example of where this simplified implementation of require fails, is when you require a file that is not valid JavaScript, e.g. when you require css, html, txt, svg and images or other binary files. \nAnd it's easy to see why: \nIf you e.g. put HTML into a JavaScript function body, you of course rightfully get\nSyntaxError: Unexpected token '<'\n\nbecause of Function(\"bla\", \"<doctype...\")\nNow, if you wanted to extend this to for example include non-modules, you could just check the downloaded file-contents for code.indexOf(\"module.exports\") == -1, and then e.g. eval(\"jquery content\") instead of Func (which works fine as long as you're in the browser). Since downloads with Fetch\/XmlHttpRequests are subject to the same-origin-policy, and integrity is ensured by SSL\/TLS, the use of eval here is rather harmless, provided you checked the JS files before you added them to your site, but that much should be standard-operating-procedure.\nNote that there are several implementations of require-like functionality:\n\nthe CommonJS (CJS) format, used in Node.js, uses a require function and module.exports to define dependencies and modules. The npm ecosystem is built upon this format. (this is what is implemented above)\n\nthe Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD) format, used in browsers, uses a define function to define modules. (basically, this is overcomplicated archaic crap that you wouldn't ever want to use). Also, AMD is the format that is implemented by RequireJS (note that despite the name containing the characters \"require\", AMD absolutely is NOT CommonJS).\n\nthe ES Module (ESM) format. As of ES6 (ES2015), JavaScript supports a native module format. It uses an export keyword to export a module\u2019s public API and an import keyword to import it. This is the one you should use if you don't give a flying f*ck about archaic browsers, such as Safari and IE\/EdgeHTML.\n\nthe System.register format, designed to support ES6 modules within ES5. (the one you should use, if you need support for older browsers (Safari & IE & old versions of Chrome on mobile phones\/tablets), because it can load all formats [for some, plugins are required], can handle cyclic-dependencies, and CSS and HTML - don't define your modules as system.register, though - the format is rather complicated, and remember, it can read the other easier formats)\n\nthe Universal Module Definition (UMD) format, compatible to all the above mentioned formats (except ECMA), used both in the browser and in Node.js. It\u2019s especially useful if you write modules that can be used in both NodeJS and the browser. It's somewhat flawed, as it doesn't support the latest ECMA modules, though (maybe this will get fixed) - use System.register instead.\n\n\nImportant sidenote on the function argument \"exports\": \nJavaScript uses call-by-value-sharing - meaning objects are passed as a pointer, but the pointer-value itselfs is passed BY VALUE, not by reference.   So you can't override exports by assigning it a new object. Instead, if you want to override exports, you need to assign the new object to module.exports - because hey, module is the pointer passed by value, but exports in module.exports is the reference to the original exports pointer.\nImportant sidenote on module-Scope: \nModules are evaluated ONCE, and then cached by require. \nThat means all your modules have a Singleton scope. \nIf you want a non-singleton scope, you have to do something like:\nvar x = require(\"foo.js\").createInstance();\n\nor simply\nvar x = require(\"foo.js\")();\n\nwith appropriate code returned by your module.\n","target":0,"question":"How to deal with persistent storage (e.g. databases) in Docker\n\nI'm trying to get JavaScript to read\/write to a PostgreSQL database.

{"question_id":2253110,"answer":"I have been working with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for over 20 years. So below is my solution to help you:\n\nALWAYS use External CSS via a <link> tag. External CSS is far superior to \"embedded\" <style> and \"inline\" element styles <span style=\"color:blue;\">my text<\/span> simply because external styles downloaded to the browser are cached for every page in your website and affect all web pages, not just one. Consider moving all those styles sprinkled throughout your website to CSS classes in your sheets. Make sure you add selectors to increase their weight in cases where they might have cascaded over earlier inherited styles. Note: Many JavaScript API's like Angular and others use embedded CSS which means they are slower and have to reload CSS every refresh or revisit to the site. Bad design!\nALWAYS use a \"Reset\" Style Sheet for all your basic HTML Elements. Most CSS packages like Bootstrap and others come with a reset or reboot sheet. These restyle all your HTML element selectors so they look decent across all browsers and user agents. This saves you the nightmare of having to restyle and customize design across basic elements like form controls, layouts, text, etc. I wrote my own \"reset\" sheet years ago. I am going to post it on GitHub under \"Universal CSS Framework\" soon if you would like mine. Works in all the old and new browsers.\nRemember, all text-based styles cascade and inherit naturally down through the sites elements! So, you should rarely need to repeat font styles, line-heights, etc. Most young developers forget this. Text-based styles are inherited down the HTML tree so only have to be written one time in a parent. Often the <body> element is the best placed to set basic font styles, etc.\nBecause of #3 you do NOT need CSS precrocessors like SASS to reorganize or manage your style sheets. Stay away from these third-party dependencies. CSS can be written to inherit or cascade styles through the site so you do not have to repeat the same font styling or properties across CSS classes, etc.\nGroup your Block Level\/Layout styles that control design. Use ID selectors (#myid) on top level HTML blocks to separate sections and use those in CSS selectors to manage items specific to that page or website section (#main .someclass {...}). These have the advantage that they are easy to track and easy to segregate, but ID selectors have very high selectivity or weight. ID selectors have a 1-0-0 or 100 weight over class which has 0-1-0 or 10 weight. This prevents any later style shifts from damaging your previous custom styles in specific protected sections.\nDesign all CSS around a Single CSS Class that can be Reused. Avoid attaching more element and chains of classes in CSS selectors until you absolutely need to override a common shared class with a custom one. Example: .articlelink{...} would be the shared universal style everyone can access. .block1 .area2 .articlelink{...} would allow you to create a custom version throughout a section without creating a new class or changing the HTML.\nUse CSS Comments! \/* My New Styles *\/ ...followed by blocks of related CSS or just use comments to explain what is not intuitive in your code.\nIf you have big projects, have each developer write their own custom CSS sheets for their sections, but inherit the main site style sheets. First, make sure all sections of the website link to your basic reset and base site sheets first. This allows basic element styles, font settings, layout, page design, forms, and colors to be enforced by the base sheets first so developers only add new styles needed rather than reinventing the same wheel. As you update the base sheets all developers inherit, those appear naturally across all sections of the project with no effort, and the teams can see those instantly.\n\nRemember, you are working with cascading style sheets, not style sheets! That means most text-based styles are designed to inherit from all the parent elements, then cascade those same styles down into your trees of HTML across thousands of pages with no extra code. Most new web developers fail to grasp the simplicity of CSS, so struggle with SASS and other tools to fix it. It just is not needed. CSS was designed this way over 20 years ago by very smart people that solved all these issues for you.\nIf you really start to use CSS the right way, you find you can erase most of the styles, SASS, minimization, and other external routines and extra code your website once used, while enjoying the cascading effects of CSS that were designed to make minimal coding possible long ago.\n<html>\n  <body style=\"color:blue;\">\n    <main>\n      <section>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <p>hello blue world<\/p>\n            <\/div>\n          <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n      <\/section>\n    <\/main>\n  <\/body>\n<\/html>\n\nPeace\n","target":0,"question":"Where can I find php.ini?\n\nI have been heavily relying on CSS for a website that I am working on. Right now, all the CSS styles are being applied on a per tag basis, and so now I am trying to move it to more of an external styling to help with any future changes.\n\nBut now the problem is that I have noticed I am getting a \"CSS Explosion\".  It is becoming difficult for me to decide how to best organize and abstract data within the CSS file.\n\nI am using a large number of div tags within the website, moving from a heavily table-based website.  So I'm getting a lot of CSS selectors that look like this:\n\ndiv.title {\n  background-color: blue;\n  color: white;\n  text-align: center;\n}\n\ndiv.footer {\n  \/* Styles Here *\/\n}\n\ndiv.body {\n  \/* Styles Here *\/\n}\n\n\/* And many more *\/\n\n\nIt's not too bad yet, but as I am a beginner, I was wondering if recommendations could be made on how best to organize the various parts of a CSS file.  I don't want to have a separate CSS attribute for every element on my website, and I always want the CSS file to be fairly intuitive and easy to read.\n\nMy ultimate goal is to make it easy to use the CSS files and demonstrate their power to increase the speed of web development. This way, other individuals that may work on this site in the future will also get into the practice of using good coding practices, rather than having to pick it up the way I did.\n"}

From a related post on the Android developer's blog: \n\n\n  There are two easy ways to avoid context-related memory leaks. The most obvious one is to avoid escaping the context outside of its own scope. The example above showed the case of a static reference but inner classes and their implicit reference to the outer class can be equally dangerous. The second solution is to use the Application context. This context will live as long as your application is alive and does not depend on the activities life cycle. If you plan on keeping long-lived objects that need a context, remember the application object. You can obtain it easily by calling Context.getApplicationContext() or Activity.getApplication().\n\n\nBut for the AlertDialog() neither getApplicationContext() or getApplication() is acceptable as a Context, as it throws the exception: \n\n\n  \"Unable to add window \u2014 token null is not for an application\u201d\n\n\nper references: 1, 2, 3, etc.\n\nSo, should this really be considered a \"bug\", since we are officially advised to use Activity.getApplication() and yet it doesn't function as advertised?\n\nJim\n"}

{"question_id":8389648,"answer":"There's a point in the Intel architecture that people often forget, the dispatch ports are shared between Int and FP\/SIMD. This means that you will only get a certain amount of bursts of FP\/SIMD before the loop logic will create bubbles in your floating point stream. Mystical got more flops out of his code, because he used longer strides in his unrolled loop.\n\nIf you look at the Nehalem\/Sandy Bridge architecture here \nhttp:\/\/www.realworldtech.com\/page.cfm?ArticleID=RWT091810191937&p=6\nit's quite clear what happens.\n\nIn contrast, it should be easier to reach peak performance on AMD (Bulldozer) as the INT and FP\/SIMD pipes have separate issue ports with their own scheduler.\n\nThis is only theoretical as I have neither of these processors to test.\n","target":0,"question":"How can I disable landscape mode in Android?\n\nHow can the theoretical peak performance of 4 floating point operations (double precision) per cycle be achieved on a modern x86-64 Intel CPU?\nAs far as I understand it takes three cycles for an SSE add and five cycles for a mul to complete on most of the modern Intel CPUs (see for example Agner Fog's 'Instruction Tables' ). Due to pipelining, one can get a throughput of one add per cycle, if the algorithm has at least three independent summations. Since that is true for both packed addpd as well as the scalar addsd versions and SSE registers can contain two double's, the throughput can be as much as two flops per cycle.\nFurthermore, it seems (although I've not seen any proper documentation on this) add's and mul's can be executed in parallel giving a theoretical max throughput of four flops per cycle.\nHowever, I've not been able to replicate that performance with a simple C\/C++ programme. My best attempt resulted in about 2.7 flops\/cycle. If anyone can contribute a simple C\/C++ or assembler programme which demonstrates peak performance, that'd be greatly appreciated.\nMy attempt:\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <math.h>\n#include <sys\/time.h>\n\ndouble stoptime(void) {\n   struct timeval t;\n   gettimeofday(&t,NULL);\n   return (double) t.tv_sec + t.tv_usec\/1000000.0;\n}\n\ndouble addmul(double add, double mul, int ops){\n   \/\/ Need to initialise differently otherwise compiler might optimise away\n   double sum1=0.1, sum2=-0.1, sum3=0.2, sum4=-0.2, sum5=0.0;\n   double mul1=1.0, mul2= 1.1, mul3=1.2, mul4= 1.3, mul5=1.4;\n   int loops=ops\/10;          \/\/ We have 10 floating point operations inside the loop\n   double expected = 5.0*add*loops + (sum1+sum2+sum3+sum4+sum5)\n               + pow(mul,loops)*(mul1+mul2+mul3+mul4+mul5);\n\n   for (int i=0; i<loops; i++) {\n      mul1*=mul; mul2*=mul; mul3*=mul; mul4*=mul; mul5*=mul;\n      sum1+=add; sum2+=add; sum3+=add; sum4+=add; sum5+=add;\n   }\n   return  sum1+sum2+sum3+sum4+sum5+mul1+mul2+mul3+mul4+mul5 - expected;\n}\n\nint main(int argc, char** argv) {\n   if (argc != 2) {\n      printf(\"usage: %s <num>\\n\", argv[0]);\n      printf(\"number of operations: <num> millions\\n\");\n      exit(EXIT_FAILURE);\n   }\n   int n = atoi(argv[1]) * 1000000;\n   if (n<=0)\n       n=1000;\n\n   double x = M_PI;\n   double y = 1.0 + 1e-8;\n   double t = stoptime();\n   x = addmul(x, y, n);\n   t = stoptime() - t;\n   printf(\"addmul:\\t %.3f s, %.3f Gflops, res=%f\\n\", t, (double)n\/t\/1e9, x);\n   return EXIT_SUCCESS;\n}\n\nCompiled with:\ng++ -O2 -march=native addmul.cpp ; .\/a.out 1000\n\nproduces the following output on an Intel Core i5-750, 2.66\u00a0GHz:\naddmul:  0.270 s, 3.707 Gflops, res=1.326463\n\nThat is, just about 1.4 flops per cycle.

Is there a simple example which achieves four flops per cycle?\nNice little programme by Mysticial; here are my results (run just for a few seconds though):\n\ngcc -O2 -march=nocona: 5.6 Gflops out of 10.66 Gflops (2.1 flops\/cycle)\ncl \/O2, openmp removed: 10.1 Gflops out of 10.66 Gflops (3.8 flops\/cycle)\n\nIt all seems a bit complex, but my conclusions so far:\n\ngcc -O2 changes the order of independent floating point operations with\nthe aim of alternating\naddpd and mulpd's if possible. Same applies to gcc-4.6.2 -O2 -march=core2.\n\ngcc -O2 -march=nocona seems to keep the order of floating point operations as defined in\nthe C++ source.\n\ncl \/O2, the 64-bit compiler from the\nSDK for Windows 7\ndoes loop-unrolling automatically and seems to try and arrange operations\nso that groups of three addpd's alternate with three mulpd's (well, at least on my system and for my simple programme).\n\nMy Core i5 750 (Nehalem architecture)\ndoesn't like alternating add's and mul's and seems unable\nto run both operations in parallel. However, if grouped in 3's, it suddenly works like magic.\n\nOther architectures (possibly Sandy Bridge and others) appear to\nbe able to execute add\/mul in parallel without problems\nif they alternate in the assembly code.\n\nAlthough difficult to admit, but on my system cl \/O2 does a much better job at low-level optimising operations for my system and achieves close to peak performance for the little C++ example above. I measured between\n1.85-2.01 flops\/cycle (have used clock() in Windows which is not that precise. I guess, need to use a better timer - thanks Mackie Messer).\n\nThe best I managed  with gcc was to manually loop unroll and arrange\nadditions and multiplications in groups of three. With\ng++ -O2 -march=nocona  addmul_unroll.cpp\nI get at best 0.207s, 4.825 Gflops which corresponds to 1.8 flops\/cycle\nwhich I'm quite happy with now.\n\n\nIn the C++ code I've replaced the for loop with:\n   for (int i=0; i<loops\/3; i++) {\n       mul1*=mul; mul2*=mul; mul3*=mul;\n       sum1+=add; sum2+=add; sum3+=add;\n       mul4*=mul; mul5*=mul; mul1*=mul;\n       sum4+=add; sum5+=add; sum1+=add;\n\n       mul2*=mul; mul3*=mul; mul4*=mul;\n       sum2+=add; sum3+=add; sum4+=add;\n       mul5*=mul; mul1*=mul; mul2*=mul;\n       sum5+=add; sum1+=add; sum2+=add;\n\n       mul3*=mul; mul4*=mul; mul5*=mul;\n       sum3+=add; sum4+=add; sum5+=add;\n   }\n\nAnd the assembly now looks like:\n.L4:\nmulsd    xmm8, xmm3\nmulsd    xmm7, xmm3\nmulsd    xmm6, xmm3\naddsd    xmm13, xmm2\naddsd    xmm12, xmm2\naddsd    xmm11, xmm2\nmulsd    xmm5, xmm3\nmulsd    xmm1, xmm3\nmulsd    xmm8, xmm3\naddsd    xmm10, xmm2\naddsd    xmm9, xmm2\naddsd    xmm13, xmm2\n...\n\n"}

{"question_id":359494,"answer":"In JavaScript, it is generally recommended to use the \"strict equality\" operator (===) when comparing values, rather than the \"loose equality\" operator (==).\r\nUsing the strict equality operator will prevent unexpected type conversions from occurring.\r\nFor example, if you use the loose equality operator to compare the number 0 and the string \"0\", the comparison will return true, because JavaScript will automatically convert the string to a number before making the comparison.\r\n\r\nUsing === instead of == in JavaScript, it will not perform any type coercion and will only return true if the operands have the same type and the same value.\r\n\r\nThere may be some performance benefits to using the strict equality operator in certain cases, as it avoids the need for JavaScript to perform type conversions.

{"question_id":762011,"answer":"In JavaScript, let and var are used to declare variables. However, they have some key differences in how they behave.\r\n\r\nThe var keyword is used to declare a variable in JavaScript, and it is function scoped. This means that a variable declared with var is accessible within the entire function it was declared in, and it's hoisted to the top of the function.\r\n\r\nThe let keyword, introduced in ECMAScript 6, is also used to declare variables but it's block scoped. This means that a variable declared with let is accessible only within the block it was declared in, and it's not hoisted to the top of the block.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important difference between let and var is the temporal dead zone (TDZ). The variable declared with let inside a block cannot be accessed before it is declared. However, variables declared with var are accessible before they are declared, this is due to hoisting.\r\n\r\nIn terms of when to use let instead of var, it's generally recommended to use let when you need a variable that is only accessible within a specific block, such as within a loop or an if statement.

{"question_id":16047306,"answer":"Docker and virtual machines (VMs) are both technologies that allow you to run software in an isolated environment, but they work in different ways.\r\n\r\nA virtual machine is a software implementation of a physical machine that runs on top of a host operating system. Each VM runs its own operating system and has its own virtualized hardware, such as CPU, memory, and storage. This allows you to run multiple operating systems on the same physical machine, but it also makes VMs relatively heavy and resource-intensive.\r\n\r\nDocker, on the other hand, is a containerization technology that allows you to package software and its dependencies into a single container. A container is a lightweight, standalone executable package that includes everything needed to run the software, including the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. Because containers share the host operating system kernel, they are much more lightweight and efficient than VMs.\r\n\r\nWhen deploying software to a Docker image, it eliminates the \"works on my machine\" problem.

{"question_id":487258,"answer":"Big O notation is a way to describe the performance of an algorithm or a program. It's a way to measure how well a program can scale as the amount of data it needs to process increases. The \"O\" stands for \"order\" or \"complexity\" and the number that follows it is a way to indicate how quickly the performance of the algorithm or program will degrade as the size of the input data increases.\r\n\r\nFor example, consider a program that needs to search for an element in an array. If the array is very small, it will take only a few milliseconds for the program to find the element. But if the array is very large, it might take much longer. The Big O notation is used to describe how quickly the program's performance will degrade as the size of the array increases.\r\n\r\nThere are a few common Big O notations that are used to describe the performance of an algorithm or program:\r\n\r\nO(1) means that the program's performance will not degrade at all as the size of the input data increases. This is the best possible performance.\r\nO(n) means that the program's performance will degrade linearly as the size of the input data increases. This is considered to be good performance.\r\nO(n^2) means that the program's performance will degrade exponentially as the size of the input data increases. This is considered to be poor performance.\r\nSo, in simple terms, Big O notation is a way to measure how well a program can scale as the amount of data it needs to process increases. It's a way to compare the performance of different algorithms or programs, so you can choose the best one for a given task. O(1) is considered to be best, O(n) is considered to be good, and O(n^2) is considered to be poor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","target":1,"question":"What does T&& (double ampersand) mean in C++11?\n\nI'd prefer as little formal definition as possible and simple mathematics.\n"}

{"question_id":472906,"answer":"In .NET, strings are encoded as UTF-16, which means each character in a string is represented by two bytes. When you convert a string to a byte array, you need to specify an encoding to determine how the string should be translated into a byte representation. The choice of encoding can affect the resulting byte array, because different encodings may map the same string to different sequences of bytes.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you convert a string to a byte array using the UTF-8 encoding, the resulting byte array will be different than if you use the UTF-16 encoding.\r\n\r\nWhen encrypting a string, you should use a consistent encoding to ensure that the same string is always translated to the same sequence of bytes, so that you can properly encrypt and decrypt it.

{"question_id":22342854,"answer":"Your current algorithm is a basic greedy approach, which only focuses on merging 2 and 4 tiles, but it doesn't consider other factors such as tile placement and maximizing the number of empty tiles.\r\n\r\nA better approach is to use a Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. The algorithm simulates all possible moves and evaluates the best move by assigning scores to each possible game state. The score is calculated based on several factors such as tile placement, number of empty tiles, and the sum of tile values.\r\n\r\nThere are also more sophisticated algorithms such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), which can be used to find the optimal strategy. MCTS is a powerful algorithm that has been used to solve complex games such as chess and Go. However, it can be computationally intensive, so you may need to implement it carefully to ensure it runs efficiently for 2048.","target":1,"question":"How do you find out the caller function in JavaScript?\n\nI have recently stumbled upon the game 2048.

The game terminates when all the boxes are filled and there are no moves that can merge tiles, or you create a tile with a value of 2048.\n\nOne, I need to follow a well-defined strategy to reach the goal. So, I thought of writing a program for it.\n\nMy current algorithm:\n\nwhile (!game_over) {\n    for each possible move:\n        count_no_of_merges_for_2-tiles and 4-tiles\n    choose the move with a large number of merges\n}\n\n\nWhat I am doing is at any point, I will try to merge the tiles with values 2 and 4, that is, I try to have 2 and 4 tiles, as minimum as possible. If I try it this way, all other tiles were automatically getting merged and the strategy seems good.\n\nBut, when I actually use this algorithm, I only get around 4000 points before the game terminates.

{"question_id":1108,"answer":"Indexing in databases is a technique that allows for faster data retrieval operations on a database table by creating a separate data structure (the index) that stores a mapping of values in the indexed columns to their corresponding rows in the table. When a query is executed, the database first looks in the index rather than scanning the entire table, reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed.\r\n\r\nThe basic idea behind indexing is to provide a search tree-like data structure that allows for efficient searching of the data. The most common index structure used in databases is the B-Tree, which provides logarithmic time complexity for most operations. Other index structures such as Hash Tables or Tries can also be used depending on the use case.\r\n\r\nWhen a new record is inserted or an existing record is updated, the index must also be updated to reflect the changes in the underlying data. The cost of maintaining the index needs to be balanced against the benefits of faster query performance.\r\n\r\nIn summary, indexing in databases is a technique used to increase the performance of data retrieval operations by creating a separate data structure that maps values in the indexed columns to their corresponding rows in the table. This allows the database to search the data more efficiently, reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed.","target":1,"question":"#pragma mark in Swift?\n\nGiven that indexing is so important as your data set increases in size, can someone explain how indexing works at a database-agnostic level?\n\nFor information on queries to index a field, check out How do I index a database column.\n"}

{"question_id":1960473,"answer":"The code you have posted uses an object-based approach to remove duplicates from an array. This approach works by adding each element in the array as a property of an object, which can only have unique properties. However, when an element is 0, this approach will not work as expected.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that when you add a property with a value of 0 to an object, it will be converted to a string and become \"0\", which is different from the original number 0. Therefore, when the second loop iterates over the properties of the object, it will include \"0\" in the result array, instead of 0.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, you can use the following code:\r\n\r\ncss\r\n\r\nArray.prototype.getUnique = function() {\r\n  var o = {}, a = [], i, e;\r\n  for (i = 0; e = this[i]; i++) {\r\n    o[e] = 1;\r\n  }\r\n  for (e in o) {\r\n    a.push(+e);\r\n  }\r\n  return a;\r\n};\r\n\r\nHere, we use the unary plus operator (+) to convert the property back to a number before pushing it into the result array.\r\n","target":1,"question":"Multiprocessing vs Threading Python\n\nI have an array of numbers that I need to make sure are unique.

{"question_id":8881291,"answer":"Strings are immutable in Java and once created, they cannot be changed. This means that when you perform operations on a String, it creates a new String object in memory, while the original one remains unchanged. If a password is stored in a String, it remains in memory until garbage collection reclaims the memory. This increases the risk of the password being exposed, as it can be accessed by an attacker who gains access to the memory dump.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, char arrays can be easily wiped out of memory after use, which makes them a safer option for storing passwords. The getPassword() method returns a char array, allowing the password to be cleared from memory after use, reducing the risk of exposure.\r\n\r\nWhile using char[] might feel inconvenient, it is a recommended security measure to protect sensitive information like passwords.","target":1,"question":"Count the number of set bits in a 32-bit integer\n\nIn Swing, the password field has a getPassword() (returns char[]) method instead of the usual getText() (returns String) method.

{"question_id":423379,"answer":"To use a global variable inside a function, you need to use the \"global\" keyword before the variable.

{"question_id":9682092,"answer":"In AngularJS, data binding is achieved through a combination of dirty checking and digest cycles. When a model property is changed, AngularJS adds the property to a \"dirty\" checking list and runs a digest cycle to see if any changes have been made. The digest cycle runs until all model properties have stabilized and there are no more changes to be made. This process is repeated continuously to ensure that the view and model are always in sync.\r\n\r\nAngularJS uses JavaScript getters and setters to track changes to model properties. In modern browsers, these getters and setters are automatically generated for object properties, but in older browsers such as Internet Explorer 6 and 7, AngularJS uses a fallback method based on AngularJS' own implementation of getters and setters, known as \"accessors.\" These accessors are not subject to the same limitations as the native getters and setters, and thus AngularJS can continue to track changes to model properties even in older browsers.","target":1,"question":"What is base 64 encoding used for?\n\nHow does data binding work in the AngularJS framework?\n\nI haven't found technical details on their site.

{"question_id":2067472,"answer":"JSONP (JSON with Padding) is a technique for overcoming the same-origin policy limitations of web browsers, which prevent a web page from making requests to a different domain than the one the web page originated from.\r\n\r\nJSONP works by wrapping the JSON data in a function call, and then returning the data to the web page as a script file. The web page specifies the function name to be called in the URL of the JSONP request. When the server returns the JSON data wrapped in the specified function, the browser executes the function and passes the JSON data as an argument.\r\n\r\nJSONP was created as a workaround to allow communication between domains, when the same-origin policy was preventing regular AJAX (XMLHttpRequest) requests. JSONP was widely used in the early days of the web, before the introduction of CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing), which provides a standard way for a web page to make requests to a different domain.\r\n\r\nYou would use JSONP in situations where you need to make a request to a server in a different domain, and CORS is not supported or is not a suitable solution.

{"question_id":572897,"answer":"JavaScript uses prototype-based programming, which is different from class-based programming in languages like Java or C#. In JavaScript, there is no concept of classes, only objects. When you create an object, it has an internal property called prototype, which is a reference to another object.\r\n\r\nThe prototype property is used to share properties and methods between objects. If you try to access a property or a method on an object and it can't be found, JavaScript will look for it on the object's prototype. This is called prototype chaining, and it is how inheritance is implemented in JavaScript.\r\n\r\nIn the code example you provided, obj is an instance of the built-in Object object. However, you cannot add properties to obj.prototype directly because obj is not a function object. Functions are used to create objects in JavaScript, and they have their own prototype property.\r\n\r\nThe correct way to add properties to the prototype of a custom object type is to create a function object and add properties to its prototype property. In the updated code example, you created a function MyObject and added a test method to its prototype property. This way, when you create an instance of MyObject using var obj2 = new MyObject(), it will have access to the test method via prototype chaining.","target":1,"question":"git recover deleted file where no commit was made after the delete\n\nI'm not that into dynamic programming languages but I've written my fair share of JavaScript code.

{"question_id":35062852,"answer":"You have a good overall understanding of these tools. Here are a few corrections and additional points:\r\n\r\nnpm and bower are both package managers, but bower was originally created to manage front-end dependencies (e.g. libraries and frameworks) while npm was created for managing back-end dependencies. Nowadays, npm has become the de facto package manager for both front-end and back-end JavaScript packages.\r\nGrunt and gulp are both task runners, but gulp uses a more code-based approach, using JavaScript functions and pipelines to automate tasks, while Grunt uses a configuration file to define tasks.\r\nWebpack is not just a task runner, it's a module bundler. It takes your code and dependencies, and generates static assets (bundles) that can be included in a web page. It also has built-in optimization features like minification, code splitting, and tree shaking. The webpack-dev-server is a development server that uses webpack under the hood, and provides features like hot reloading and automatic bundling on changes.\r\nYou would use browserify if you want to use node modules in the browser, for example if you want to use a node module that wasn't designed for use in the browser. It allows you to package your node modules and their dependencies into a single bundle that can be included in a web page, and provides a compatible require function for those modules to use.\r\nYou would use gulp or Grunt over npm + plugins when you have complex tasks that require multiple steps and\/or multiple plugins. The plugins available through npm can be used with task runners to automate these complex tasks. For example, you could use gulp to compile your Sass into CSS, minify your CSS and JavaScript, and then use webpack to bundle your code.\r\nThere is no one-size-fits-all answer for when you need to use a combination of these tools. It depends on the specific requirements of your project and your personal preferences. However, a common combination is to use npm for managing packages, gulp or Grunt for automating tasks, and webpack for bundling your code for the browser.","target":1,"question":"Why should C++ programmers minimize use of 'new'?\n\nI'm trying to summarize my knowledge about the most popular JavaScript package managers, bundlers, and task runners. Please correct me if I'm wrong:\n\n\nnpm & bower are package managers. They just download the dependencies and don't know how to build projects on their own. What they know is to call webpack\/gulp\/grunt after fetching all the dependencies.\nbower is like npm, but builds a flattened dependency trees (unlike npm which does it recursively). Meaning npm fetches the dependencies for each dependency (may fetch the same a few times), while bower expects you to manually include sub-dependencies. Sometimes bower and npm are used together for front-end and back-end respectively (since each megabyte might matter in front-end).\ngrunt and gulp are task runners to automate everything that can be automated (i.e. compile CSS\/Sass, optimize images, make a bundle and minify\/transpile it).\ngrunt vs. gulp (is like maven vs. gradle or configuration vs. code). Grunt is based on configuring separate independent tasks, each task opens\/handles\/closes file. Gulp requires less amount of code and is based on Node streams, which allows it to build pipe chains (w\/o reopening the same file) and makes it faster. \nwebpack (webpack-dev-server) - for me it's a task runner with hot reloading of changes which allows you to forget about all JS\/CSS watchers. \nnpm\/bower + plugins may replace task runners. Their abilities often intersect so there are different implications if you need to use gulp\/grunt over npm + plugins. But task runners are definitely better for complex tasks (e.g. \"on each build create bundle, transpile from ES6 to ES5, run it at all browsers emulators, make screenshots and deploy to dropbox through ftp\").\nbrowserify allows packaging node modules for browsers. browserify vs node's require is actually AMD vs CommonJS.\n\n\nQuestions:\n\n\nWhat is webpack & webpack-dev-server? Official documentation says it's a module bundler but for me it's just a task runner. What's the difference?\nWhere would you use browserify? Can't we do the same with node\/ES6 imports? \nWhen would you use gulp\/grunt over npm + plugins?\nPlease provide examples when you need to use a combination\n\n"}

{"question_id":332030,"answer":"static_cast is used for type casting between compatible data types. It can perform conversions such as int to float, derived class to base class, and void pointer to any other pointer type. static_cast performs only basic type checking and is used for low-level conversions that the programmer fully understands and trusts.\r\n\r\ndynamic_cast is used for type casting between related classes in an inheritance hierarchy. It performs a runtime check to ensure that the type being cast to is indeed the correct type. If the cast fails, a nullptr is returned. dynamic_cast is typically used when working with polymorphic objects and is a safer alternative to static_cast in such cases.\r\n\r\nconst_cast is used to remove or add the const qualifier from a variable. This can be useful when passing a const argument to a function that does not accept a const argument.\r\n\r\nreinterpret_cast is used for low-level bit manipulation and conversions that do not preserve the underlying value. reinterpret_cast can be used to convert a pointer of one type to a pointer of another type, even if the types are not related. This can result in undefined behavior and should be used with caution.\r\n\r\nThe C-style cast (type)value is a shorthand for static_cast, but also includes reinterpret_cast and const_cast. It is often used for quick and dirty type casting, but is considered less safe than the other casting methods as it can cause unexpected behavior and make code harder to understand and maintain.\r\n\r\nThe function-style cast type(value) is a shorthand for static_cast.\r\n\r\nWhen deciding which cast to use, it's important to consider the safety of the operation, the compatibility of the data types, and the purpose of the cast. If the purpose is to convert between compatible data types, use static_cast. If the purpose is to perform a type check on an object in an inheritance hierarchy, use dynamic_cast. If the purpose is to modify the const qualifier, use const_cast.

{"question_id":6430448,"answer":"Compilers use a set of optimization techniques to make code run faster and use fewer resources. However, the set of optimizations that a compiler uses is limited, and some optimizations may not be possible or may have unintended side effects. In the case of the expression aaaaaa, it is not trivial for the compiler to recognize that it can be optimized to (aaa)(aaa). This optimization requires the compiler to be able to recognize that the expression can be simplified, to understand the associative property of multiplication, and to reorder the operations in a way that results in fewer instructions. While this optimization is possible, it may not be high on the list of priorities for the compiler developers.\r\nIn general, compilers are designed to handle a large set of inputs, and may not be optimized for specific cases like this one. If performance is a concern, it may be helpful to manually optimize the code, or to consider using a different compiler.","target":1,"question":"Can HTML checkboxes be set to readonly?\n\nI am doing some numerical optimization on a scientific application. One thing I noticed is that GCC will optimize the call pow(a,2) by compiling it into a*a, but the call pow(a,6) is not optimized and will actually call the library function pow, which greatly slows down the performance. (In contrast, Intel C++ Compiler, executable icc, will eliminate the library call for pow(a,6).) \n\nWhat I am curious about is that when I replaced pow(a,6) with a*a*a*a*a*a using GCC 4.5.1 and options \"-O3 -lm -funroll-loops -msse4\", it uses 5 mulsd instructions:\n\nmovapd  %xmm14, %xmm13\nmulsd   %xmm14, %xmm13\nmulsd   %xmm14, %xmm13\nmulsd   %xmm14, %xmm13\nmulsd   %xmm14, %xmm13\nmulsd   %xmm14, %xmm13\n\n\nwhile if I write (a*a*a)*(a*a*a), it will produce\n\nmovapd  %xmm14, %xmm13\nmulsd   %xmm14, %xmm13\nmulsd   %xmm14, %xmm13\nmulsd   %xmm13, %xmm13\n\n\nwhich reduces the number of multiply instructions to 3. icc has similar behavior.\n\nWhy do compilers not recognize this optimization trick?\n"}

{"question_id":15666048,"answer":"In AngularJS, Service, Provider, and Factory are all different ways to create reusable objects that can be shared across multiple components in an application.\r\n\r\n    Service: A Service is a simple function that is created using the .service method. It is the simplest way to create a reusable object, and it is mainly used for data and logic that needs to be shared between multiple controllers.\r\n\r\n    Factory: A Factory is a more flexible way to create reusable objects, as it can return any value, including objects, functions, and primitive values. It is created using the .factory method, and it is a more commonly used option as it provides more control over the object that is returned.\r\n\r\n    Provider: A Provider is the most powerful and flexible way to create reusable objects in AngularJS, as it allows you to configure the object before it is created and returned to the consumer. It is created using the .provider method, and it is mainly used for objects that require configuration, such as a service that needs to be configured with an API endpoint.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while Service and Factory provide simple and flexible ways to create reusable objects, Provider offers the most control over the configuration and creation of these objects.\r\n","target":1,"question":"What\u2019s the difference between \"Array()\" and \"[]\" while declaring a JavaScript array?\n\nWhat are the differences between a Service, Provider and Factory in AngularJS?\n"}

{"question_id":1711631,"answer":"There are several ways to improve the INSERT performance of SQLite:\r\n\r\nUse transactions: wrap multiple INSERT statements into a single transaction, this can greatly improve the bulk insert performance.\r\nUse prepared statements: compile SQL statements once and execute them multiple times, this can save the overhead of parsing SQL statements multiple times.\r\nUse batch processing: group multiple INSERT statements into a single string and execute it as a single SQL statement, this can reduce the overhead of making multiple trips to the database.\r\nUse the sqlite3_exec function: this function is designed for executing multiple SQL statements at once, which can reduce the overhead of making multiple trips to the database.\r\nIncrease the cache size: the cache size affects the performance of SQLite, increasing the cache size can improve the INSERT performance.\r\nUse the WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mode: WAL mode can improve the write performance of SQLite, it's recommended to use it if you need high INSERT performance.\r\nConsider using other databases: If the performance of SQLite is still not sufficient, consider using other databases, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, which may provide better performance for your use case.","target":1,"question":"What is the role of the bias in neural networks?\n\nOptimizing SQLite is tricky. Bulk-insert performance of a C application can vary from 85 inserts per second to over 96,000 inserts per second!\nBackground: We are using SQLite as part of a desktop application. We have large amounts of configuration data stored in XML files that are parsed and loaded into an SQLite database for further processing when the application is initialized. SQLite is ideal for this situation because it's fast, it requires no specialized configuration, and the database is stored on disk as a single file.\nRationale: Initially I was disappointed with the performance I was seeing. It turns-out that the performance of SQLite can vary significantly (both for bulk-inserts and selects) depending on how the database is configured and how you're using the API. It was not a trivial matter to figure out what all of the options and techniques were, so I thought it prudent to create this community wiki entry to share the results with Stack\u00a0Overflow readers in order to save others the trouble of the same investigations.\nThe Experiment: Rather than simply talking about performance tips in the general sense (i.e. \"Use a transaction!\"), I thought it best to write some C code and actually measure the impact of various options. We're going to start with some simple data:\n\nA 28 MB TAB-delimited text file (approximately 865,000 records) of the complete transit schedule for the city of Toronto\nMy test machine is a 3.60 GHz P4 running Windows XP.\nThe code is compiled with Visual C++ 2005 as \"Release\" with \"Full Optimization\" (\/Ox) and Favor Fast Code (\/Ot).\nI'm using the SQLite \"Amalgamation\", compiled directly into my test application. The SQLite version I happen to have is a bit older (3.6.7), but I suspect these results will be comparable to the latest release (please leave a comment if you think otherwise).\n\nLet's write some code!\nThe Code: A simple C program that reads the text file line-by-line, splits the string into values and then inserts the data into an SQLite database. In this \"baseline\" version of the code, the database is created, but we won't actually insert data:\n\/*************************************************************\n    Baseline code to experiment with SQLite performance.\n\n    Input data is a 28 MB TAB-delimited text file of the\n    complete Toronto Transit System schedule\/route info\n    from http:\/\/www.toronto.ca\/open\/datasets\/ttc-routes\/\n\n**************************************************************\/\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <time.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include \"sqlite3.h\"\n\n#define INPUTDATA \"C:\\\\TTC_schedule_scheduleitem_10-27-2009.txt\"\n#define DATABASE \"c:\\\\TTC_schedule_scheduleitem_10-27-2009.sqlite\"\n#define TABLE \"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS TTC (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, Route_ID TEXT, Branch_Code TEXT, Version INTEGER, Stop INTEGER, Vehicle_Index INTEGER, Day Integer, Time TEXT)\"\n#define BUFFER_SIZE 256\n\nint main(int argc, char **argv) {\n\n    sqlite3 * db;\n    sqlite3_stmt * stmt;\n    char * sErrMsg = 0;\n    char * tail = 0;\n    int nRetCode;\n    int n = 0;\n\n    clock_t cStartClock;\n\n    FILE * pFile;\n    char sInputBuf [BUFFER_SIZE] = \"\\0\";\n\n    char * sRT = 0;  \/* Route *\/\n    char * sBR = 0;  \/* Branch *\/\n    char * sVR = 0;  \/* Version *\/\n    char * sST = 0;  \/* Stop Number *\/\n    char * sVI = 0;  \/* Vehicle *\/\n    char * sDT = 0;  \/* Date *\/\n    char * sTM = 0;  \/* Time *\/\n\n    char sSQL [BUFFER_SIZE] = \"\\0\";\n\n    \/*********************************************\/\n    \/* Open the Database and create the Schema *\/\n    sqlite3_open(DATABASE, &db);\n    sqlite3_exec(db, TABLE, NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);\n\n    \/*********************************************\/\n    \/* Open input file and import into Database*\/\n    cStartClock = clock();\n\n    pFile = fopen (INPUTDATA,\"r\");\n    while (!feof(pFile)) {\n\n        fgets (sInputBuf, BUFFER_SIZE, pFile);\n\n        sRT = strtok (sInputBuf, \"\\t\");     \/* Get Route *\/\n        sBR = strtok (NULL, \"\\t\");            \/* Get Branch *\/\n        sVR = strtok (NULL, \"\\t\");            \/* Get Version *\/\n        sST = strtok (NULL, \"\\t\");            \/* Get Stop Number *\/\n        sVI = strtok (NULL, \"\\t\");            \/* Get Vehicle *\/\n        sDT = strtok (NULL, \"\\t\");            \/* Get Date *\/\n        sTM = strtok (NULL, \"\\t\");            \/* Get Time *\/\n\n        \/* ACTUAL INSERT WILL GO HERE *\/\n\n        n++;\n    }\n    fclose (pFile);\n\n    printf(\"Imported %d records in %4.2f seconds\\n\", n, (clock() - cStartClock) \/ (double)CLOCKS_PER_SEC);\n\n    sqlite3_close(db);\n    return 0;\n}\n\n\nThe \"Control\"\nRunning the code as-is doesn't actually perform any database operations, but it will give us an idea of how fast the raw C file I\/O and string processing operations are.\n\nImported 864913 records in 0.94\nseconds\n\nGreat! We can do 920,000 inserts per second, provided we don't actually do any inserts :-)\n\nThe \"Worst-Case-Scenario\"\nWe're going to generate the SQL string using the values read from the file and invoke that SQL operation using sqlite3_exec:\nsprintf(sSQL, \"INSERT INTO TTC VALUES (NULL, '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s')\", sRT, sBR, sVR, sST, sVI, sDT, sTM);\nsqlite3_exec(db, sSQL, NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);\n\nThis is going to be slow because the SQL will be compiled into VDBE code for every insert and every insert will happen in its own transaction. How slow?\n\nImported 864913 records in 9933.61\nseconds\n\nYikes! 2 hours and 45 minutes! That's only 85 inserts per second.\nUsing a Transaction\nBy default, SQLite will evaluate every INSERT \/ UPDATE statement within a unique transaction. If performing a large number of inserts, it's advisable to wrap your operation in a transaction:\nsqlite3_exec(db, \"BEGIN TRANSACTION\", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);\n\npFile = fopen (INPUTDATA,\"r\");\nwhile (!feof(pFile)) {\n\n    ...\n\n}\nfclose (pFile);\n\nsqlite3_exec(db, \"END TRANSACTION\", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);\n\n\nImported 864913 records in 38.03\nseconds\n\nThat's better. Simply wrapping all of our inserts in a single transaction improved our performance to 23,000 inserts per second.\nUsing a Prepared Statement\nUsing a transaction was a huge improvement, but recompiling the SQL statement for every insert doesn't make sense if we using the same SQL over-and-over. Let's use sqlite3_prepare_v2 to compile our SQL statement once and then bind our parameters to that statement using sqlite3_bind_text:\n\/* Open input file and import into the database *\/\ncStartClock = clock();\n\nsprintf(sSQL, \"INSERT INTO TTC VALUES (NULL, @RT, @BR, @VR, @ST, @VI, @DT, @TM)\");\nsqlite3_prepare_v2(db,  sSQL, BUFFER_SIZE, &stmt, &tail);\n\nsqlite3_exec(db, \"BEGIN TRANSACTION\", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);\n\npFile = fopen (INPUTDATA,\"r\");\nwhile (!feof(pFile)) {\n\n    fgets (sInputBuf, BUFFER_SIZE, pFile);\n\n    sRT = strtok (sInputBuf, \"\\t\");   \/* Get Route *\/\n    sBR = strtok (NULL, \"\\t\");        \/* Get Branch *\/\n    sVR = strtok (NULL, \"\\t\");        \/* Get Version *\/\n    sST = strtok (NULL, \"\\t\");        \/* Get Stop Number *\/\n    sVI = strtok (NULL, \"\\t\");        \/* Get Vehicle *\/\n    sDT = strtok (NULL, \"\\t\");        \/* Get Date *\/\n    sTM = strtok (NULL, \"\\t\");        \/* Get Time *\/\n\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 1, sRT, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 2, sBR, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 3, sVR, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 4, sST, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 5, sVI, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 6, sDT, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 7, sTM, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);\n\n    sqlite3_step(stmt);\n\n    sqlite3_clear_bindings(stmt);\n    sqlite3_reset(stmt);\n\n    n++;\n}\nfclose (pFile);\n\nsqlite3_exec(db, \"END TRANSACTION\", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);\n\nprintf(\"Imported %d records in %4.2f seconds\\n\", n, (clock() - cStartClock) \/ (double)CLOCKS_PER_SEC);\n\nsqlite3_finalize(stmt);\nsqlite3_close(db);\n\nreturn 0;\n\n\nImported 864913 records in 16.27\nseconds\n\nNice! There's a little bit more code (don't forget to call sqlite3_clear_bindings and sqlite3_reset), but we've more than doubled our performance to 53,000 inserts per second.\nPRAGMA synchronous = OFF\nBy default, SQLite will pause after issuing a OS-level write command. This guarantees that the data is written to the disk. By setting synchronous = OFF, we are instructing SQLite to simply hand-off the data to the OS for writing and then continue. There's a chance that the database file may become corrupted if the computer suffers a catastrophic crash (or power failure) before the data is written to the platter:\n\/* Open the database and create the schema *\/\nsqlite3_open(DATABASE, &db);\nsqlite3_exec(db, TABLE, NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);\nsqlite3_exec(db, \"PRAGMA synchronous = OFF\", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);\n\n\nImported 864913 records in 12.41\nseconds\n\nThe improvements are now smaller, but we're up to 69,600 inserts per second.\nPRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY\nConsider storing the rollback journal in memory by evaluating PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY. Your transaction will be faster, but if you lose power or your program crashes during a transaction you database could be left in a corrupt state with a partially-completed transaction:\n\/* Open the database and create the schema *\/\nsqlite3_open(DATABASE, &db);\nsqlite3_exec(db, TABLE, NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);\nsqlite3_exec(db, \"PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY\", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);\n\n\nImported 864913 records in 13.50\nseconds\n\nA little slower than the previous optimization at 64,000 inserts per second.\nPRAGMA synchronous = OFF and PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY\nLet's combine the previous two optimizations. It's a little more risky (in case of a crash), but we're just importing data (not running a bank):\n\/* Open the database and create the schema *\/\nsqlite3_open(DATABASE, &db);\nsqlite3_exec(db, TABLE, NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);\nsqlite3_exec(db, \"PRAGMA synchronous = OFF\", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);\nsqlite3_exec(db, \"PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY\", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);\n\n\nImported 864913 records in 12.00\nseconds\n\nFantastic! We're able to do 72,000 inserts per second.\nUsing an In-Memory Database\nJust for kicks, let's build upon all of the previous optimizations and redefine the database filename so we're working entirely in RAM:\n#define DATABASE \":memory:\"\n\n\nImported 864913 records in 10.94\nseconds\n\nIt's not super-practical to store our database in RAM, but it's impressive that we can perform 79,000 inserts per second.\nRefactoring C Code\nAlthough not specifically an SQLite improvement, I don't like the extra char* assignment operations in the while loop. Let's quickly refactor that code to pass the output of strtok() directly into sqlite3_bind_text(), and let the compiler try to speed things up for us:\npFile = fopen (INPUTDATA,\"r\");\nwhile (!feof(pFile)) {\n\n    fgets (sInputBuf, BUFFER_SIZE, pFile);\n\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 1, strtok (sInputBuf, \"\\t\"), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT); \/* Get Route *\/\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 2, strtok (NULL, \"\\t\"), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    \/* Get Branch *\/\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 3, strtok (NULL, \"\\t\"), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    \/* Get Version *\/\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 4, strtok (NULL, \"\\t\"), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    \/* Get Stop Number *\/\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 5, strtok (NULL, \"\\t\"), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    \/* Get Vehicle *\/\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 6, strtok (NULL, \"\\t\"), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    \/* Get Date *\/\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 7, strtok (NULL, \"\\t\"), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    \/* Get Time *\/\n\n    sqlite3_step(stmt);        \/* Execute the SQL Statement *\/\n    sqlite3_clear_bindings(stmt);    \/* Clear bindings *\/\n    sqlite3_reset(stmt);        \/* Reset VDBE *\/\n\n    n++;\n}\nfclose (pFile);\n\nNote: We are back to using a real database file. In-memory databases are fast, but not necessarily practical\n\nImported 864913 records in 8.94\nseconds\n\nA slight refactoring to the string processing code used in our parameter binding has allowed us to perform 96,700 inserts per second. I think it's safe to say that this is plenty fast. As we start to tweak other variables (i.e. page size, index creation, etc.) this will be our benchmark.\n\nSummary (so far)\nI hope you're still with me! The reason we started down this road is that bulk-insert performance varies so wildly with SQLite, and it's not always obvious what changes need to be made to speed-up our operation. Using the same compiler (and compiler options), the same version of SQLite and the same data we've optimized our code and our usage of SQLite to go from a worst-case scenario of 85 inserts per second to over 96,000 inserts per second!\n\nCREATE INDEX then INSERT vs. INSERT then CREATE INDEX\nBefore we start measuring SELECT performance, we know that we'll be creating indices. It's been suggested in one of the answers below that when doing bulk inserts, it is faster to create the index after the data has been inserted (as opposed to creating the index first then inserting the data). Let's try:\nCreate Index then Insert Data\nsqlite3_exec(db, \"CREATE  INDEX 'TTC_Stop_Index' ON 'TTC' ('Stop')\", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);\nsqlite3_exec(db, \"BEGIN TRANSACTION\", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);\n...\n\n\nImported 864913 records in 18.13\nseconds\n\nInsert Data then Create Index\n...\nsqlite3_exec(db, \"END TRANSACTION\", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);\nsqlite3_exec(db, \"CREATE  INDEX 'TTC_Stop_Index' ON 'TTC' ('Stop')\", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);\n\n\nImported 864913 records in 13.66\nseconds\n\nAs expected, bulk-inserts are slower if one column is indexed, but it does make a difference if the index is created after the data is inserted. Our no-index baseline is 96,000 inserts per second. Creating the index first then inserting data gives us 47,700 inserts per second, whereas inserting the data first then creating the index gives us 63,300 inserts per second.\n\nI'd gladly take suggestions for other scenarios to try... And will be compiling similar data for SELECT queries soon.\n"}

{"question_id":1132941,"answer":"The reason for binding the default argument at function definition and not at function execution is to allow for efficient implementation of the language and consistency in the language design. The default value for an argument is evaluated when the function is defined and not re-evaluated every time the function is called. This is because the default argument is meant to be a static value and not a value that changes with each function call. This behavior makes the language more consistent, as all parts of a function definition are evaluated when the function is defined and not when it is executed. However, it can lead to unexpected results when the default argument is mutable, as demonstrated in the example you provided.","target":1,"question":"What's the difference between map() and flatMap() methods in Java 8?\n\nAnyone tinkering with Python long enough has been bitten (or torn to pieces) by the following issue:\ndef foo(a=[]):\n    a.append(5)\n    return a\n\nPython novices would expect this function called with no parameter to always return a list with only one element: [5].

I replied that the behavior had an underlying explanation, and it is indeed very puzzling and unexpected if you don't understand the internals. However, I was not able to answer (to myself) the following question: what is the reason for binding the default argument at function definition, and not at function execution? I doubt the experienced behavior has a practical use (who really used static variables in C, without breeding bugs?)\nEdit:\nBaczek made an interesting example. Together with most of your comments and Utaal's in particular, I elaborated further:\n>>> def a():\n...     print(\"a executed\")\n...     return []\n... \n>>>            \n>>> def b(x=a()):\n...     x.append(5)\n...     print(x)\n... \na executed\n>>> b()\n[5]\n>>> b()\n[5, 5]\n\nTo me, it seems that the design decision was relative to where to put the scope of parameters: inside the function, or \"together\" with it?\nDoing the binding inside the function would mean that x is effectively bound to the specified default when the function is called, not defined, something that would present a deep flaw: the def line would be \"hybrid\" in the sense that part of the binding (of the function object) would happen at definition, and part (assignment of default parameters) at function invocation time.\nThe actual behavior is more consistent: everything of that line gets evaluated when that line is executed, meaning at function definition.\n"}

On the other hand, a static class is initialized when the program starts.\r\n\r\nDependency Injection: A singleton class can be used in Dependency Injection, whereas a static class cannot be used in DI as it cannot be instantiated.\r\n\r\nIn summary, while both static classes and singletons serve the purpose of providing a single instance, singletons offer more flexibility and are more suited for complex cases where inheritance and lazy initialization are required.","target":1,"question":"How to efficiently concatenate strings in go\n\nWhat real (i.e. practical) difference exists between a static class and a singleton pattern?\n\nBoth can be invoked without instantiation, both provide only one \"Instance\" and neither of them is thread-safe.

{"question_id":663171,"answer":"You can extract a substring from a string in Python by using slicing.

{"question_id":6470651,"answer":"Creating a memory leak in Java is possible if objects are kept in memory, even though they are no longer needed by the application. This can happen in several ways, including:\r\n\r\nHolding onto references to objects that are no longer needed: For example, creating an object and storing it in a static field, even after it is no longer needed.\r\n\r\nCreating circular references: This happens when objects reference each other, creating a cycle that cannot be broken by the garbage collector.\r\n\r\nFailing to close resources: Failing to close resources such as InputStreams, OutputStreams, and database connections can prevent the garbage collector from freeing the memory associated with these resources.\r\n\r\nCaching: Caching objects for an extended period of time, even after they are no longer needed, can lead to a memory leak.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of a memory leak caused by holding onto references to objects that are no longer needed:\r\n\r\njava\r\n\r\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\r\nimport java.util.List;\r\n\r\npublic class MemoryLeakExample {\r\n  private static List<byte[]> cache = new ArrayList<>();\r\n\r\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n    while (true) {\r\n      cache.add(new byte[1024 * 1024]);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nThis code continuously adds new byte arrays to the cache list, but it never removes them, which will result in a memory leak.

I have a fairly heavily-used class, call it Jenine. I recently (and, perhaps, callously) relocated Jenine from one namespace to another. I thought we were ready - I thought it was time. The new Jenine was better in every way - she had lost some code bloat, she had decoupled herself from a few vestigial class relationships, and she had finally come home to the namespace that she had always secretly known in her heart was the one she truly belonged to. She was among her own kind.\n\nUnfortunately, Flash would have none of that. Perhaps it had formed an attachment. Perhaps it didn't want Jenine to be decoupled. Either way, it clung to the old, perfect version of Jenine in its memory. It refused to move on. It ignored her (function) calls. It tried to forget her new, public interfaces. Instead, every instance of Jenine that it constructed was always a copy of the old version, down to its classpath:\n\nvar jenineInstance:Jenine = new Jenine();\ntrace( getQualifiedClassName(jenineInstance));\n\/\/ Should print: com.newnamespace.subspace::Jenine\n\/\/ Prints: com.oldnamespace.subspace::Jenine\n\/\/ Ah, young love!\n\n\nWe fought.

{"question_id":285177,"answer":"Yes, it's possible to call one constructor from another constructor within the same class in Java. To do this, you can use the this keyword followed by the constructor signature. The this keyword refers to the current object and the constructor call must be the first statement in the constructor. Here is an example:\r\n\r\njava\r\n\r\nclass Example {\r\n    int x;\r\n    int y;\r\n\r\n    Example(int x) {\r\n        this(x, 0);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    Example(int x, int y) {\r\n        this.x = x;\r\n        this.y = y;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nThe best way to call another constructor is to use this as shown in the example, as it clearly indicates that you are calling a constructor of the same class.

{"question_id":2307283,"answer":"O(log n) means that the growth rate of the algorithm is logarithmic. It means that the size of the input affects the growth of the algorithm such that the amount of operations performed increases logarithmically with the size of the input.\r\n\r\nFor example, when you are searching for an item in a sorted array using a binary search algorithm, you keep dividing the search space in half until you find the item or determine that it is not in the array. The number of operations required to find the item is proportional to the logarithm of the size of the array. This is why binary search is considered to have a time complexity of O(log n).\r\n\r\nIn the case of the height of a complete binary tree, it means that the height of the tree is proportional to the logarithm of the total number of nodes in the tree. This is because in a complete binary tree, the number of nodes in each level is multiplied by 2 as you move down the levels. The logarithmic relationship between the height of the tree and the number of nodes ensures that searching and traversing operations in the tree are efficient.","target":1,"question":"How to disable a link using only CSS\n\nI am learning about Big O Notation running times and amortized times.

{"question_id":3740152,"answer":"To change permissions for a folder and its subfolders\/files, you can use the following command:\r\n\r\nbash\r\n\r\nchmod -R 755 \/opt\/lampp\/htdocs\r\nThe -R option stands for \"recursive\" and it will apply the permission changes to the folder and all its subdirectories and files. The 755 in the command represents the permissions for the owner (user), the group, and other users respectively, in binary format.\r\n\r\nTo set 755 permissions for new folders and files automatically, you can use the umask command. For example:\r\n\r\nbash\r\n\r\numask 002\r\nThis sets the default file creation mask to 002, which will result in files being created with permissions 755 (i.e., rwxr-xr-x).

{"question_id":16647069,"answer":"Vagrant and Docker are both popular tools for creating isolated environments, but they have different purposes and design goals:\r\n\r\nVagrant:\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n\r\nEasy to use and set up, with a user-friendly interface.\r\nProvides a full virtual machine environment that can run any software or OS, which makes it easier to match production environments.\r\nOffers greater flexibility and configurability, as you have full access to the virtual machine.\r\nCons:\r\n\r\nMore resource-intensive, as it runs a full virtual machine that needs its own resources such as CPU, memory, and disk space.\r\nSlower to start and stop, as it takes time to spin up and shut down a full virtual machine.\r\nDocker:\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n\r\nLightweight, as it uses containers instead of full virtual machines, which requires fewer resources.\r\nFast to start and stop, as containers can be created and destroyed quickly.\r\nGood for microservices architecture, where each service can run in its own isolated container.\r\nCons:\r\n\r\nNot as flexible as Vagrant, as you don't have full access to the host operating system.\r\nMore challenging to set up and use, as it requires a deeper understanding of containers and the underlying technology.\r\nIn conclusion, the choice between Vagrant and Docker depends on the specific requirements of your project and your preferences as a developer. If you need a more flexible and configurable environment, and don't mind the overhead of running a full virtual machine, then Vagrant might be a better choice.

{"question_id":8547778,"answer":"The difference in performance between the two loops is due to cache behavior. When multiple arrays are stored in contiguous memory, as in the first loop, accessing them can result in cache eviction. That is, as the processor tries to access elements of different arrays stored in contiguous memory, some elements of arrays may get evicted from the cache, leading to a cache miss and resulting in slower access. On the other hand, when arrays are stored in separate memory, there is less chance of cache eviction, leading to faster access. Additionally, the cache can handle data in the form of cache lines, and accessing data in separate arrays can result in more cache-friendly access patterns. This can result in better performance.","target":1,"question":"What is a mutex?\n\nSuppose a1, b1, c1, and d1 point to heap memory, and my numerical code has the following core loop.\nconst int n = 100000;\n\nfor (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {\n    a1[j] += b1[j];\n    c1[j] += d1[j];\n}\n\nThis loop is executed 10,000 times via another outer for loop.

{"question_id":541487,"answer":"Yes, there are significant differences between \"implements Runnable\" and \"extends Thread\" in Java.\r\n\r\nThe primary difference is that extending the Thread class creates a new class that is a subclass of Thread, and therefore can only be used to create objects of that class, whereas implementing the Runnable interface allows the creation of objects that can be passed as a target to a Thread object.\r\n\r\nThis means that if you extend the Thread class, you cannot extend any other class, as Java does not support multiple inheritance. On the other hand, implementing the Runnable interface allows you to take advantage of multiple inheritance, as a class can implement multiple interfaces.\r\n\r\nAnother difference is that it is generally considered to be better practice to implement the Runnable interface because it leads to cleaner, more modular code. Additionally, the Runnable interface is more flexible, as it allows you to pass a single Runnable object to multiple threads.\r\n\r\nIn summary, if you want to create a reusable component that can be run as a thread, use the Runnable interface.

{"question_id":817856,"answer":"A ThreadLocal variable is a variable that is specific to the current thread. It allows you to store and access values that are local to the current thread of execution. This can be useful when you have multiple threads running in your application and you want to keep track of data that is specific to each thread.\r\n\r\nHere are a few scenarios where you might use a ThreadLocal variable:\r\n\r\n    When you have shared resources: If you have a shared resource that multiple threads are accessing, you can use a ThreadLocal variable to store thread-specific data that is associated with the shared resource. This can help you keep track of the state of the resource for each thread.\r\n\r\n    When you want to store thread-specific context: If you need to store context data that is specific to the current thread, you can use a ThreadLocal variable to do so. This context data can be used throughout the lifetime of the thread to keep track of data that is specific to that thread.\r\n\r\n    When you want to store thread-specific configuration data: If you have a configuration setting that is specific to the current thread, you can use a ThreadLocal variable to store it. This can be useful if you have a multi-threaded application and each thread requires different configuration data.\r\n\r\nIn C#, you can use a ThreadLocal variable by declaring a static ThreadLocal object, and then storing and accessing values for that object in your code. Here's an example:\r\n\r\ncsharp\r\n\r\nusing System;\r\nusing System.Threading;\r\n\r\nclass Program\r\n{\r\n    static ThreadLocal<int> _localData = new ThreadLocal<int>(() => 0);\r\n\r\n    static void Main(string[] args)\r\n    {\r\n        _localData.Value = 42;\r\n        Console.WriteLine(\"ThreadLocal value for current thread: {0}\", _localData.Value);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nIn this example, the ThreadLocal object is declared as a static variable, and the value of the ThreadLocal object can be accessed and modified using the Value property. The value of the ThreadLocal object is local to the current thread of execution, so different threads can have different values for the same ThreadLocal object.","target":1,"question":"In a Bash script, how can I exit the entire script if a certain condition occurs?\n\nWhen should I use a ThreadLocal variable?\n\nHow is it used?\n"}

{"question_id":36827659,"answer":"There are several ways to address single event upsets (SEUs) in software when deploying in highly radioactive environments:\r\n\r\n    Error Correction Codes (ECC): ECC is a powerful technique for detecting and correcting soft errors. You can implement ECC at the memory level, and also at the processor level. ECC can detect and correct many types of memory errors.\r\n\r\n    Checkpoint\/Restart: One way to handle SEUs is to periodically checkpoint the state of the application and restart it if an error is detected. This allows the application to continue running, even if there are errors.\r\n\r\n    Code Hardening: Another way to reduce the effects of SEUs is to harden the code. This can be done by implementing techniques such as stack protection, address space randomization, and read-only data segments.\r\n\r\n    Avoiding Dynamic Memory Allocation: Dynamic memory allocation can cause problems in an environment that is susceptible to SEUs. One way to reduce the effects of SEUs is to avoid dynamic memory allocation and use statically allocated memory instead.\r\n\r\n    Use Robust Libraries: You can also use robust libraries that are designed to handle SEUs.

{"question_id":729692,"answer":"The reason why text files should end with a newline is because of the way that text editors, utilities, and programming languages typically handle newlines.\r\n\r\nMany text editors and utilities, such as cat on Unix-like systems, expect each line of a text file to be terminated with a newline character (\\n). If a file does not end with a newline, then these tools may not display the final line of the file, or may display it in a way that is not intended.\r\n\r\nIn addition, many programming languages, such as Python, treat a newline as a separator between lines of text when reading from a file. If a text file does not end with a newline, then the last line of the file may not be processed correctly when it is read by a program.\r\n\r\nTherefore, to ensure consistent and correct behavior across different text editors, utilities, and programming languages, it is a best practice to end all text files with a newline.\r\n","target":1,"question":"Clearing localStorage in javascript?\n\nI assume everyone here is familiar with the adage that all text files should end with a newline.

{"question_id":1780599,"answer":"POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface) is a set of standards for operating system interfaces that were developed by the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) to provide a consistent environment for software development across different operating systems, including Unix, Linux, and macOS.\r\n\r\nThe need for POSIX arose from the fragmentation of the Unix operating system into different proprietary implementations that were incompatible with each other. This made it difficult for software developers to write applications that could run on multiple Unix systems, since they had to take into account the differences between each system's APIs and user interfaces.\r\n\r\nPOSIX defines a standard set of system calls, library functions, and user interface conventions that must be supported by a Unix-like operating system in order to be considered POSIX-compliant. By providing a standard interface, POSIX allows software developers to write code that can be easily ported between different Unix systems, without having to worry about differences in system-specific APIs and user interfaces.\r\n\r\nPOSIX is important because it provides a way for developers to write portable, cross-platform software that can run on different Unix systems with minimal modification.

{"question_id":5195452,"answer":"WebSockets and Server-Sent Events (SSE) are both technologies that allow a server to push data to a client, but they have different use cases and design goals.\r\n\r\nWebSockets are designed for real-time, two-way communication between a client and a server. They provide a full-duplex channel, meaning that data can be sent in both directions simultaneously, and they support a wider range of data types than SSE. WebSockets use a single, long-lived connection between the client and the server, and the connection remains open until either the client or the server closes it. This makes WebSockets suitable for use cases where low latency and high bandwidth are important, such as gaming, real-time chat, or financial data streaming.\r\n\r\nServer-Sent Events, on the other hand, are designed for one-way communication from the server to the client, with a simple message-based API. SSE uses a text-based protocol that runs over a standard HTTP connection, which makes it easier to set up and use than WebSockets, especially in scenarios where firewalls or other security mechanisms block WebSockets connections. SSE connections are also designed to automatically reconnect if the connection is lost, making it more resilient than WebSockets in some scenarios. SSE is well suited for use cases where low latency is less important, such as sports updates, weather updates, or news feeds.\r\n\r\nWhen choosing between WebSockets and Server-Sent Events, the most important factors to consider are the type of data you want to transmit, the amount of data you want to transmit, and the desired level of real-time interaction between the client and server. If you need low latency, high bandwidth, two-way communication, and support for binary data, then WebSockets may be the better choice. If you need simple one-way communication and don't need real-time interaction, then Server-Sent Events may be the better choice.\r\n","target":1,"question":"Call child method from parent\n\nBoth WebSockets and Server-Sent Events are capable of pushing data to browsers.

{"question_id":18664074,"answer":"The error \"Peer authentication failed for user 'postgres'\" is typically caused by a misconfiguration in the PostgreSQL authentication settings. To resolve the issue, you need to make sure that the PostgreSQL server is configured to allow authentication for the user \"postgres\" and that the credentials in your Rails application's database.yml file are correct.\r\n\r\nFirst, check your pg_hba.conf file to make sure that it's configured to allow authentication for the \"postgres\" user. Look for a line that specifies the authentication method for the \"postgres\" user, and make sure it's set to \"md5\". The line should look something like this:\r\n\r\nsql\r\n\r\nlocal   all         postgres                 md5\r\n\r\nNext, check your database.yml file to make sure that the credentials for the \"postgres\" user are correct. Make sure that the \"username\" and \"password\" fields are set correctly for the \"production\" and \"development\" environments. The relevant sections of the file should look something like this:\r\n\r\nyaml\r\n\r\nproduction:\r\n  adapter: postgresql\r\n  encoding: unicode\r\n  database: myapp_production\r\n  username: postgres\r\n  password: mypassword\r\n\r\ndevelopment:\r\n  adapter: postgresql\r\n  encoding: unicode\r\n  database: myapp_development\r\n  username: postgres\r\n  password: mypassword\r\n\r\nIf the settings in your pg_hba.conf and database.yml files are correct, but you're still encountering the error, you may need to restart the PostgreSQL server to apply the changes. On most systems, you can do this by running the following command:\r\n\r\nsudo service postgresql restart\r\n\r\nIf the problem persists after restarting the server, try connecting to the PostgreSQL database using the psql client and specify the username and password on the command line.

{"question_id":2632677,"answer":"In Python, the \"++\" and \"--\" operators for incrementing and decrementing are not supported. Instead, you have to use the addition and subtraction operators to increment or decrement a variable:\r\n\r\nnumber = number + 1 # to increment\r\nnumber = number - 1 # to decrement\r\n\r\nThis syntax is the standard in Python and is more readable than the \"++\" and \"--\" operators.

{"question_id":572768,"answer":"The styling of the input type=\"file\" element is often limited by the browser's default styling, but you can make some changes by applying CSS styles to the element.

{"question_id":3492302,"answer":"One solution is to use the technique of Gaussian elimination to create a system of linear equations based on the sum and product of the numbers from 1 to N, with k unknowns representing the missing numbers. The system of linear equations can then be solved using matrix operations to find the missing numbers in time and space complexity defined in terms of k.\r\n\r\nFor Q2 (2 missing numbers), we can create a system of 2 linear equations based on the sum and product of the numbers from 1 to N:\r\n\r\n    Sum of all numbers = (N+1)(N\/2) - x - y\r\n    Product of all numbers = (N!)\/(N-k) = (N!)\/(N-2) = x * y\r\n    Where x and y are the missing numbers.\r\n\r\nFor Q3 (3 missing numbers), we can create a system of 3 linear equations based on the sum and product of the numbers from 1 to N:\r\n\r\n    Sum of all numbers = (N+1)(N\/2) - x - y - z\r\n    Product of all numbers = (N!)\/(N-k) = (N!)\/(N-3) = x * y * z\r\n    x + y + z = (N+1)(N\/2) - (sum of remaining numbers)\r\n\r\nFor Qk (k missing numbers), we can extend this approach by creating a system of k linear equations and solving for the k unknowns using matrix operations.\r\n\r\nNote that this technique requires a high level of mathematical proficiency and may not be practical for all interview situations. However, it provides a theoretical solution to the problem with the desired time and space complexity defined in terms of k.","target":1,"question":"How can I connect to Android with ADB over TCP?\n\nI had an interesting job interview experience a while back. The question started really easy:\n\nQ1: We have a bag containing numbers 1, 2, 3, \u2026, 100. Each number appears exactly once, so there are 100 numbers. Now one number is randomly picked out of the bag. Find the missing number.\n\nI've heard this interview question before, of course, so I very quickly answered along the lines of:\n\nA1: Well, the sum of the numbers 1 + 2 + 3 + \u2026 + N is (N+1)(N\/2) (see Wikipedia: sum of arithmetic series). For N = 100, the sum is 5050.\nThus, if all numbers are present in the bag, the sum will be exactly 5050. Since one number is missing, the sum will be less than this, and the difference is that number. So we can find that missing number in O(N) time and O(1) space.\n\nAt this point I thought I had done well, but all of a sudden the question took an unexpected turn:\n\nQ2: That is correct, but now how would you do this if TWO numbers are missing?\n\nI had never seen\/heard\/considered this variation before, so I panicked and couldn't answer the question. The interviewer insisted on knowing my thought process, so I mentioned that perhaps we can get more information by comparing against the expected product, or perhaps doing a second pass after having gathered some information from the first pass, etc, but I really was just shooting in the dark rather than actually having a clear path to the solution.\nThe interviewer did try to encourage me by saying that having a second equation is indeed one way to solve the problem. At this point I was kind of upset (for not knowing the answer before hand), and asked if this is a general (read: \"useful\") programming technique, or if it's just a trick\/gotcha answer.\nThe interviewer's answer surprised me: you can generalize the technique to find 3 missing numbers. In fact, you can generalize it to find k missing numbers.\n\nQk: If exactly k numbers are missing from the bag, how would you find it efficiently?\n\nThis was a few months ago, and I still couldn't figure out what this technique is.  Obviously there's a \u03a9(N) time lower bound since we must scan all the numbers at least once, but the interviewer insisted that the TIME and SPACE complexity of the solving technique (minus the O(N) time input scan) is defined in k not N.\nSo the question here is simple:\n\nHow would you solve Q2?\nHow would you solve Q3?\nHow would you solve Qk?\n\n\nClarifications\n\nGenerally there are N numbers from 1..N, not just 1..100.\nI'm not looking for the obvious set-based solution, e.g. using a bit set, encoding the presence\/absence each number by the value of a designated bit, therefore using O(N) bits in additional space. We can't afford any additional space proportional to N.\nI'm also not looking for the obvious sort-first approach. This and the set-based approach are worth mentioning in an interview (they are easy to implement, and depending on N, can be very practical). I'm looking for the Holy Grail solution (which may or may not be practical to implement, but has the desired asymptotic characteristics nevertheless).\n\nSo again, of course you must scan the input in O(N), but you can only capture small amount of information (defined in terms of k not N), and must then find the k missing numbers somehow.\n"}

{"question_id":3044580,"answer":"Multiprocessing and threading are both used in Python for parallel programming. Here are the key differences between them:\r\n\r\n    Global Interpreter Lock (GIL): The GIL is a limitation of the CPython implementation of Python, which only allows one thread to execute at a time, even on multi-core systems. Multiprocessing avoids the GIL by creating separate processes, which run in parallel and have their own independent Python interpreter instances. On the other hand, threading is affected by the GIL and cannot fully utilize the processing power of multi-core systems.\r\n\r\n    Resource Usage: Each process created by the multiprocessing module has its own memory space, which means that it can consume more memory compared to threads. However, because each process runs in its own memory space, it is more robust and less likely to crash due to memory errors.\r\n\r\n    Synchronization: Threads can communicate and share data through shared memory, making synchronization easier. In contrast, communication between processes in multiprocessing is more difficult, and typically involves inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms such as pipes or queues.\r\n\r\n    Blocking I\/O: Threading can block the entire process when it performs blocking I\/O operations, such as waiting for a network response. On the other hand, multiprocessing can still perform other tasks during blocking I\/O operations, as each process runs independently.\r\n\r\nIn general, multiprocessing is recommended for CPU-bound tasks and for tasks that are not affected by the GIL, while threading is recommended for I\/O-bound tasks and for tasks that can benefit from shared memory and easy synchronization.\r\n","target":1,"question":"How to display HTML in TextView?\n\nI am trying to understand the advantages of multiprocessing over threading.

{"question_id":4176328,"answer":"Sequence points\" in C++ refer to specific points in the evaluation of expressions where the order of execution of subexpressions is guaranteed to be fixed. This means that, at a sequence point, all side effects of previously evaluated subexpressions will have taken place, and all objects modified by those subexpressions will have their updated values.\r\n\r\nThe relation between undefined behavior and sequence points is that undefined behavior can result from violating the rules surrounding sequence points. For example, if you modify an object more than once between two sequence points, the behavior of the program is undefined. Another example is if you access an object after it has been destroyed.\r\n\r\nIt's best to avoid using funny and convoluted expressions like a[++i] = i; because they can easily result in undefined behavior. This is because such expressions can modify an object multiple times between sequence points, which is a violation of the rules surrounding sequence points. Using such expressions can make your code difficult to understand and maintain, and can lead to subtle bugs that are difficult to debug. Instead, it's recommended to use straightforward and easily understood expressions.","target":1,"question":"CSS 100% height with padding\/margin\n\nWhat are \"sequence points\"?\nWhat is the relation between undefined behaviour and sequence points?\nI often use funny and convoluted expressions like a[++i] = i;, to make myself feel better.

{"question_id":310974,"answer":"Tail Call Optimization (TCO) is a technique used in computer programming to eliminate the memory overhead of recursive function calls. When a function makes a call to itself, the call is said to be a tail call. In a language with TCO, if the last thing a function does before returning is to call another function, then the current function's stack frame can be eliminated and the call can be made in its place, saving memory and potentially avoiding a stack overflow.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of a tail call in JavaScript:\r\n\r\nsql\r\n\r\nfunction factorial(n, result = 1) {\r\n  if (n === 1) {\r\n    return result;\r\n  }\r\n  return factorial(n - 1, n * result);\r\n}\r\n\r\nIn this example, the factorial function is called with a new n and result on each iteration until n reaches 1, and each call returns the result of the next call, making it a tail call. JavaScript does not have TCO, so the stack will continue to grow with each call, potentially leading to a stack overflow.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, here's an example of a function that's not a tail call:\r\n\r\nscss\r\n\r\nfunction factorial(n) {\r\n  if (n === 1) {\r\n    return 1;\r\n  }\r\n  return n * factorial(n - 1);\r\n}\r\n\r\nIn this example, the call to factorial is not the last thing the function does before returning, so it's not a tail call and the stack will continue to grow with each call.\r\n\r\nLanguages like Scheme and Lua have TCO, allowing for efficient implementation of recursive algorithms. However, most mainstream programming languages like JavaScript, Python, and Java do not have TCO.\r\n","target":1,"question":"Using Python 3 in virtualenv\n\nVery simply, what is tail-call optimization?\n\nMore specifically, what are some small code snippets where it could be applied, and where not, with an explanation of why?\n"}

{"question_id":1301346,"answer":"In Python, a single leading underscore (e.g. _object) is used as a naming convention to indicate that the object is intended to be private.

For example, __object in a class named MyClass would become _MyClass__object.

{"question_id":14455293,"answer":"The async keyword before the method definition indicates that the method contains asynchronous operations, which can be executed concurrently with other operations.\r\n\r\nIn the code example, DoSomethingAsync() is an asynchronous method that returns a Task<int> and is executed with the await keyword. await is used to wait for an asynchronous operation to complete before continuing execution of the code.\r\n\r\nSystem.Threading.Thread.Sleep(5000) will cause the method to sleep for 5 seconds, simulating a long-duration operation, such as reading data from a network. When the method returns, it signals that the asynchronous operation is complete and the result can be retrieved.\r\n\r\nIn this example, the await keyword causes the button1_Click method to wait for the result of DoSomethingAsync before assigning the result to x. However, this does not mean that the program is blocked or stopped during the wait. Instead, the program is free to execute other code while DoSomethingAsync is running.\r\n\r\nIt's worth noting that while System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(5000) runs on the current thread, it is not guaranteed that the method is executed on a background thread.

{"question_id":3277367,"answer":"The behavior of super() in Python's multiple inheritance is determined by the method resolution order (MRO). In Python, the method resolution order is determined by the C3 linearization algorithm. The MRO determines the order in which superclasses are searched for a method resolution.\r\n\r\nWhen using super() in a class, it refers to the parent class in the method resolution order. For example, in the case of Third(First, Second), the MRO is [Third, First, Second, object]. When super().__init__() is called in the Third class, it first refers to the parent class in the MRO, which is First. If First doesn't have an implementation for __init__, the search continues to the next parent class, which is Second, and so on.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Third(First, Second), if you want to call the __init__ method of Second specifically, you can use Second.__init__(self) instead of super().__init__().","target":1,"question":"Can I write a CSS selector selecting elements NOT having a certain class or attribute?\n\nHow does super() work with multiple inheritance?

{"question_id":10407159,"answer":"To check the result in the main activity, you can use the onActivityResult() method. This method is called when the second activity finishes and returns a result.\r\n\r\nIn onActivityResult(), you can access the returned data by using the data parameter, which is an Intent that carries the result.

{"question_id":572547,"answer":"In C, the \"static\" keyword has a few different uses, each with its own meaning:\r\n\r\n    Static variables inside a function: When you declare a static variable inside a function, its value is preserved between function calls.

{"question_id":28459418,"answer":"The main difference between PUT and PATCH is the scope of the update to the resource. PUT is used to replace the entire resource identified by the URI, while PATCH is used to make a set of updates to a resource. PATCH updates are expressed as a set of differences from the current resource state, while PUT requires the entire resource state to be included in the request. In practice, PUT is used for resource creation or replacement when the full resource state is available and PATCH is used for updating a resource when only partial updates are needed. However, it is important to note that PUT is idempotent, meaning multiple identical PUT requests will result in the same resource state, while PATCH is not idempotent as multiple requests may result in different resource states.","target":1,"question":"git - remote add origin vs remote set-url origin\n\nFirst of all, some definitions:\nPUT is defined in Section 9.6 RFC 2616:\n\nThe PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers to an already existing resource, the enclosed entity SHOULD be considered as a modified version of the one residing on the origin server. If the Request-URI does not point to an existing resource, and that URI is capable of being defined as a new resource by the requesting user agent, the origin server can create the resource with that URI.\n\nPATCH is defined in RFC 5789:\n\nThe PATCH method requests that a set of changes described in the\nrequest entity be applied to the resource identified by the Request-\nURI.\n\nAlso according to RFC 2616 Section 9.1.2 PUT is Idempotent while PATCH is not.\nNow let us take a look at a real example. When I do POST to \/users with the data {username: 'skwee357', email: 'skwee357@domain.example'} and the server is capable of creating a resource, it will respond with 201 and resource location (lets assume \/users\/1) and any next call to GET \/users\/1 will return {id: 1, username: 'skwee357', email: 'skwee357@domain.example'}.\nNow let us say I want to modify my email. Email modification is considered \"a set of changes\" and therefore I should PATCH \/users\/1 with \"patch document\". In my case it would be the JSON document: {email: 'skwee357@newdomain.example'}. The server then returns 200 (assuming permission are ok). This brings me to first question:\n\nPATCH is NOT idempotent. It said so in RFC 2616 and RFC 5789. However if I issue the same PATCH request (with my new email), I will get the same resource state (with my email being modified to the requested value). Why is PATCH not then idempotent?\n\nPATCH is a relatively new verb (RFC introduced in March 2010), and it comes to solve the problem of \"patching\" or modifying a set of fields. Before PATCH was introduced, everybody used PUT to update resources. But after PATCH was introduced, it leaves me confused about what PUT is used for. And this brings me to my second (and the main) question:\n\nWhat is the real difference between PUT and PATCH? I have read somewhere that PUT might be used to replace entire entity under specific resource, so one should send the full entity (instead of set of attributes as with PATCH). What is the real practical usage for such case? When would you like to replace \/ overwrite an entity at a specific resource URI and why is such an operation not considered updating \/ patching the entity? The only practical use case I see for PUT is issuing a PUT on a collection, i.e. \/users to replace the entire collection. Issuing PUT on a specific entity makes no sense after PATCH was introduced. Am I wrong?\n\n"}

{"question_id":1179758,"answer":"In SQL Server, a stored procedure is a pre-compiled, reusable piece of code that can accept input parameters and perform one or more database operations. Stored procedures are typically used to perform complex, data-centric tasks that are executed frequently, such as data validation, data manipulation, and data retrieval.\r\n\r\nA function, on the other hand, is a subroutine that can be used in a SELECT statement.

{"question_id":8554043,"answer":"A clearfix is a CSS technique used to clear the float property of an element, so that its child elements do not wrap around the floated element but instead appear below it. This is particularly useful when creating multi-column layouts, as it ensures that the columns have equal heights and no overlapping content.\r\n\r\nAn example of a layout with a clearfix could be a three-column layout, where each column has a float property set to left. Without a clearfix, the parent container may not contain the floated columns, and the footer would appear alongside the floated columns. However, by using a clearfix on the parent container, the parent container will properly contain the floated columns and the footer will appear below them.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of a clearfix:\r\n\r\ncss\r\n\r\n.clearfix::after {\r\n  content: \"\";\r\n  clear: both;\r\n  display: table;\r\n}\r\nThis is typically added to the CSS of the parent container, which in this case is .clearfix.

{"question_id":5082452,"answer":"All three methods are used for string formatting in Python, but each has its own advantages and disadvantages.\r\n\r\n\"Hello %s\" % name (Python < 2.6): This method uses string formatting with % operator and is the oldest way to format strings in Python. It is simple to use, but its syntax can be confusing, especially when formatting multiple values.\r\n\r\n\"Hello {}\".format(name) (Python 2.6+): This method uses str.format() and provides a more readable and flexible way to format strings compared to % operator. Named arguments can also be used, making it easier to keep track of the format specification.\r\n\r\nf\"Hello {name}\" (Python 3.6+): This method uses f-string literals and is the newest way to format strings in Python. It provides the same flexibility as str.format() with the added benefit of being more readable and having a performance advantage in certain cases.\r\n\r\nIn terms of performance, f-strings are generally faster than the other two methods, but the difference is negligible for small strings. The real difference in performance comes from the number of times the string is formatted. If a string is formatted once, all three methods have similar performance. However, if a string is formatted multiple times, f-strings will be faster.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it depends on the individual's preference and the context in which the string is being formatted.

{"question_id":371328,"answer":"The preferred method for overriding the 'GetHashCode' is 'return this.FooId.GetHashCode();'.\r\n\r\nIt is important to override the 'GetHashCode' method when you override the 'Equals' method because the 'GetHashCode' is used as a key in hash-based collections, such as dictionaries and hash sets. When two objects are equal, they should also have the same hash code. If the hash codes are different for equal objects, the hash-based collections might not work correctly and you might not be able to retrieve the objects properly.\r\n\r\nThus, overriding the 'GetHashCode' is important because it ensures that the hash-based collections work correctly when you use the 'Equals' method to compare objects.","target":1,"question":"Create an empty list with certain size in Python\n\nGiven the following class\n\npublic class Foo\n{\n    public int FooId { get; set; }\n    public string FooName { get; set; }\n\n    public override bool Equals(object obj)\n    {\n        Foo fooItem = obj as Foo;\n\n        if (fooItem == null) \n        {\n           return false;\n        }\n\n        return fooItem.FooId == this.FooId;\n    }\n\n    public override int GetHashCode()\n    {\n        \/\/ Which is preferred?\n\n        return base.GetHashCode();\n\n        \/\/return this.FooId.GetHashCode();\n    }\n}\n\n\nI have overridden the Equals method because Foo represent a row for the Foos table.

{"question_id":881515,"answer":"In JavaScript, a namespace can be created using an object literal or by assigning an object to a property of another object.

{"question_id":5210535,"answer":"There are several ways to pass data between view controllers in iOS:\r\n\r\n1- Properties: You can define properties in the destination view controller that will store the data. Then, before presenting the destination view controller, you can set those properties to the data you want to pass. Finally, you can access those properties in the destination view controller to get the passed data.\r\n\r\n2- Delegate pattern: You can define a delegate protocol in the destination view controller and have the source view controller implement that protocol. You can then pass the source view controller as the delegate to the destination view controller when it is presented. In the destination view controller, you can call delegate methods to pass the data back to the source view controller.\r\n\r\n3- Singleton: You can create a singleton class that stores the data. You can then access the singleton from both view controllers to get or set the data.\r\n\r\n4- Notification center: You can use the NSNotificationCenter to post a notification that contains the data. The source view controller can post the notification and the destination view controller can observe the notification to receive the data.\r\n\r\nOut of these options, using properties or the delegate pattern is recommended in most cases.\r\n\r\nAs for creating a data model, it's a good idea to encapsulate your data in model objects and store these objects in a persistent store like Core Data.

{"question_id":1077412,"answer":"An idempotent operation is an operation that has the property of having the same result no matter how many times it is executed.

This is important because it allows HTTP clients to retry failed requests without causing any unexpected changes to the system.\r\n\r\nAnother example is database transactions.

{"question_id":92396,"answer":"The reason you cannot declare variables within a case statement in many programming languages is because of the way the switch statement is executed. The switch statement selects a block of code to execute based on the value of the switch expression.

This would make it difficult for the compiler to determine if the variable has been declared elsewhere in the code and would potentially lead to naming conflicts and other problems.

{"question_id":1532461,"answer":"The second implementation using the StringBuilder is generally preferred, especially for larger number of string concatenations.

After digging deeper I realized that one of the bottlenecks was something as simple as sorting arrays. The relevant part is here:\n\nlet n = 1000000\nvar x =  [Int](repeating: 0, count: n)\nfor i in 0..<n {\n    x[i] = random()\n}\n\/\/ start clock here\nlet y = sort(x)\n\/\/ stop clock here\n\n\nIn C++, a similar operation takes 0.06s on my computer.\n\nIn Python, it takes 0.6s (no tricks, just y = sorted(x) for a list of integers).\n\nIn Swift it takes 6s if I compile it with the following command:\n\nxcrun swift -O3 -sdk `xcrun --show-sdk-path --sdk macosx`\n\n\nAnd it takes as much as 88s if I compile it with the following command:\n\nxcrun swift -O0 -sdk `xcrun --show-sdk-path --sdk macosx`\n\n\nTimings in Xcode with \"Release\" vs. \"Debug\" builds are similar.\n\nWhat is wrong here? I could understand some performance loss in comparison with C++, but not a 10-fold slowdown in comparison with pure Python.\n\n\n\nEdit: weather noticed that changing -O3 to -Ofast makes this code run almost as fast as the C++ version! However, -Ofast changes the semantics of the language a lot \u2014 in my testing, it disabled the checks for integer overflows and array indexing overflows. For example, with -Ofast the following Swift code runs silently without crashing (and prints out some garbage):\n\nlet n = 10000000\nprint(n*n*n*n*n)\nlet x =  [Int](repeating: 10, count: n)\nprint(x[n])\n\n\nSo -Ofast is not what we want; the whole point of Swift is that we have the safety nets in place. Of course, the safety nets have some impact on the performance, but they should not make the programs 100 times slower. Remember that Java already checks for array bounds, and in typical cases, the slowdown is by a factor much less than 2. And in Clang and GCC we have got -ftrapv for checking (signed) integer overflows, and it is not that slow, either.\n\nHence the question: how can we get reasonable performance in Swift without losing the safety nets?\n\n\n\nEdit 2: I did some more benchmarking, with very simple loops along the lines of\n\nfor i in 0..<n {\n    x[i] = x[i] ^ 12345678\n}\n\n\n(Here the xor operation is there just so that I can more easily find the relevant loop in the assembly code. I tried to pick an operation that is easy to spot but also \"harmless\" in the sense that it should not require any checks related to integer overflows.)\n\nAgain, there was a huge difference in the performance between -O3 and -Ofast. So I had a look at the assembly code:\n\n\nWith -Ofast I get pretty much what I would expect. The relevant part is a loop with 5 machine language instructions.\nWith -O3 I get something that was beyond my wildest imagination. The inner loop spans 88 lines of assembly code. I did not try to understand all of it, but the most suspicious parts are 13 invocations of \"callq _swift_retain\" and another 13 invocations of \"callq _swift_release\". That is, 26 subroutine calls in the inner loop!\n\n\n\n\nEdit 3: In comments, Ferruccio asked for benchmarks that are fair in the sense that they do not rely on built-in functions (e.g. sort). I think the following program is a fairly good example:\n\nlet n = 10000\nvar x = [Int](repeating: 1, count: n)\nfor i in 0..<n {\n    for j in 0..<n {\n        x[i] = x[j]\n    }\n}\n\n\nThere is no arithmetic, so we do not need to worry about integer overflows. The only thing that we do is just lots of array references. And the results are here\u2014Swift -O3 loses by a factor almost 500 in comparison with -Ofast:\n\n\nC++ -O3: 0.05 s\nC++ -O0: 0.4 s\nJava: 0.2 s\nPython with PyPy: 0.5 s\nPython: 12 s\nSwift -Ofast: 0.05 s\nSwift -O3: 23 s\nSwift -O0: 443 s\n\n\n(If you are concerned that the compiler might optimize out the pointless loops entirely, you can change it to e.g. x[i] ^= x[j], and add a print statement that outputs x[0]. This does not change anything; the timings will be very similar.)\n\nAnd yes, here the Python implementation was a stupid pure Python implementation with a list of ints and nested for loops. It should be much slower than unoptimized Swift. Something seems to be seriously broken with Swift and array indexing.\n\n\n\nEdit 4: These issues (as well as some other performance issues) seems to have been fixed in Xcode 6 beta 5.\n\nFor sorting, I now have the following timings:\n\n\nclang++ -O3: 0.06 s\nswiftc -Ofast: 0.1 s\nswiftc -O: 0.1 s\nswiftc: 4 s\n\n\nFor nested loops:\n\n\nclang++ -O3: 0.06 s\nswiftc -Ofast: 0.3 s\nswiftc -O: 0.4 s\nswiftc: 540 s\n\n\nIt seems that there is no reason anymore to use the unsafe -Ofast (a.k.a. -Ounchecked); plain -O produces equally good code.\n"}

{"question_id":24853,"answer":"++i and i++ are both increment operator in C language, they both increment the value of i by 1. However, the difference between them is the order in which they increment the value of i and return the value.\r\n\r\n++i is called the pre-increment operator, it increments the value of i before it is used.\r\ni++ is called the post-increment operator, it increments the value of i after it has been used.\r\nIn the context of a for loop, both ++i and i++ can be used as the incrementation expression. However, the difference between them can sometimes matter in terms of the loop behavior.

{"question_id":11032015,"answer":"The time complexity of an algorithm is a way to describe how the running time of the algorithm grows with the size of the input. It gives an idea of how much more time an algorithm will take when the size of the input increases.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, you'll use Big O notation to describe the time complexity of an algorithm. Big O notation gives an upper bound on the growth rate of the running time of an algorithm. For example, an algorithm with a time complexity of O(N) means that its running time will increase linearly with the size of the input. An algorithm with a time complexity of O(N^2) means that its running time will increase quadratically with the size of the input.\r\n\r\nTo calculate the time complexity of an algorithm, you need to consider the operations performed by the algorithm and how they are impacted by the size of the input. Here are the steps to calculate the time complexity:\r\n\r\n    Identify the operations performed by the algorithm.\r\n    Determine how the number of operations performed depends on the size of the input.\r\n    Express the number of operations as a function of the size of the input, using big O notation.\r\n\r\nLet's consider the example you mentioned:\r\n\r\ncss\r\n\r\nfor (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\r\n    Console.Write('Hello, World!!');\r\n}\r\n\r\nHere, the operation performed is Console.Write('Hello, World!!'), which will be executed N times.

{"question_id":19622198,"answer":"Your understanding of the script is mostly correct.\r\n\r\nThe line set -e is used to specify that the script should exit immediately if a command returns a non-zero exit status.

{"question_id":39494058,"answer":"An Observable is a stream of values that can emit multiple values over time. It can be subscribed to and it can emit values to its subscribers asynchronously.\r\n\r\nA BehaviorSubject, on the other hand, is a specific type of Subject in RxJS.

{"question_id":3220660,"answer":"Cookies and local storage are both web storage options that can be used to store data on the client side. However, there are some differences between them:\r\n\r\nPros of local storage:\r\n\r\n    Large storage capacity: Local storage has a larger storage capacity compared to cookies (typically 5-10 MB).\r\n    Persistence: Local storage data persists even after the browser is closed.\r\n    Faster access: Accessing data in local storage is faster compared to cookies as the data is stored in a structured manner and doesn't need to be sent with every HTTP request.\r\n\r\nCons of local storage:\r\n\r\n    Insecurity: Local storage data is not automatically encrypted and can be easily accessed by attackers if the user's device is compromised.\r\n    No expiration date: Unlike cookies, local storage data does not have an expiration date and will persist until explicitly deleted by the user or the website.\r\n\r\nPros of cookies:\r\n\r\n    Expiration date: Cookies have an expiration date, which allows you to control the lifetime of the stored data.\r\n    Secure storage: Cookies can be encrypted and transmitted over secure HTTPS connections, making them more secure compared to local storage.\r\n\r\nCons of cookies:\r\n\r\n    Limited size: Cookies have a limited size (typically 4 KB), which makes them unsuitable for storing large amounts of data.\r\n    Slower access: Cookies are sent with every HTTP request, which increases the amount of data transmitted and slows down the website's performance.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, local storage is generally a better choice if you need to store large amounts of data, but it lacks the security and expiration date features of cookies. Cookies are more secure, but have limited storage capacity and can slow down website performance. If you need to move all cookies into local storage, it's recommended to make sure that sensitive information is properly encrypted and secured before being stored in local storage.","target":1,"question":"Service vs IntentService in the Android platform\n\nI want to reduce load times on my websites by moving all cookies into local storage since they seem to have the same functionality.

{"question_id":301371,"answer":"In C#, the Dictionary class is preferred over the Hashtable class for several reasons:\r\n\r\n    Strongly Typed: The Dictionary class is strongly typed, meaning that it allows you to store only values of a specific type. Hashtable, on the other hand, is not strongly typed, so you can store any type of object in it.\r\n\r\n    Performance: Dictionaries are faster than hashtables because they are implemented as a generic data structure and use a hash table internally for searching. Hashtables, on the other hand, use a linked list to handle collisions.\r\n\r\n    Linq support: Dictionary provides support for LINQ (Language Integrated Query), which makes it easier to filter and manipulate data.\r\n\r\n    Null keys: Dictionary class allows you to use null as a key, while Hashtable does not.\r\n\r\n    Simplified Syntax: The syntax of the Dictionary class is much simpler and more readable compared to the Hashtable class.\r\n\r\n    Garbage Collection: Dictionaries are reference types, which means that they are managed by the garbage collector. Hashtables, on the other hand, are not managed by the garbage collector and need to be explicitly released when no longer in use.\r\n\r\n    Non-thread safe: The Dictionary class is not thread-safe by default, while the Hashtable class is.

{"question_id":931092,"answer":"The easiest way to reverse a string in Python is to use slicing. You can create a new string that is a slice of the original string in reverse order, like this:\r\n\r\nruby\r\n\r\ndef reverse_string(string):\r\n    return string[::-1]\r\nThis method is very efficient as it does not require any data structure conversions and only creates a new string, which takes up O(n) space where n is the length of the original string.

{"question_id":6269765,"answer":"The b character in front of a string literal in Python indicates a \"bytes literal\".\r\n\r\nIt is used to specify a sequence of bytes and is usually used for binary data, such as encoding and decoding. Bytes literals are useful for working with binary data such as image or audio files. They are also useful for working with protocols that use ASCII or other 8-bit encoded characters.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\npython\r\n\r\n>>> b'Hello World'\r\nb'Hello World'\r\n\r\nIn Python 3, the b character is not necessary to use when creating byte strings, because in Python 3, the default string type is Unicode, whereas in Python 2, it's ASCII.\r\n\r\nIn addition to b and u symbols, there is also an f symbol in front of string literals to create \"f-strings\" in Python 3.3 and later. F-strings are a new feature in Python and allow for string interpolation in a more readable and efficient way.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\npython\r\n\r\n>>> name = \"Alice\"\r\n>>> f\"Hello, {name}\"\r\n'Hello, Alice'","target":1,"question":"What does the \"+\" (plus sign) CSS selector mean?\n\nApparently, the following is the valid syntax:\nb'The string'\n\nI would like to know:\n\nWhat does this b character in front of the string mean?\nWhat are the effects of using it?\nWhat are appropriate situations to use it?\n\nI found a related question right here on SO, but that question is about PHP though, and it states the b is used to indicate the string is binary, as opposed to Unicode, which was needed for code to be compatible from version of PHP < 6, when migrating to PHP 6. I don't think this applies to Python.\nI did find this documentation on the Python site about using a u character in the same syntax to specify a string as Unicode.

{"question_id":5901378,"answer":"A Maven Snapshot is a version of a project that is under active development and is not yet considered to be a release version. A snapshot version is typically marked with a version identifier that includes the string \"SNAPSHOT\", e.g. 1.0-SNAPSHOT.\r\n\r\nSnapshots are used to capture the state of a project at a particular point in time, so that other developers or projects can depend on a version of the project that is known to work. Snapshots are typically built and published to a repository (such as Nexus or Artifactory) at regular intervals, so that other developers can get the latest version of the project.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of using snapshots is to provide a way for developers to collaborate on a project and integrate changes from each other in a timely manner.

{"question_id":1139160,"answer":"The choice between CROSS APPLY and INNER JOIN usually comes down to personal preference and readability. In general, INNER JOIN is more commonly used, but CROSS APPLY can be more efficient in certain situations.\r\n\r\nCROSS APPLY can be more efficient than INNER JOIN when the right-side query returns a small number of rows for each row on the left side. This is because CROSS APPLY is able to make use of the spool operator to cache intermediate results, avoiding the need to re-execute the right-side query for each row.

{"question_id":21692193,"answer":"Inheriting from List<T> is generally discouraged for a few reasons:\r\n\r\n    List is a concrete implementation of a collection, and inheriting from it might make it difficult to change the underlying implementation later. This is especially true if you are exposing the class as a public API, as you won't be able to change the implementation without breaking existing code.\r\n\r\n    List has specific optimizations for performance, and if you inherit from it and add custom functionality, you might unintentionally break these optimizations, leading to sub-optimal performance.\r\n\r\n    The principle of inheritance is best used to extend the behavior of a base class, not just to reuse its implementation. In other words, inheritance should express an \"is-a\" relationship, rather than just a \"has-a\" relationship.\r\n\r\nInstead of inheriting from List<T>, a better solution is to use composition, where you have a private List<T> field and expose the required functionality through custom methods and properties. This allows you to encapsulate the List<T> implementation and change it if needed.\r\n\r\nIf you need a custom collection, Microsoft recommends using the Collection<T> class as the base class, which provides a more appropriate base for custom collections than List<T>. If you find that the Collection<T> class is too bare-bones for your needs, you can add custom functionality on top of it. This gives you the benefit of having a well-designed, flexible base class, without the risks associated with inheriting from List<T>.\r\n","target":1,"question":"Xcode building for iOS Simulator, but linking in an object file built for iOS, for architecture 'arm64'\n\nWhen planning out my programs, I often start with a chain of thought like so:\n\n\n  A football team is just a list of football players.

For example, the running total of scores this season, the current budget, the uniform colors, a string representing the name of the team, etc..\n\nSo then I think:\n\n\n  Okay, a football team is just like a list of players, but additionally, it has a name (a string) and a running total of scores (an int). .NET does not provide a class for storing football teams, so I will make my own class. The most similar and relevant existing structure is List<FootballPlayer>, so I will inherit from it:\n\nclass FootballTeam : List<FootballPlayer> \n{ \n    public string TeamName; \n    public int RunningTotal \n}\n\n\n\nBut it turns out that a guideline says you shouldn't inherit from List<T>. I'm thoroughly confused by this guideline in two respects.\n\nWhy not?\n\nApparently List is somehow optimized for performance. How so? What performance problems will I cause if I extend List? What exactly will break?\n\nAnother reason I've seen is that List is provided by Microsoft, and I have no control over it, so I cannot change it later, after exposing a \"public API\". But I struggle to understand this. What is a public API and why should I care? If my current project does not and is not likely to ever have this public API, can I safely ignore this guideline? If I do inherit from List and it turns out I need a public API, what difficulties will I have?\n\nWhy does it even matter? A list is a list. What could possibly change? What could I possibly want to change?\n\nAnd lastly, if Microsoft did not want me to inherit from List, why didn't they make the class sealed?\n\nWhat else am I supposed to use?\n\nApparently, for custom collections, Microsoft has provided a Collection class which should be extended instead of List. But this class is very bare, and does not have many useful things, such as AddRange, for instance. jvitor83's answer provides a performance rationale for that particular method, but how is a slow AddRange not better than no AddRange?\n\nInheriting from Collection is way more work than inheriting from List, and I see no benefit. Surely Microsoft wouldn't tell me to do extra work for no reason, so I can't help feeling like I am somehow misunderstanding something, and inheriting Collection is actually not the right solution for my problem.\n\nI've seen suggestions such as implementing IList. Just no. This is dozens of lines of boilerplate code which gains me nothing.\n\nLastly, some suggest wrapping the List in something: \n\nclass FootballTeam \n{ \n    public List<FootballPlayer> Players; \n}\n\n\nThere are two problems with this:\n\n\nIt makes my code needlessly verbose. I must now call my_team.Players.Count instead of just my_team.Count. Thankfully, with C# I can define indexers to make indexing transparent, and forward all the methods of the internal List... But that's a lot of code! What do I get for all that work?\nIt just plain doesn't make any sense. A football team doesn't \"have\" a list of players. It is the list of players. You don't say \"John McFootballer has joined SomeTeam's players\". You say \"John has joined SomeTeam\". You don't add a letter to \"a string's characters\", you add a letter to a string. You don't add a book to a library's books, you add a book to a library.\n\n\nI realize that what happens \"under the hood\" can be said to be \"adding X to Y's internal list\", but this seems like a very counter-intuitive way of thinking about the world.\n\nMy question (summarized)\n\nWhat is the correct C# way of representing a data structure, which, \"logically\" (that is to say, \"to the human mind\") is just a list of things with a few bells and whistles?\n\nIs inheriting from List<T> always unacceptable? When is it acceptable? Why\/why not? What must a programmer consider, when deciding whether to inherit from List<T> or not?\n"}

{"question_id":4795385,"answer":"Bcrypt is a password hashing function that uses the Blowfish symmetric-key block cipher algorithm. Bcrypt was specifically designed for password hashing and provides a number of benefits over other password hashing algorithms, including being slow and difficult to attack with brute-force methods.\r\n\r\nTo use bcrypt in PHP, you can use the password_hash() function, which is included in PHP 5.5 and later.

{"question_id":22146094,"answer":"Yes, that's partially correct. In C++, using pointers to objects can offer some performance benefits, such as better control over memory allocation and direct access to the memory address of the object. However, it also increases the complexity and potential for bugs in your code, such as the need to manage memory allocation and deallocation manually and being mindful of null pointers.\r\n\r\nIt's worth noting that using pointers is generally not required and it depends on the specific use case and design of your program. In many cases, using objects directly is a simpler and more straightforward approach. It's important to carefully weigh the trade-offs and use the appropriate approach for each situation.","target":1,"question":"How to deal with floating point number precision in JavaScript?\n\nI'm coming from a Java background and have started working with objects in C++.

{"question_id":2391679,"answer":"Virtual functions in C++ allow you to specify a base class function that can be redefined in derived classes. The main purpose of virtual functions is to enable dynamic dispatch, which is the ability of the program to call the correct overridden function at runtime, based on the actual type of the object, rather than the type of the reference or pointer to the base class. This is important for maintaining correct behavior in scenarios where you have a collection of objects of different types, all of which are referred to by a reference or pointer to the base class type. In such cases, without virtual functions, the base class implementation would always be called, even if an object of a derived type is actually being referred to.","target":1,"question":"How do you roll back (reset) a Git repository to a particular commit?\n\nI'm learning C++ and I'm just getting into virtual functions.\nFrom what I've read (in the book and online), virtual functions are functions in the base class that you can override in derived classes.\nBut earlier in the book, when learning about basic inheritance, I was able to override base functions in derived classes without using virtual.\nSo what am I missing here?

{"question_id":30626030,"answer":"React components only rerender when their state or props change. To force a component to rerender without changing the state, you can call this.forceUpdate(). However, it's usually better to change the state or props in a way that triggers a rerender, rather than relying on forceUpdate. This is because React uses the state and props to determine if a rerender is needed, so if the component's state or props aren't changed, React won't know that the component needs to rerender.","target":1,"question":"How to drop a PostgreSQL database if there are active connections to it?\n\nI have an external (to the component), observable object that I want to listen for changes on. When the object is updated it emits change events, and then I want to rerender the component when any change is detected.\n\nWith a top-level React.render this has been possible, but within a component it doesn't work (which makes some sense since the render method just returns an object).\n\nHere's a code example:\n\nexport default class MyComponent extends React.Component {\n\n  handleButtonClick() {\n    this.render();\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        {Math.random()}\n        <button onClick={this.handleButtonClick.bind(this)}>\n          Click me\n        <\/button>\n      <\/div>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\n\nClicking the button internally calls this.render(), but that's not what actually causes the rendering to happen (you can see this in action because the text created by {Math.random()} doesn't change). However, if I simply call this.setState() instead of this.render(), it works fine.\n\nSo I guess my question is: do React components need to have state in order to rerender? Is there a way to force the component to update on demand without changing the state?\n"}

{"question_id":1866794,"answer":"When naming classes, it's best to choose descriptive, specific names that accurately reflect the purpose of the class. Avoid generic terms like \"Manager\" or \"Handler,\" as they don't provide enough information about what the class does. Instead, consider using names that describe the class's responsibilities, such as \"UserRecordsClerk\" or \"UserShepherd.\" It can also be helpful to have a list of commonly used prefixes and suffixes, such as \"Coordinator,\" \"Builder,\" and \"Controller,\" to use as a reference when naming classes. However, don't get too caught up in the naming process - it's important to have descriptive names, but they don't have to be perfect. If you can't think of a good name after 10 minutes, move on and come back to it later.","target":1,"question":"git cherry-pick says \"...38c74d is a merge but no -m option was given\"\n\nA long time ago I have read an article (I believe a blog entry) which put me on the \"right\" track on naming objects: Be very very scrupulous about naming things in your program.\n\nFor example if my application was (as a typical business app) handling users, companies and addresses I'd have a User, a Company and an Address domain class - and probably somewhere a UserManager, a CompanyManager and an AddressManager would pop up that handles those things.\n\nSo can you tell what those UserManager, CompanyManager and AddressManager do? No, because Manager is a very very generic term that fits to anything you can do with your domain objects.\n\nThe article I read recommended using very specific names. If it was a C++ application and the UserManager's job was allocating and freeing users from the heap it would not manage the users but guard their birth and death. Hmm, maybe we could call this a UserShepherd.\n\nOr maybe the UserManager's job is to examine each User object's data and sign the data cryptographically. Then we'd have a UserRecordsClerk.\n\nNow that this idea stuck with me I try to apply it. And find this simple idea amazingly hard.\n\nI can describe what the classes do and (as long as I don't slip into quick & dirty coding) the classes I write do exactly one thing. What I miss to go from that description to the names is a kind of catalogue of names, a vocabulary that maps the concepts to names.\n\nUltimately I'd like to have something like a pattern catalogue in my mind (frequently design patterns easily provide the object names, e.g. a factory)\n\n\nFactory - Creates other objects (naming taken from the design pattern)\nShepherd - A shepherd handles the lifetime of objects, their creation and shutdown\nSynchronizer - Copies data between two or more objects (or object hierarchies)\nNanny - Helps objects reach \"usable\" state after creation - for example by wiring to other objects\netc etc.\n\n\nSo, how do you handle that issue? Do you have a fixed vocabulary, do you invent new names on the fly or do you consider naming things not-so-important or wrong?\n\nP.S.: I'm also interested in links to articles and blogs discussing the issue. As a start, here is the original article that got me thinking about it: Naming Java Classes without a 'Manager'\n\n\n\nUpdate: Summary of answers\n\nHere's a little summary of what I learned from this question in the meantime.\n\n\nTry not to create new metaphors (Nanny)\nHave a look at what other frameworks do\n\n\nFurther articles\/books on this topic:\n\n\nWhat names do you find yourself prepending\/appending to classes regularly? \nWhat\u2019s the best approach to naming classes?\nBook: Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software (Hardcover)\nBook: Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture (Hardcover)\nBook: Implementation Patterns (Paperback)\n\n\nAnd a current list of name prefixes\/suffixes I collected (subjectively!) from the answers:\n\n\nCoordinator\nBuilder\nWriter\nReader\nHandler\nContainer\nProtocol\nTarget\nConverter\nController\nView\nFactory\nEntity\nBucket\n\n\nAnd a good tip for the road:\n\n\n  Don't get naming paralysis.

{"question_id":1495407,"answer":"Yes, you can use CSS3 rules to maintain the aspect ratio of a div while changing its width\/height. One way to achieve this is by using the \"padding-bottom\" or \"padding-top\" property with a percentage value. The percentage value represents the aspect ratio you want to maintain. For example, if you want a 4:3 aspect ratio, you can set the padding-bottom property to 75%.\r\n\r\nHere's an example:\r\n\r\ncss\r\n\r\n.responsive-box {\r\n  position: relative;\r\n  width: 100%;\r\n  padding-bottom: 75%; \/* 4:3 aspect ratio *\/\r\n}\r\n\r\n.responsive-box::before {\r\n  content: \"\";\r\n  display: block;\r\n  padding-top: 100%;\r\n}\r\n\r\nThis works because padding is calculated as a percentage of the parent element's width.

{"question_id":4361553,"answer":"The access modifiers public, private, and protected in object-oriented programming languages such as PHP, Java, or C++ determine the visibility and accessibility of class variables (also known as fields or properties) and methods (functions).\r\n\r\n    public: A member declared as public can be accessed from anywhere within the code.

{"question_id":1497958,"answer":"Vim registers are storage locations where you can save and retrieve text. They can be used to store yanked text, deleted text, and more. Some common uses of Vim registers include:\r\n\r\nYanking text: To yank text into a register, use the \"y\" command followed by a motion command, such as \"yw\" to yank a word or \"yy\" to yank a line. The text is stored in the default register, which can be pasted using the \"p\" command.\r\n\r\nDeleting text: To delete text into a register, use the \"d\" command followed by a motion command, such as \"dw\" to delete a word or \"dd\" to delete a line. The deleted text is stored in the default register.\r\n\r\nNamed registers: Vim supports named registers, which are used to store text in specific locations for later use. Named registers can be specified using double quotes, for example, \"a to yank text into register \"a\". To paste text from a named register, use \"Ctrl-R\" followed by the name of the register, for example, \"Ctrl-R a\".\r\n\r\nAppend to a register: To append text to a register, use the \"A\" command followed by the register name, for example, \"A a\" to append text to register \"a\".\r\n\r\nMacros: Vim supports macros, which are sequences of commands that can be saved and reused later. Macros can be recorded into a register using the \"qa\" command, followed by the desired commands, and ended with the \"q\" command. The macro can then be executed by typing \"@\" followed by the register name, for example, \"@a\".\r\n\r\nUsing the unnamed register: The unnamed register is a special register that holds the text of the most recent yank or delete operation. You can paste from the unnamed register using the \"p\" command.\r\n\r\nThese are just a few examples of how Vim registers can be used.

{"question_id":5009324,"answer":"Node.js is typically used for creating server-side applications and Nginx is a popular web server used for serving static content and proxying requests to other servers.\r\n\r\nWhen using Node.js and Nginx together, a common setup is to have Nginx handle static file requests and proxy requests for dynamic content to a Node.js application. This allows Nginx to handle the high performance needs of serving static files and frees up the Node.js server to handle the dynamic content.\r\n\r\nRegarding the two concepts, it depends on the use case. If you have multiple websites with different requirements, it's better to create a separate Node.js server for each website. This allows you to customize the server for each website, as well as provide isolation between the different applications. However, if all the websites have similar requirements, a single Node.js server can handle all requests.\r\n\r\nIn either case, it's recommended to have a reverse proxy like Nginx in front of the Node.js server to handle load balancing, SSL termination, and other performance-related tasks.","target":1,"question":"Are strongly-typed functions as parameters possible in TypeScript?\n\nI've set up Node.js and Nginx on my server.

Promises are used to handle a single event and are easy to work with, as they can be chained with other promises.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of using a Promise in Angular:\r\n\r\njavascript\r\n\r\nlet promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\r\n  setTimeout(() => resolve(\"Hello from Promise!\"), 1000);\r\n});\r\n\r\npromise.then(message => console.log(message));\r\nObservables, on the other hand, are a pattern for dealing with multiple events over time. Observables are used to handle a stream of values that arrive over time, and can be observed and manipulated. An observable can emit multiple values over its lifetime and can be used to handle complex asynchronous events.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of using an Observable in Angular:\r\n\r\njavascript\r\n\r\nimport { interval } from 'rxjs';\r\n\r\nlet observable = interval(1000);\r\n\r\nobservable.subscribe(value => console.log(`Hello from Observable! ${value}`));\r\nIn general, you can use Promises when you need to handle a single event, and you can use Observables when you need to handle multiple events over time. Promises are better for simple use cases, while Observables are more powerful for complex use cases.","target":1,"question":"Check\/Uncheck checkbox with JavaScript\n\nWhat is the difference between Promise and Observable in Angular?\n\nAn example on each would be helpful in understanding both the cases.

{"question_id":1028250,"answer":"Reactive programming is a programming paradigm concerned with the propagation of change. A system that implements reactive programming has components that can react to changes in the inputs and produce new outputs. In other words, the system automatically updates its behavior in response to changes.\r\n\r\nFunctional reactive programming (FRP) is a specific type of reactive programming that builds on functional programming concepts, such as immutability and pure functions. It allows developers to express complex dynamic interactions between inputs and outputs in a declarative and composable manner, without relying on stateful variables and manual mutation.\r\n\r\nIn practice, reactive programming can be used to build applications with real-time or streaming data sources, such as games, financial trading systems, or streaming services. By treating values as streams of data, reactive programming makes it possible to handle large amounts of data with high performance, scalability, and reliability.\r\n\r\nCompared to non-reactive programming, reactive programming shifts the focus from managing state updates to defining the relationships between inputs and outputs. Instead of using imperative code to write explicit updates, reactive programming uses declarative code to describe how inputs affect outputs, and lets the system handle the updates automatically.","target":1,"question":"What is the difference between GitHub and gist?\n\nI've read the Wikipedia article on reactive programming.

The other way around, in small dogs it often fails to find a 5th toe, which I suspect is being caused by the 2x2 area being too large.\nAfter trying the current solution on all my measurements I came to the staggering conclusion that for nearly all my small dogs it didn't find a 5th toe and that in over 50% of the impacts for the large dogs it would find more!\nSo clearly I need to change it. My own guess was changing the size of the neighborhood to something smaller for small dogs and larger for large dogs. But generate_binary_structure wouldn't let me change the size of the array.\nTherefore, I'm hoping that anyone else has a better suggestion for locating the toes, perhaps having the toe area scale with the paw size?\n"}

{"question_id":10168686,"answer":"To improve the algorithm for Coca-Cola can recognition, consider the following steps:\r\n\r\nOptimize the runtime: The Generalized Hough Transform is a computationally expensive method. One way to reduce the runtime is to use pyramid representation to reduce the size of the image and then apply the Hough Transform on the smaller images first. This will give you an approximate location of the can and you can then apply the Hough Transform on a small region of interest around the approximate location, which will give you the final result.\r\n\r\nHandle the presence of bottles: To handle the presence of bottles, you can use object detection algorithms such as the Viola-Jones algorithm or Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) to detect the presence of both cans and bottles in the image. Then, use a classifier to distinguish between the two. This can help you reduce the false positives and improve the accuracy of the detection.\r\n\r\nImprove the recognition of fuzzy images: One way to handle fuzzy images is to use a different edge detection algorithm such as the Structured Edge Detection algorithm or the Deep Edge Detection algorithm which are designed to handle such cases.\r\n\r\nImprove orientation invariance: To improve orientation invariance, you can use an additional dimension in the Generalized Hough Transform that can represent the orientation of the object. Alternatively, you can use object detection algorithms that are invariant to orientation such as the RCNN family of algorithms or the YOLOv5 algorithm.\r\n\r\nNote: OpenCV library provides the implementations of these algorithms and you can use them to improve your current implementation.","target":1,"question":"Volatile vs. Interlocked vs. lock\n\nOne of the most interesting projects I've worked on in the past couple of years was a project about image processing. The goal was to develop a system to be able to recognize Coca-Cola 'cans' (note that I'm stressing the word 'cans', you'll see why in a minute). You can see a sample below, with the can recognized in the green rectangle with scale and rotation.\n\n\n\nSome constraints on the project:\n\n\nThe background could be very noisy.\nThe can could have any scale or rotation or even orientation (within reasonable limits).\nThe image could have some degree of fuzziness (contours might not be entirely straight).\nThere could be Coca-Cola bottles in the image, and the algorithm should only detect the can!\nThe brightness of the image could vary a lot (so you can't rely \"too much\" on color detection).\nThe can could be partly hidden on the sides or the middle and possibly partly hidden behind a bottle.\nThere could be no can at all in the image, in which case you had to find nothing and write a message saying so.\n\n\nSo you could end up with tricky things like this (which in this case had my algorithm totally fail):\n\n\n\nI did this project a while ago, and had a lot of fun doing it, and I had a decent implementation. Here are some details about my implementation:\n\nLanguage: Done in C++ using OpenCV library.\n\nPre-processing: For the image pre-processing, i.e. transforming the image into a more raw form to give to the algorithm, I used 2 methods:\n\n\nChanging color domain from RGB to HSV and filtering based on \"red\" hue, saturation above a certain threshold to avoid orange-like colors, and filtering of low value to avoid dark tones. The end result was a binary black and white image, where all white pixels would represent the pixels that match this threshold. Obviously there is still a lot of crap in the image, but this reduces the number of dimensions you have to work with.\n  \nNoise filtering using median filtering (taking the median pixel value of all neighbors and replace the pixel by this value) to reduce noise.\nUsing Canny Edge Detection Filter to get the contours of all items after 2 precedent steps.\n\n\n\nAlgorithm: The algorithm itself I chose for this task was taken from this awesome book on feature extraction and called Generalized Hough Transform (pretty different from the regular Hough Transform). It basically says a few things:\n\n\nYou can describe an object in space without knowing its analytical equation (which is the case here).\nIt is resistant to image deformations such as scaling and rotation, as it will basically test your image for every combination of scale factor and rotation factor.\nIt uses a base model (a template) that the algorithm will \"learn\".\nEach pixel remaining in the contour image will vote for another pixel which will supposedly be the center (in terms of gravity) of your object, based on what it learned from the model.\n\n\nIn the end, you end up with a heat map of the votes, for example here all the pixels of the contour of the can will vote for its gravitational center, so you'll have a lot of votes in the same pixel corresponding to the center, and will see a peak in the heat map as below:\n\n\n\nOnce you have that, a simple threshold-based heuristic can give you the location of the center pixel, from which you can derive the scale and rotation and then plot your little rectangle around it (final scale and rotation factor will obviously be relative to your original template). In theory at least...\n\nResults: Now, while this approach worked in the basic cases, it was severely lacking in some areas:\n\n\nIt is extremely slow! I'm not stressing this enough. Almost a full day was needed to process the 30 test images, obviously because I had a very high scaling factor for rotation and translation, since some of the cans were very small.\nIt was completely lost when bottles were in the image, and for some reason almost always found the bottle instead of the can (perhaps because bottles were bigger, thus had more pixels, thus more votes)\nFuzzy images were also no good, since the votes ended up in pixel at random locations around the center, thus ending with a very noisy heat map.\nIn-variance in translation and rotation was achieved, but not in orientation, meaning that a can that was not directly facing the camera objective wasn't recognized.\n\n\nCan you help me improve my specific algorithm, using exclusively OpenCV features, to resolve the four specific issues mentioned?\n\nI hope some people will also learn something out of it as well, after all I think not only people who ask questions should learn. :)\n"}

{"question_id":34510,"answer":"A race condition occurs when two or more threads access shared data concurrently and the final result depends on the timing of how the threads are scheduled.\r\n\r\nDetection: Race conditions can be difficult to detect as they may only occur under specific conditions and are often hard to reproduce. One way to detect them is to use specialized tools such as a debugger or race detector. Another approach is to add logging statements or insert sleep statements to help force the race condition to occur.\r\n\r\nHandling: There are several ways to handle race conditions including using locks to synchronize access to shared data, using atomic operations, or using the concept of lock-free programming.\r\n\r\nPrevention: To prevent race conditions from occurring, you can use synchronization primitives such as locks, semaphores, or atomic operations to ensure that shared data is accessed in a controlled and synchronized manner.

{"question_id":755685,"answer":"Yes, your observation is correct. You should use static readonly for public constant values, and const for internal, protected, or private constant values.\r\n\r\nWhether to use static readonly fields or properties depends on the specific needs of your system and your personal preferences. static readonly fields are appropriate if you want to store constant values that don't change at runtime. Properties, on the other hand, allow you to add logic to your constant values, such as computation or validation, and are appropriate if you need that level of control over the constant values.\r\n\r\nIn general, it's a good practice to use properties for constant values that need to be computed, and static readonly fields for constant values that are simple and don't need any additional logic.","target":1,"question":"Delete forked repo from GitHub\n\nI've read around about const and static readonly fields.

{"question_id":32461229,"answer":"Redux and Facebook Flux are both state management libraries for React applications. Here are some differences between the two:\r\n\r\nRedux emphasizes functional programming principles, while Facebook Flux is more of an event-driven architecture.\r\nRedux has a simpler and more predictable state management structure, where the state is stored in a single store, compared to Flux's multiple stores.\r\nRedux makes it easier to implement features such as hot reloading, undo\/redo functionality, and server rendering, compared to Flux.\r\nRedux has a larger developer community and a wider range of tools and libraries available, such as middlewares and dev tools for debugging.\r\nRedux's architecture is easier to test, as it has a clear structure for state management and actions.\r\nSo, in summary, you should use Redux over Facebook Flux if you want a simpler, more predictable, and easier-to-test state management library, and if you prefer functional programming principles.

{"question_id":761194,"answer":"An abstract class with only abstract methods would be different from an interface in that it still has the possibility of inheritance and can have implementations of non-abstract methods. An interface can only contain abstract members (methods, properties, etc.), while an abstract class can contain both abstract and non-abstract members.\r\n\r\nIt's not possible to have a public variable inside an interface because interfaces can only declare abstract members and do not have any implementation. The main purpose of an interface is to define a contract that must be followed by any class that implements it, without specifying how the methods are to be implemented. An abstract class, on the other hand, can provide some implementation and define a common base class for its subclasses.\r\n\r\nThe decision between using an interface or an abstract class usually depends on whether you want to define a contract or provide a common implementation.

If I am missing a major point please let me know.\nInterface:\nEvery single Method declared in an Interface will have to be implemented in the subclass.\nOnly Events, Delegates, Properties (C#) and Methods can exist in an Interface. A class can implement multiple Interfaces.\nAbstract Class:\nOnly Abstract methods have to be implemented by the subclass. An Abstract class can have normal methods with implementations. An Abstract class can also have class variables besides Events, Delegates, Properties and Methods. A class can implement one abstract class only due to the non-existence of Multi-inheritance in C#.\n\nAfter all that, the interviewer came up with the question \"What if you had an Abstract class with only abstract methods?

{"question_id":14132789,"answer":"The \"Attempted relative import in non-package\" error message is raised in Python when you try to use a relative import statement in a script that is not part of a package. In Python, a package is a directory that contains one or more Python modules (files with .py extension) and a special file called init.py.\r\n\r\nThe init.py file tells Python that this directory should be treated as a package and makes the modules inside it accessible from other modules and scripts. If the script you are trying to import from does not belong to a package, then Python cannot determine the relative position of the modules, and the error is raised.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this error, you can either:\r\n\r\nMake the script a part of a package by creating an init.py file in the same directory as the script, or\r\nUse an absolute import statement instead of a relative import statement. An absolute import statement uses the full path to the module you want to import, starting from the root of your project.\r\nFor example, if you want to import the 'moduleA' from the package structure you mentioned above, you can use an absolute import statement:\r\n\r\npython\r\n\r\nfrom package.moduleA import spam\r\nOr, if you want to use a relative import statement, you can run your script as a module by using the -m flag and specify the full package name:\r\n\r\njava\r\n\r\npython -m package.moduleA","target":1,"question":"Regular expression to stop at first match\n\nI've been here:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.python.org\/dev\/peps\/pep-0328\/\nhttp:\/\/docs.python.org\/2\/tutorial\/modules.html#packages\nPython packages: relative imports\npython relative import example code does not work\nRelative imports in python 2.5\nRelative imports in Python\nPython: Disabling relative import\n\nand plenty of URLs that I did not copy, some on SO, some on other sites, back when I thought I'd have the solution quickly.\nThe forever-recurring question is this: how do I solve this \"Attempted relative import in non-package\" message?\nImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package\n\nI built an exact replica of the package on pep-0328:\npackage\/\n    __init__.py\n    subpackage1\/\n        __init__.py\n        moduleX.py\n        moduleY.py\n    subpackage2\/\n        __init__.py\n        moduleZ.py\n    moduleA.py\n\nThe imports were done from the console.\nI did make functions named spam and eggs in their appropriate modules.

{"question_id":17330160,"answer":"The property decorator is a built-in function in Python that allows a user to define a method as a getter, setter, or deleter for a class property.

{"question_id":3413470,"answer":"std::move is a C++ Standard Library function that is used to indicate that an object t should be treated as an rvalue (i.e. a value that can be moved from), even if it is an lvalue (i.e. a value that cannot be moved from). It is typically used to transfer ownership of an object to a new location without making a copy.\r\n\r\nThe function returns an rvalue reference to the argument passed to it, allowing the object to be moved to a new location without copying. This can be useful for performance optimization, especially in cases where the object being moved is large or expensive to copy.\r\n\r\nA good use case for std::move is with the return value of a function, where the object being returned should be moved to the caller instead of copied. It can also be used in the implementation of move constructors and move assignment operators.\r\n\r\nHere is a simple example showing how std::move can be used in a function that returns an object:\r\n\r\ncpp\r\n\r\n#include <utility>\r\n\r\nclass MyClass {\r\n  public:\r\n    MyClass() {}\r\n    MyClass(const MyClass &) { \/* copy constructor *\/ }\r\n    MyClass(MyClass &&) { \/* move constructor *\/ }\r\n};\r\n\r\nMyClass getObject() {\r\n  MyClass obj;\r\n  return std::move(obj);\r\n}\r\n\r\nint main() {\r\n  MyClass obj = getObject();\r\n  return 0;\r\n}\r\nIn this example, the getObject function returns a temporary object that would normally be copied to the obj variable in main. However, by using std::move, the object is moved to obj instead, which is more efficient as it avoids a copy.\r\n\r\nIt's important to note that using std::move can result in undefined behavior if the moved-from object is used after it has been moved. It is also not guaranteed to be more efficient than copying, so it should be used with caution and only when necessary.","target":1,"question":"What's the shebang\/hashbang (#!) in Facebook and new Twitter URLs for?\n\n\nWhat is it?\nWhat does it do?\nWhen should it be used?\n\n\nGood links are appreciated.\n"}

{"question_id":8898925,"answer":"The reason for reusing the same variable in a foreach loop is for performance reasons. When a new variable is declared for each iteration, it increases the memory allocation and can negatively impact the performance of the program.

To avoid the modified closure issue, one can use a temporary variable within the foreach loop.","target":1,"question":"When to use single quotes, double quotes, and backticks in MySQL\n\nWhen using lambda expressions or anonymous methods in C#, we have to be wary of the access to modified closure pitfall. For example:\n\nforeach (var s in strings)\n{\n   query = query.Where(i => i.Prop == s); \/\/ access to modified closure\n   ...\n}\n\n\nDue to the modified closure, the above code will cause all of the Where clauses on the query to be based on the final value of s.\n\nAs explained here, this happens because the s variable declared in foreach loop above is translated like this in the compiler:\n\nstring s;\nwhile (enumerator.MoveNext())\n{\n   s = enumerator.Current;\n   ...\n}\n\n\ninstead of like this:\n\nwhile (enumerator.MoveNext())\n{\n   string s;\n   s = enumerator.Current;\n   ...\n}\n\n\nAs pointed out here, there are no performance advantages to declaring a variable outside the loop, and under normal circumstances the only reason I can think of for doing this is if you plan to use the variable outside the scope of the loop:\n\nstring s;\nwhile (enumerator.MoveNext())\n{\n   s = enumerator.Current;\n   ...\n}\nvar finalString = s;\n\n\nHowever variables defined in a foreach loop cannot be used outside the loop:\n\nforeach(string s in strings)\n{\n}\nvar finalString = s; \/\/ won't work: you're outside the scope.\n\n\nSo the compiler declares the variable in a way that makes it highly prone to an error that is often difficult to find and debug, while producing no perceivable benefits.\n\nIs there something you can do with foreach loops this way that you couldn't if they were compiled with an inner-scoped variable, or is this just an arbitrary choice that was made before anonymous methods and lambda expressions were available or common, and which hasn't been revised since then?\n"}

{"question_id":15112584,"answer":"$scope.$watch and $scope.$apply are two important features in AngularJS that are used to monitor changes in the scope and update the DOM accordingly.\r\n\r\n$scope.$watch is used to observe changes in a scope variable and take some action when the value changes. For example, you could use $scope.$watch to update the UI whenever the value of a certain variable changes. Here's an example of how to use $scope.$watch:\r\n\r\nphp\r\n\r\n$scope.$watch('variableName', function (newValue, oldValue) {\r\n  \/\/ Take some action when the value changes\r\n});\r\n$scope.$apply is used to apply changes to the scope and trigger a digest cycle. A digest cycle is an AngularJS process that checks all the bound expressions in the scope to see if they have changed and updates the UI if necessary. If you make changes to the scope outside of AngularJS, you need to call $scope.$apply to trigger a digest cycle and update the UI. Here's an example of how to use $scope.$apply:\r\n\r\nphp\r\n\r\n$scope.$apply(function () {\r\n  \/\/ Make changes to the scope\r\n});\r\nThe connection point between $scope.$watch and $scope.$apply is that $scope.$watch is used to monitor changes in the scope and take action when the value changes, while $scope.$apply is used to apply changes to the scope and trigger a digest cycle to update the UI.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, $scope.$watch and $scope.$apply are important features in AngularJS that are used to monitor changes in the scope and update the UI accordingly. Use $scope.$watch to observe changes in a scope variable and take some action when the value changes, and use $scope.$apply to apply changes to the scope and trigger a digest cycle to update the UI.","target":1,"question":"How to check if a string is a valid JSON string?\n\nI don't understand how to use $scope.$watch and $scope.$apply.

{"question_id":18641899,"answer":"Bower and npm are both package managers for front-end and back-end JavaScript packages, respectively.

{"question_id":185899,"answer":"A symbolic (or soft) link is a special type of file that acts as a reference to another file or directory.

{"question_id":2970608,"answer":"Named tuples are a subclass of tuples. Like tuples, they are immutable and ordered, but unlike tuples, they have named fields accessible by dot (.) operator instead of indexing. Named tuples are more readable and self-documenting compared to tuples, and can also be used as alternatives to dictionaries where the keys of dictionaries are often hardcoded.\r\n\r\nYou can create a named tuple using the following syntax:\r\n\r\npython\r\n\r\nfrom collections import namedtuple\r\nPoint = namedtuple('Point', ['x', 'y'])\r\np = Point(x=11, y=22)\r\n\r\nIn terms of use, named tuples are used whenever you need to give a name to each element in a tuple, to make the code more readable. Named tuples are also used as a replacement for dictionaries, when the keys of the dictionaries are known beforehand.\r\n\r\nWhen to use named tuples instead of tuples or vice versa depends on the situation. Normal tuples are faster than named tuples and can be used when you don't need named elements.

{"question_id":39476,"answer":"The \"yield\" keyword in C# is used in Iterator blocks to return values one at a time.

Of course there is a matter of debate as to whether it aught to be too easy to scale this pattern...\nWhat is the point of the _sealed attribute\nCan't call methods of the same name on base classes using super() because they will recurse. This means you can't customize __new__ and can't subclass a class that needs you to call up to __init__.\n\n\nMethod 5: a module\na module file singleton.py\nPros\n\nSimple is better than complex\n\nCons\n\nNot lazily instantiated\n\n"}

{"question_id":5963669,"answer":"event.stopPropagation and event.preventDefault are both methods used to handle events in JavaScript, but they have different purposes:\r\n\r\nevent.preventDefault() is used to prevent the default behavior of an event. For example, if you have a form and you don't want it to submit when the submit button is clicked, you can call preventDefault() on the submit event to prevent the form from being submitted.\r\n\r\nevent.stopPropagation() is used to stop the event from propagating (or \"bubbling\") up the DOM tree. In other words, it stops the event from triggering any parent elements.\r\n\r\nBoth methods are widely supported by modern browsers and are still used in modern web development. In practice, it's good to check for both methods if you're handling events manually, but you should use them according to the specific needs of your use case. If you just want to prevent the default behavior of an event, preventDefault() is sufficient. If you also want to stop the event from propagating up the DOM tree, you can call stopPropagation() in addition to preventDefault().\r\n\r\nRegarding return false: This is an old way of handling events, and it's not recommended for use with modern event handling techniques, such as addEventListener.

{"question_id":457927,"answer":"The \"correct\" Git workflow depends on the specific needs and preferences of the team or individual using it. However, in general, the recommended workflow for using Git with a team is to create a feature branch for each new feature, rebase the feature branch from the main branch (usually \"master\") to incorporate the latest changes, and then merge the feature branch back into the main branch once the feature is complete. Some teams prefer to use squash merges to keep a clean commit history on the main branch, while others prefer to keep a full commit history of the feature branch. The choice between merge and rebase comes down to personal preference and the specific use case, with rebase being better suited for fast-moving branches, while merge is better for preserving the history of a branch. Pushing a feature branch to the remote repository is a good way to backup work in progress, but it's also possible to work locally and push only when the feature is complete.","target":1,"question":"How do I update Node.js?\n\nI've been using Git now for a couple of months on a project with one other developer. I have several years of experience with SVN, so I guess I bring a lot of baggage to the relationship.\n\nI have heard that Git is excellent for branching and merging, and so far, I just don't see it. Sure, branching is dead simple, but when I try to merge, everything goes all to hell. Now, I'm used to that from SVN, but it seems to me that I just traded one sub-par versioning system for another.\n\nMy partner tells me that my problems stem from my desire to merge willy-nilly, and that I should be using rebase instead of merge in many situations. For example, here's the workflow that he's laid down:\n\nclone the remote repository\ngit checkout -b my_new_feature\n..work and commit some stuff\ngit rebase master\n..work and commit some stuff\ngit rebase master\n..finish the feature\ngit checkout master\ngit merge my_new_feature\n\n\nEssentially, create a feature branch, ALWAYS rebase from master to the branch, and merge from the branch back to master. Important to note is that the branch always stays local.\n\nHere is the workflow that I started with\n\nclone remote repository\ncreate my_new_feature branch on remote repository\ngit checkout -b --track my_new_feature origin\/my_new_feature\n..work, commit, push to origin\/my_new_feature\ngit merge master (to get some changes that my partner added)\n..work, commit, push to origin\/my_new_feature\ngit merge master\n..finish my_new_feature, push to origin\/my_new_feature\ngit checkout master\ngit merge my_new_feature\ndelete remote branch\ndelete local branch\n\n\nThere are two essential differences (I think): I use merge always instead of rebasing, and I push my feature branch (and my feature branch commits) to the remote repository.\n\nMy reasoning for the remote branch is that I want my work backed up as I'm working. Our repository is automatically backed up and can be restored if something goes wrong. My laptop is not, or not as thoroughly. Therefore, I hate to have code on my laptop that's not mirrored somewhere else.\n\nMy reasoning for the merge instead of rebase is that merge seems to be standard and rebase seems to be an advanced feature. My gut feeling is that what I'm trying to do is not an advanced setup, so rebase should be unnecessary. I've even perused the new Pragmatic Programming book on Git, and they cover merge extensively and barely mention rebase.\n\nAnyway, I was following my workflow on a recent branch, and when I tried to merge it back to master, it all went to hell. There were tons of conflicts with things that should have not mattered. The conflicts just made no sense to me. It took me a day to sort everything out, and eventually culminated in a forced push to the remote master, since my local master has all conflicts resolved, but the remote one still wasn't happy.\n\nWhat is the \"correct\" workflow for something like this? Git is supposed to make branching and merging super-easy, and I'm just not seeing it.\n\nUpdate 2011-04-15\n\nThis seems to be a very popular question, so I thought I'd update with my two years experience since I first asked.\n\nIt turns out that the original workflow is correct, at least in our case. In other words, this is what we do and it works:\n\nclone the remote repository\ngit checkout -b my_new_feature\n..work and commit some stuff\ngit rebase master\n..work and commit some stuff\ngit rebase master\n..finish the feature, commit\ngit rebase master\ngit checkout master\ngit merge my_new_feature\n\n\nIn fact, our workflow is a little different, as we tend to do squash merges instead of raw merges. (Note: This is controversial, see below.) This allows us to turn our entire feature branch into a single commit on master. Then we delete our feature branch. This allows us to logically structure our commits on master, even if they're a little messy on our branches. So, this is what we do:\n\nclone the remote repository\ngit checkout -b my_new_feature\n..work and commit some stuff\ngit rebase master\n..work and commit some stuff\ngit rebase master\n..finish the feature, commit\ngit rebase master\ngit checkout master\ngit merge --squash my_new_feature\ngit commit -m \"added my_new_feature\"\ngit branch -D my_new_feature\n\n\nSquash Merge Controversy - As several commenters have pointed out, the squash merge will throw away all history on your feature branch. As the name implies, it squashes all the commits down into a single one. For small features, this makes sense as it condenses it down into a single package. For larger features, it's probably not a great idea, especially if your individual commits are already atomic. It really comes down to personal preference.\n\nGithub and Bitbucket (others?) Pull Requests - In case you're wondering how merge\/rebase relates to Pull Requests, I recommend following all the above steps up until you're ready to merge back to master. Instead of manually merging with git, you just accept the PR. Note that this will not do a squash merge (at least not by default), but non-squash, non-fast-forward is the accepted merge convention in the Pull Request community (as far as I know). Specifically, it works like this:\n\nclone the remote repository\ngit checkout -b my_new_feature\n..work and commit some stuff\ngit rebase master\n..work and commit some stuff\ngit rebase master\n..finish the feature, commit\ngit rebase master\ngit push # May need to force push\n...submit PR, wait for a review, make any changes requested for the PR\ngit rebase master\ngit push # Will probably need to force push (-f), due to previous rebases from master\n...accept the PR, most likely also deleting the feature branch in the process\ngit checkout master\ngit branch -d my_new_feature\ngit remote prune origin\n\n\nI've come to love Git and never want to go back to SVN. If you're struggling, just stick with it and eventually you'll see the light at the end of the tunnel.\n"}

{"question_id":7627098,"answer":"A lambda expression in C++11 is a small anonymous function that can be used to pass functionality as an argument to algorithms or as a callable object. They were introduced in C++11 to provide a more concise and readable syntax for writing small, inline functions that can be used as arguments to higher-order functions or as callable objects.\r\n\r\nLambdas capture variables from their surrounding scope and can be used to write functions that operate on those variables, making them useful for writing small, one-off functions that can be passed to algorithms or used as callable objects.\r\n\r\nExamples of using lambdas:\r\n\r\nSorting a vector of integers in ascending order:\r\ncpp\r\n\r\nvector<int> v = {5, 2, 7, 3};\r\nsort(v.begin(), v.end(), [](int a, int b) {\r\n    return a < b;\r\n});\r\nFiltering a list of strings based on a condition:\r\nvbnet\r\n\r\nlist<string> lst = {\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"};\r\nlist<string> result;\r\nfor_each(lst.begin(), lst.end(), [&result](const string& s) {\r\n    if (s.length() > 5) {\r\n        result.push_back(s);\r\n    }\r\n});\r\nLambdas were not possible prior to C++11 and their introduction made it easier to write code that was more concise and readable, especially when dealing with functional programming concepts.","target":1,"question":"What is the best way to remove accents (normalize) in a Python unicode string?\n\nWhat is a lambda expression in C++11?

{"question_id":533631,"answer":"A mixin is a specific type of multiple inheritance that allows a class to inherit behavior from multiple classes (mixins) in a modular way, without having to create a full inheritance hierarchy.\r\n\r\nA mixin is essentially a way to reuse code and behavior without having to create a full-fledged class hierarchy. The idea is that a mixin can be used in conjunction with other classes to provide additional behavior or attributes.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to multiple inheritance, where a class can inherit from multiple parent classes, mixins are designed to be combined with other classes, rather than being used on their own. This allows the mixin to provide a specific set of behavior or attributes that can be used in multiple contexts.\r\n\r\nMixins can be seen as an alternative to composition, where a class composes or aggregates objects of other classes to provide a desired behavior or attribute. However, mixins provide a cleaner way of adding behavior, since they don't require creating instances of other classes.\r\n\r\nSo, to summarize, the main difference between mixins and multiple inheritance is that mixins are designed to provide specific reusable behavior, while multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from multiple classes in a more general sense.","target":1,"question":"Wildcards in jQuery selectors\n\nIn Programming Python, Mark Lutz mentions the term mixin.

{"question_id":4716503,"answer":"In Java, you can read plain text data from a file using the following methods:\r\n\r\nFileReader and BufferedReader classes: This method reads text data one character at a time using the FileReader class, and then buffers the data for efficient reading using the BufferedReader class.\r\nInputStreamReader and BufferedReader classes: This method reads binary data from an InputStream and converts it to characters using the InputStreamReader class, and then buffers the data for efficient reading using the BufferedReader class.\r\nScanner class: This is a convenient method for reading data from various sources including files, input streams, and strings. The Scanner class provides methods for parsing various data types such as integers, doubles, and strings.\r\nIn general, the choice between these methods depends on the requirements of your application and the specific use case.

{"question_id":1764263,"answer":"In Vim, the <leader> key is a user-defined key used to trigger various custom mapping or commands. It's commonly set to \\ by default but can be changed to any key or combination of keys. The purpose of the <leader> key is to provide a way to extend Vim's functionality and create custom keybindings that don't clash with built-in Vim commands.\r\n\r\nFor example, you could use the <leader> key to map a key combination to run a command that you use frequently. Here's an example in a .vimrc file:\r\n\r\nruby\r\n\r\nnmap <leader>w :w<CR>\r\nThis maps the <leader>w key combination to the :w command, which writes the current file to disk.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the <leader> key is a powerful feature in Vim that allows you to extend its functionality and create custom keybindings for your personal workflow.","target":1,"question":"Java: convert List<String> to a join()d String\n\nI see <leader> in many .vimrc files, and I am wondering what does it mean? \n\nWhat is it used for? \n\nJust a general overview of the purpose and usage would be great.\n"}

{"question_id":12179271,"answer":"@classmethod and @staticmethod are decorators in Python that are used to define methods that belong to a class rather than an instance of the class.\r\n\r\n    @classmethod takes a class as its first argument, rather than an instance, and is used for methods that operate on the class itself rather than on instances of the class. This is useful for methods that need to access or modify class-level state, such as class variables.\r\n\r\n    @staticmethod is used for methods that do not access the class or instance in any way, but operate solely on the arguments passed to them. They do not have access to the class or instance, and can be thought of as functions that are scoped to the class namespace.\r\n\r\nIn general, you should use @classmethod when you need to access or modify class-level state, and @staticmethod when you have a method that is logically connected to a class but does not access the class or instance in any way.\r\n\r\nHere is a simple example to demonstrate the usage of @classmethod and @staticmethod:\r\n\r\npython\r\n\r\nclass Rectangle:\r\n    count = 0\r\n\r\n    def __init__(self, width, height):\r\n        self.width = width\r\n        self.height = height\r\n        Rectangle.count += 1\r\n\r\n    def __repr__(self):\r\n        return f\"Rectangle(width={self.width}, height={self.height})\"\r\n\r\n    @classmethod\r\n    def square(cls, side_length):\r\n        return cls(side_length, side_length)\r\n\r\n    @staticmethod\r\n    def is_valid_dimensions(width, height):\r\n        return all(isinstance(d, int) and d > 0 for d in (width, height))","target":1,"question":"Bash ignoring error for a particular command\n\nWhat do @classmethod and @staticmethod mean in Python, and how are they different?

{"question_id":1050222,"answer":"Concurrency and parallelism are related but distinct concepts in computing.\r\n\r\nConcurrency refers to the ability of a system to execute multiple tasks simultaneously, where each task appears to run independently and in parallel, but in reality they are executed by sharing the same CPU time. This is accomplished by quickly switching between tasks, giving the illusion of parallel execution.\r\n\r\nParallelism, on the other hand, refers to the actual simultaneous execution of multiple tasks, where each task is executed on a separate CPU core. This results in true parallel execution, with each task making progress at the same time.\r\n\r\nIn other words, concurrency is about dealing with a lot of things at once, parallelism is about doing a lot of things at once.","target":1,"question":"Divide a number by 3 without using *, \/, +, -, % operators\n\nWhat is the difference between concurrency and parallelism?\n"}

{"question_id":1504717,"answer":"The reason is that Python uses a optimization technique called interning for string literals, which means that two string literals with the same value are stored in the same memory location. This is why s1 is s2 returns True in the example above.\r\n\r\nHowever, this interning optimization is only applied to string literals, not to string objects created dynamically with string operations or through user input. When you create two separate string objects with the same value, they are stored in different memory locations, even though they have the same value. In this case, s1 is s2 would return False.\r\n\r\nThe == operator compares the values of two objects, while the is operator compares the identity of two objects. So, even though s1 and s2 have the same value, they are not the same object in memory, so s1 is s2 returns False. But, because their values are equal, s1 == s2 returns True.","target":1,"question":"How to paste yanked text into the Vim command line\n\nTwo string variables are set to the same value. s1 == s2 always returns True, but s1 is s2 sometimes returns False.\nIf I open my Python interpreter and do the same is comparison, it succeeds:\n>>> s1 = 'text'\n>>> s2 = 'text'\n>>> s1 is s2\nTrue\n\nWhy is this?\n"}

{"question_id":890128,"answer":"Lambdas in Python are small, anonymous functions that can be used for short, single-use functions.
