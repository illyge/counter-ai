0,11227809,"Why is processing a sorted array faster than processing an unsorted array?

Here is a piece of C++ code that shows some very peculiar behavior.
For some reason, sorting the data (before the timed region) miraculously makes the primary loop almost six times faster:
#include <algorithm>
#include <ctime>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    // Generate data
    const unsigned arraySize = 32768;
    int data[arraySize];

    for (unsigned c = 0; c < arraySize; ++c)
        data[c] = std::rand() % 256;

    // !!! With this, the next loop runs faster.
    std::sort(data, data + arraySize);

    // Test
    clock_t start = clock();
    long long sum = 0;
    for (unsigned i = 0; i < 100000; ++i)
    {
        for (unsigned c = 0; c < arraySize; ++c)
        {   // Primary loop.
            if (data[c] >= 128)
                sum += data[c];
        }
    }

    double elapsedTime = static_cast<double>(clock()-start) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;

    std::cout << elapsedTime << '\n';
    std::cout << ""sum = "" << sum << '\n';
}


Without std::sort(data, data + arraySize);, the code runs in 11.54 seconds.
With the sorted data, the code runs in 1.93 seconds.

(Sorting itself takes more time than this one pass over the array, so it's not actually worth doing if we needed to calculate this for an unknown array.)

Initially, I thought this might be just a language or compiler anomaly, so I tried Java:
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Random;

public class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // Generate data
        int arraySize = 32768;
        int data[] = new int[arraySize];

        Random rnd = new Random(0);
        for (int c = 0; c < arraySize; ++c)
            data[c] = rnd.nextInt() % 256;

        // !!! With this, the next loop runs faster
        Arrays.sort(data);

        // Test
        long start = System.nanoTime();
        long sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 100000; ++i)
        {
            for (int c = 0; c < arraySize; ++c)
            {   // Primary loop.
                if (data[c] >= 128)
                    sum += data[c];
            }
        }

        System.out.println((System.nanoTime() - start) / 1000000000.0);
        System.out.println(""sum = "" + sum);
    }
}

With a similar but less extreme result.

My first thought was that sorting brings the data into the cache, but that's silly because the array was just generated.

What is going on?
Why is processing a sorted array faster than processing an unsorted array?

The code is summing up some independent terms, so the order should not matter.

According to RFC 2616, § 9.6, PUT is used to create or replace a resource:

The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied Request-URI.

Yesterday I was pairing the socks from the clean laundry and figured out the way I was doing it is not very efficient. I was doing a naive search — picking one sock and ""iterating"" the pile in order to find its pair. This requires iterating over n/2 * n/4 = n2/8 socks on average.

As a computer scientist I was thinking what I could do? Sorting (according to size/color/...) of course came to mind to achieve an O(NlogN) solution.

Hashing or other not-in-place solutions are not an option, because I am not able to duplicate my socks (though it could be nice if I could).

So, the question is basically:

Given a pile of n pairs of socks, containing 2n elements (assume each sock has exactly one matching pair), what is the best way to pair them up efficiently with up to logarithmic extra space? (I believe I can remember that amount of info if needed.)

I will appreciate an answer that addresses the following aspects:


A general theoretical solution for a huge number of socks.
The actual number of socks is not that large, I don't believe my spouse and I have more than 30 pairs. (And it is fairly easy to distinguish between my socks and hers; can this be used as well?)

Generally, please close other questions as a duplicate of that question when an explanation is sought, and this question when someone simply needs to know the global keyword.

165,1711631,"Improve INSERT-per-second performance of SQLite

Optimizing SQLite is tricky. Bulk-insert performance of a C application can vary from 85 inserts per second to over 96,000 inserts per second!
Background: We are using SQLite as part of a desktop application. We have large amounts of configuration data stored in XML files that are parsed and loaded into an SQLite database for further processing when the application is initialized. SQLite is ideal for this situation because it's fast, it requires no specialized configuration, and the database is stored on disk as a single file.
Rationale: Initially I was disappointed with the performance I was seeing. It turns-out that the performance of SQLite can vary significantly (both for bulk-inserts and selects) depending on how the database is configured and how you're using the API. It was not a trivial matter to figure out what all of the options and techniques were, so I thought it prudent to create this community wiki entry to share the results with Stack Overflow readers in order to save others the trouble of the same investigations.
The Experiment: Rather than simply talking about performance tips in the general sense (i.e. ""Use a transaction!""), I thought it best to write some C code and actually measure the impact of various options. We're going to start with some simple data:

A 28 MB TAB-delimited text file (approximately 865,000 records) of the complete transit schedule for the city of Toronto
My test machine is a 3.60 GHz P4 running Windows XP.
The code is compiled with Visual C++ 2005 as ""Release"" with ""Full Optimization"" (/Ox) and Favor Fast Code (/Ot).
I'm using the SQLite ""Amalgamation"", compiled directly into my test application. The SQLite version I happen to have is a bit older (3.6.7), but I suspect these results will be comparable to the latest release (please leave a comment if you think otherwise).

Let's write some code!
The Code: A simple C program that reads the text file line-by-line, splits the string into values and then inserts the data into an SQLite database. In this ""baseline"" version of the code, the database is created, but we won't actually insert data:
/*************************************************************
    Baseline code to experiment with SQLite performance.

The ""Control""
Running the code as-is doesn't actually perform any database operations, but it will give us an idea of how fast the raw C file I/O and string processing operations are.

Imported 864913 records in 0.94
seconds

Great! We can do 920,000 inserts per second, provided we don't actually do any inserts :-)

The ""Worst-Case-Scenario""
We're going to generate the SQL string using the values read from the file and invoke that SQL operation using sqlite3_exec:
sprintf(sSQL, ""INSERT INTO TTC VALUES (NULL, '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s')"", sRT, sBR, sVR, sST, sVI, sDT, sTM);
sqlite3_exec(db, sSQL, NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);

This is going to be slow because the SQL will be compiled into VDBE code for every insert and every insert will happen in its own transaction. How slow?

Imported 864913 records in 9933.61
seconds

Yikes! 2 hours and 45 minutes! That's only 85 inserts per second.
Using a Transaction
By default, SQLite will evaluate every INSERT / UPDATE statement within a unique transaction. If performing a large number of inserts, it's advisable to wrap your operation in a transaction:
sqlite3_exec(db, ""BEGIN TRANSACTION"", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);

pFile = fopen (INPUTDATA,""r"");
while (!feof(pFile)) {

    ...

}
fclose (pFile);

sqlite3_exec(db, ""END TRANSACTION"", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);


Imported 864913 records in 38.03
seconds

That's better. Simply wrapping all of our inserts in a single transaction improved our performance to 23,000 inserts per second.
Using a Prepared Statement
Using a transaction was a huge improvement, but recompiling the SQL statement for every insert doesn't make sense if we using the same SQL over-and-over. Let's use sqlite3_prepare_v2 to compile our SQL statement once and then bind our parameters to that statement using sqlite3_bind_text:
/* Open input file and import into the database */
cStartClock = clock();

sprintf(sSQL, ""INSERT INTO TTC VALUES (NULL, @RT, @BR, @VR, @ST, @VI, @DT, @TM)"");
sqlite3_prepare_v2(db,  sSQL, BUFFER_SIZE, &stmt, &tail);

sqlite3_exec(db, ""BEGIN TRANSACTION"", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);

pFile = fopen (INPUTDATA,""r"");
while (!feof(pFile)) {

    fgets (sInputBuf, BUFFER_SIZE, pFile);

    sRT = strtok (sInputBuf, ""\t"");   /* Get Route */
    sBR = strtok (NULL, ""\t"");        /* Get Branch */
    sVR = strtok (NULL, ""\t"");        /* Get Version */
    sST = strtok (NULL, ""\t"");        /* Get Stop Number */
    sVI = strtok (NULL, ""\t"");        /* Get Vehicle */
    sDT = strtok (NULL, ""\t"");        /* Get Date */
    sTM = strtok (NULL, ""\t"");        /* Get Time */

    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 1, sRT, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 2, sBR, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 3, sVR, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 4, sST, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 5, sVI, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 6, sDT, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 7, sTM, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);

Nice! There's a little bit more code (don't forget to call sqlite3_clear_bindings and sqlite3_reset), but we've more than doubled our performance to 53,000 inserts per second.
PRAGMA synchronous = OFF
By default, SQLite will pause after issuing a OS-level write command. This guarantees that the data is written to the disk. By setting synchronous = OFF, we are instructing SQLite to simply hand-off the data to the OS for writing and then continue. There's a chance that the database file may become corrupted if the computer suffers a catastrophic crash (or power failure) before the data is written to the platter:
/* Open the database and create the schema */
sqlite3_open(DATABASE, &db);
sqlite3_exec(db, TABLE, NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, ""PRAGMA synchronous = OFF"", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);


Imported 864913 records in 12.41
seconds

The improvements are now smaller, but we're up to 69,600 inserts per second.
PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY
Consider storing the rollback journal in memory by evaluating PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY. Your transaction will be faster, but if you lose power or your program crashes during a transaction you database could be left in a corrupt state with a partially-completed transaction:
/* Open the database and create the schema */
sqlite3_open(DATABASE, &db);
sqlite3_exec(db, TABLE, NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, ""PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY"", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);


Imported 864913 records in 13.50
seconds

A little slower than the previous optimization at 64,000 inserts per second.
PRAGMA synchronous = OFF and PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY
Let's combine the previous two optimizations. It's a little more risky (in case of a crash), but we're just importing data (not running a bank):
/* Open the database and create the schema */
sqlite3_open(DATABASE, &db);
sqlite3_exec(db, TABLE, NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, ""PRAGMA synchronous = OFF"", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, ""PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY"", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);


Imported 864913 records in 12.00
seconds

Fantastic! We're able to do 72,000 inserts per second.
Using an In-Memory Database
Just for kicks, let's build upon all of the previous optimizations and redefine the database filename so we're working entirely in RAM:
#define DATABASE "":memory:""


Imported 864913 records in 10.94
seconds

It's not super-practical to store our database in RAM, but it's impressive that we can perform 79,000 inserts per second.
Refactoring C Code
Although not specifically an SQLite improvement, I don't like the extra char* assignment operations in the while loop. Let's quickly refactor that code to pass the output of strtok() directly into sqlite3_bind_text(), and let the compiler try to speed things up for us:
pFile = fopen (INPUTDATA,""r"");
while (!feof(pFile)) {

    fgets (sInputBuf, BUFFER_SIZE, pFile);

    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 1, strtok (sInputBuf, ""\t""), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT); /* Get Route */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 2, strtok (NULL, ""\t""), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Branch */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 3, strtok (NULL, ""\t""), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Version */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 4, strtok (NULL, ""\t""), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Stop Number */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 5, strtok (NULL, ""\t""), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Vehicle */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 6, strtok (NULL, ""\t""), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Date */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 7, strtok (NULL, ""\t""), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Time */

    sqlite3_step(stmt);        /* Execute the SQL Statement */
    sqlite3_clear_bindings(stmt);    /* Clear bindings */
    sqlite3_reset(stmt);        /* Reset VDBE */

    n++;
}
fclose (pFile);

Note: We are back to using a real database file. In-memory databases are fast, but not necessarily practical

Imported 864913 records in 8.94
seconds

A slight refactoring to the string processing code used in our parameter binding has allowed us to perform 96,700 inserts per second. I think it's safe to say that this is plenty fast. As we start to tweak other variables (i.e. page size, index creation, etc.) this will be our benchmark.

Summary (so far)
I hope you're still with me! The reason we started down this road is that bulk-insert performance varies so wildly with SQLite, and it's not always obvious what changes need to be made to speed-up our operation. Using the same compiler (and compiler options), the same version of SQLite and the same data we've optimized our code and our usage of SQLite to go from a worst-case scenario of 85 inserts per second to over 96,000 inserts per second!

CREATE INDEX then INSERT vs. INSERT then CREATE INDEX
Before we start measuring SELECT performance, we know that we'll be creating indices. It's been suggested in one of the answers below that when doing bulk inserts, it is faster to create the index after the data has been inserted (as opposed to creating the index first then inserting the data). Let's try:
Create Index then Insert Data
sqlite3_exec(db, ""CREATE  INDEX 'TTC_Stop_Index' ON 'TTC' ('Stop')"", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, ""BEGIN TRANSACTION"", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);
...


Imported 864913 records in 18.13
seconds

Insert Data then Create Index
...
sqlite3_exec(db, ""END TRANSACTION"", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, ""CREATE  INDEX 'TTC_Stop_Index' ON 'TTC' ('Stop')"", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);


Imported 864913 records in 13.66
seconds

As expected, bulk-inserts are slower if one column is indexed, but it does make a difference if the index is created after the data is inserted. Our no-index baseline is 96,000 inserts per second. Creating the index first then inserting data gives us 47,700 inserts per second, whereas inserting the data first then creating the index gives us 63,300 inserts per second.

I'd gladly take suggestions for other scenarios to try... And will be compiling similar data for SELECT queries soon.

167,1132941,"""Least Astonishment"" and the Mutable Default Argument

Anyone tinkering with Python long enough has been bitten (or torn to pieces) by the following issue:
def foo(a=[]):
    a.append(5)
    return a

Python novices would expect this function called with no parameter to always return a list with only one element: [5]. The result is instead very different, and very astonishing (for a novice):
>>> foo()
[5]
>>> foo()
[5, 5]
>>> foo()
[5, 5, 5]
>>> foo()
[5, 5, 5, 5]
>>> foo()

A manager of mine once had his first encounter with this feature, and called it ""a dramatic design flaw"" of the language. I replied that the behavior had an underlying explanation, and it is indeed very puzzling and unexpected if you don't understand the internals. However, I was not able to answer (to myself) the following question: what is the reason for binding the default argument at function definition, and not at function execution? I doubt the experienced behavior has a practical use (who really used static variables in C, without breeding bugs?)
Edit:
Baczek made an interesting example. Together with most of your comments and Utaal's in particular, I elaborated further:
>>> def a():
...     print(""a executed"")
...     return []
... 
>>>            
>>> def b(x=a()):
...     x.append(5)
...     print(x)
... 
a executed
>>> b()
[5]
>>> b()
[5, 5]

To me, it seems that the design decision was relative to where to put the scope of parameters: inside the function, or ""together"" with it?
Doing the binding inside the function would mean that x is effectively bound to the specified default when the function is called, not defined, something that would present a deep flaw: the def line would be ""hybrid"" in the sense that part of the binding (of the function object) would happen at definition, and part (assignment of default parameters) at function invocation time.
The actual behavior is more consistent: everything of that line gets evaluated when that line is executed, meaning at function definition.

177,1357118,"event.preventDefault() vs. return false

When I want to prevent other event handlers from executing after a certain event is fired, I can use one of two techniques. I'll use jQuery in the examples, but this applies to plain-JS as well:

1. event.preventDefault()

$('a').click(function (e) {
    // custom handling here
    e.preventDefault();
});


2. return false

$('a').click(function () {
    // custom handling here
    return false;
});


Is there any significant difference between those two methods of stopping event propagation?

For me, return false; is simpler, shorter and probably less error prone than executing a method. With the method, you have to remember about correct casing, parenthesis, etc. 

Also, I have to define the first parameter in callback to be able to call the method. Perhaps, there are some reasons why I should avoid doing it like this and use preventDefault instead? What's the better way?

typeof testObject: object
testObject properties:

216,21947452,"Why is printing ""B"" dramatically slower than printing ""#""?

I generated two matrices of 1000 x 1000:

First Matrix: O and #.

Using the following code, the first matrix took 8.52 seconds to complete:

Random r = new Random();

231,30081275,"Why is ""1000000000000000 in range(1000000000000001)"" so fast in Python 3?

It is my understanding that the range() function, which is actually an object type in Python 3, generates its contents on the fly, similar to a generator.
This being the case, I would have expected the following line to take an inordinate amount of time because, in order to determine whether 1 quadrillion is in the range, a quadrillion values would have to be generated:
1_000_000_000_000_000 in range(1_000_000_000_000_001)

Furthermore: it seems that no matter how many zeroes I add on, the calculation more or less takes the same amount of time (basically instantaneous).
I have also tried things like this, but the calculation is still almost instant:
# count by tens
1_000_000_000_000_000_000_000 in range(0,1_000_000_000_000_000_000_001,10)

If I try to implement my own range function, the result is not so nice!
def my_crappy_range(N):
    i = 0
    while i < N:
        yield i
        i += 1
    return

What is the range() object doing under the hood that makes it so fast?

Martijn Pieters's answer was chosen for its completeness, but also see abarnert's first answer for a good discussion of what it means for range to be a full-fledged sequence in Python 3, and some information/warning regarding potential inconsistency for __contains__ function optimization across Python implementations. abarnert's other answer goes into some more detail and provides links for those interested in the history behind the optimization in Python 3 (and lack of optimization of xrange in Python 2). Answers by poke and by wim provide the relevant C source code and explanations for those who are interested.

244,2193953,"Flash CS4 refuses to let go

I have a Flash project, and it has many source files. I have a fairly heavily-used class, call it Jenine. I recently (and, perhaps, callously) relocated Jenine from one namespace to another. I thought we were ready - I thought it was time. The new Jenine was better in every way - she had lost some code bloat, she had decoupled herself from a few vestigial class relationships, and she had finally come home to the namespace that she had always secretly known in her heart was the one she truly belonged to. She was among her own kind.

Unfortunately, Flash would have none of that. Perhaps it had formed an attachment. Perhaps it didn't want Jenine to be decoupled. Either way, it clung to the old, perfect version of Jenine in its memory. It refused to move on. It ignored her (function) calls. It tried to forget her new, public interfaces. Instead, every instance of Jenine that it constructed was always a copy of the old version, down to its classpath:

var jenineInstance:Jenine = new Jenine();
trace( getQualifiedClassName(jenineInstance));
// Should print: com.newnamespace.subspace::Jenine
// Prints: com.oldnamespace.subspace::Jenine
// Ah, young love!


We fought. I'm not proud of some of the things I said or did. In the end, in a towering fit of rage, I deleted all references of Jenine completely. She was utterly, completely erased from the system. My cursor fell upon the ""Empty Trash"" menu option like the cold lid of a casket.

I don't think Flash ever recovered. To this day it still clings to the memory of Jenine. Her old, imperfect definitions still float through my project like abandoned ghosts. Whenever I force Flash to compile, it still lovingly inserts her into my movie, nestling her definition in amongst the other, living classes, like a small shrine. I wonder if they can see her.

Flash and I don't really talk anymore. I write my code, it compiles it. There's a new girl in town named Summer who looks almost identical to Jenine, as if someone had just copied her source-code wholesale into a new class, but Flash hasn't shown any interest. Most days it just mopes around and writes bad poetry in my comments when it thinks I'm not looking.

I hope no one else has had a similar experience, that this is just a singular, painful ripple in the horrifying dark lagoon that is the Flash code-base. Does anyone have any idea how to erase whatever cache the compiler is using?

The best solution I found so far is:

EXTENSION=`echo ""$FILE"" | cut -d'.' -f2`


This is wrong because it doesn't work if the file name contains multiple . characters. If, let's say, I have a.b.js, it will consider a and b.js, instead of a.b and js.

It can be easily done in Python with

287,90178,"Make a div fill the height of the remaining screen space

I am working on a web application where I want the content to fill the height of the entire screen.

The page has a header, which contains a logo, and account information. This could be an arbitrary height. I want the content div to fill the rest of the page to the bottom.

I have a header div and a content div. At the moment I am using a table for the layout like so:

CSS and HTML



#page {
    height: 100%; width: 100%
}

#tdcontent {
    height: 100%;
}

#content {
    overflow: auto; /* or overflow: hidden; */
}
<table id=""page"">
    <tr>
        <td id=""tdheader"">
            <div id=""header"">...</div>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td id=""tdcontent"">
            <div id=""content"">...</div>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>




The entire height of the page is filled, and no scrolling is required.

For anything inside the content div, setting top: 0; will put it right underneath the header. Sometimes the content will be a real table, with its height set to 100%. Putting header inside content will not allow this to work.

Is there a way to achieve the same effect without using the table?

Update:

Elements inside the content div will have heights set to percentages as well. So something at 100% inside the div will fill it to the bottom. As will two elements at 50%.

Update 2:

For instance, if the header takes up 20% of the screen's height, a table specified at 50% inside #content would take up 40% of the screen space. So far, wrapping the entire thing in a table is the only thing that works.

There are several developers who either commit to master or create other branches and later merge into master.

I would do git pull origin master from test. 

Question 1: Is this the right approach?  Other developers could have easily worked on same files as I have worked btw.



My work on test is done and I am ready to merge it back to master. Here are the two ways I can think of:

A:  

git checkout test
git pull origin master
git push origin test
git checkout master
git pull origin test 


B: 

git checkout test
git pull origin master
git checkout master
git merge test


I am not using --rebase because from my understanding, rebase will get the changes from master and stack mine on top of that hence it could overwrite changes other people made.

Question 2: Which one of these two methods is right?  What is the difference there?

The goal in all of this is to keep my test branch updated with the things happening in master and later I could merge them back into master hoping to keep the timeline as linear as possible.

I've been wondering whether there is a good ""git export"" solution that creates a copy of a tree without the .git repository directory. There are at least three methods I know of:

git clone followed by removing the .git repository directory.

git-export is a third-party script that essentially does a git clone into a temporary location followed by rsync --exclude='.git' into the final destination.

329,8547778,"Why are elementwise additions much faster in separate loops than in a combined loop?

Suppose a1, b1, c1, and d1 point to heap memory, and my numerical code has the following core loop.
const int n = 100000;

for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    a1[j] += b1[j];
    c1[j] += d1[j];
}

This loop is executed 10,000 times via another outer for loop. To speed it up, I changed the code to:
for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    a1[j] += b1[j];
}

for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    c1[j] += d1[j];
}

Compiled on Microsoft Visual C++ 10.0 with full optimization and SSE2 enabled for 32-bit on a Intel Core 2 Duo (x64), the first example takes 5.5 seconds and the double-loop example takes only 1.9 seconds.
Disassembly for the first loop basically looks like this (this block is repeated about five times in the full program):
movsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [edx+18h]
addsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [ecx+20h]
movsd       mmword ptr [ecx+20h],xmm0
movsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [esi+10h]
addsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [eax+30h]
movsd       mmword ptr [eax+30h],xmm0
movsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [edx+20h]
addsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [ecx+28h]
movsd       mmword ptr [ecx+28h],xmm0
movsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [esi+18h]
addsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [eax+38h]

Each loop of the double loop example produces this code (the following block is repeated about three times):
addsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [eax+28h]
movsd       mmword ptr [eax+28h],xmm0
movsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [ecx+20h]
addsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [eax+30h]
movsd       mmword ptr [eax+30h],xmm0
movsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [ecx+28h]
addsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [eax+38h]
movsd       mmword ptr [eax+38h],xmm0
movsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [ecx+30h]
addsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [eax+40h]
movsd       mmword ptr [eax+40h],xmm0

The question turned out to be of no relevance, as the behavior severely depends on the sizes of the arrays (n) and the CPU cache. So if there is further interest, I rephrase the question:

Could you provide some solid insight into the details that lead to the different cache behaviors as illustrated by the five regions on the following graph?

It might also be interesting to point out the differences between CPU/cache architectures, by providing a similar graph for these CPUs.

385,10057671,"How does PHP 'foreach' actually work?

Let me prefix this by saying that I know what foreach is, does and how to use it. This question concerns how it works under the bonnet, and I don't want any answers along the lines of ""this is how you loop an array with foreach"".



For a long time I assumed that foreach worked with the array itself. Then I found many references to the fact that it works with a copy of the array, and I have since assumed this to be the end of the story. But I recently got into a discussion on the matter, and after a little experimentation found that this was not in fact 100% true.

Let me show what I mean. For the following test cases, we will be working with the following array:

$array = array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);


Test case 1:

foreach ($array as $item) {
  echo ""$item\n"";
  $array[] = $item;
}
print_r($array);

/* Output in loop:    1 2 3 4 5
   $array after loop: 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 */


This clearly shows that we are not working directly with the source array - otherwise the loop would continue forever, since we are constantly pushing items onto the array during the loop. But just to be sure this is the case:

Test case 2:

foreach ($array as $key => $item) {
  $array[$key + 1] = $item + 2;
  echo ""$item\n"";
}

print_r($array);

/* Output in loop:    1 2 3 4 5
   $array after loop: 1 3 4 5 6 7 */


This backs up our initial conclusion, we are working with a copy of the source array during the loop, otherwise we would see the modified values during the loop. But...

If we look in the manual, we find this statement:


  When foreach first starts executing, the internal array pointer is automatically reset to the first element of the array.


Right... this seems to suggest that foreach relies on the array pointer of the source array. But we've just proved that we're not working with the source array, right? Well, not entirely.

Test case 3:

// Move the array pointer on one to make sure it doesn't affect the loop
var_dump(each($array));

foreach ($array as $item) {
  echo ""$item\n"";
}

var_dump(each($array));

/* Output
  array(4) {
    [1]=>
    int(1)
    [""value""]=>
    int(1)
    [0]=>
    int(0)
    [""key""]=>
    int(0)
  }
  1
  2
  3
  4
  5
  bool(false)
*/


So, despite the fact that we are not working directly with the source array, we are working directly with the source array pointer - the fact that the pointer is at the end of the array at the end of the loop shows this. Except this can't be true - if it was, then test case 1 would loop forever.

The PHP manual also states:


  As foreach relies on the internal array pointer changing it within the loop may lead to unexpected behavior.


Well, let's find out what that ""unexpected behavior"" is (technically, any behavior is unexpected since I no longer know what to expect).

Test case 4:

foreach ($array as $key => $item) {
  echo ""$item\n"";
  each($array);
}

/* Output: 1 2 3 4 5 */


Test case 5:

foreach ($array as $key => $item) {
  echo ""$item\n"";
  reset($array);
}

/* Output: 1 2 3 4 5 */


...nothing that unexpected there, in fact it seems to support the ""copy of source"" theory.



The Question

What is going on here? My C-fu is not good enough for me to able to extract a proper conclusion simply by looking at the PHP source code, I would appreciate it if someone could translate it into English for me.

It seems to me that foreach works with a copy of the array, but sets the array pointer of the source array to the end of the array after the loop.


Is this correct and the whole story?
If not, what is it really doing?
Is there any situation where using functions that adjust the array pointer (each(), reset() et al.) during a foreach could affect the outcome of the loop?

400,5062614,"How to decide when to use Node.js?

I am new to this kind of stuff, but lately I've been hearing a lot about how good Node.js is. Considering how much I love working with jQuery and JavaScript in general, I can't help but wonder how to decide when to use Node.js. The web application I have in mind is something like Bitly - takes some content, archives it. 

From all the homework I have been doing in the last few days, I obtained the following information. Node.js 


is a command-line tool that can be run as a regular web server and lets one run JavaScript programs
utilizes the great V8 JavaScript engine
is very good when you need to do several things at the same time
is event-based so all the wonderful Ajax-like stuff can be done on the server side
lets us share code between the browser and the backend
lets us talk with MySQL

C++11 introduced a standardized memory model, but what exactly does that mean? And how is it going to affect C++ programming?
This article (by Gavin Clarke who quotes Herb Sutter) says that,

The memory model means that C++ code
now has a standardized library to call
regardless of who made the compiler
and on what platform it's running.
There's a standard way to control how
different threads talk to the
processor's memory.
""When you are talking about splitting
[code] across different cores that's
in the standard, we are talking about
the memory model. We are going to
optimize it without breaking the
following assumptions people are going
to make in the code,"" Sutter said.

Well, I can memorize this and similar paragraphs available online (as I've had my own memory model since birth :P) and can even post as an answer to questions asked by others, but to be honest, I don't exactly understand this.
C++ programmers used to develop multi-threaded applications even before, so how does it matter if it's POSIX threads, or Windows threads, or C++11 threads? What are the benefits? I want to understand the low-level details.
I also get this feeling that the C++11 memory model is somehow related to C++11 multi-threading support, as I often see these two together. If it is, how exactly? Why should they be related?

I have recently stumbled upon the game 2048. You merge similar tiles by moving them in any of the four directions to make ""bigger"" tiles. After each move, a new tile appears at random empty position with a value of either 2 or 4. The game terminates when all the boxes are filled and there are no moves that can merge tiles, or you create a tile with a value of 2048.

One, I need to follow a well-defined strategy to reach the goal. So, I thought of writing a program for it.

My current algorithm:

while (!game_over) {
    for each possible move:
        count_no_of_merges_for_2-tiles and 4-tiles
    choose the move with a large number of merges
}


What I am doing is at any point, I will try to merge the tiles with values 2 and 4, that is, I try to have 2 and 4 tiles, as minimum as possible. If I try it this way, all other tiles were automatically getting merged and the strategy seems good.

But, when I actually use this algorithm, I only get around 4000 points before the game terminates. Maximum points AFAIK is slightly more than 20,000 points which is way larger than my current score. Is there a better algorithm than the above?

"
454,35062852,"NPM vs. Bower vs. Browserify vs. Gulp vs. Grunt vs. Webpack

I'm trying to summarize my knowledge about the most popular JavaScript package managers, bundlers, and task runners. Please correct me if I'm wrong:


npm & bower are package managers. They just download the dependencies and don't know how to build projects on their own. What they know is to call webpack/gulp/grunt after fetching all the dependencies.
bower is like npm, but builds a flattened dependency trees (unlike npm which does it recursively). Meaning npm fetches the dependencies for each dependency (may fetch the same a few times), while bower expects you to manually include sub-dependencies. Sometimes bower and npm are used together for front-end and back-end respectively (since each megabyte might matter in front-end).
grunt and gulp are task runners to automate everything that can be automated (i.e. compile CSS/Sass, optimize images, make a bundle and minify/transpile it).
grunt vs. gulp (is like maven vs. gradle or configuration vs. code). Grunt is based on configuring separate independent tasks, each task opens/handles/closes file. Gulp requires less amount of code and is based on Node streams, which allows it to build pipe chains (w/o reopening the same file) and makes it faster. 
webpack (webpack-dev-server) - for me it's a task runner with hot reloading of changes which allows you to forget about all JS/CSS watchers. 
npm/bower + plugins may replace task runners. Their abilities often intersect so there are different implications if you need to use gulp/grunt over npm + plugins. But task runners are definitely better for complex tasks (e.g. ""on each build create bundle, transpile from ES6 to ES5, run it at all browsers emulators, make screenshots and deploy to dropbox through ftp"").
browserify allows packaging node modules for browsers. browserify vs node's require is actually AMD vs CommonJS.


Questions:


What is webpack & webpack-dev-server? Official documentation says it's a module bundler but for me it's just a task runner. What's the difference?
Where would you use browserify? Can't we do the same with node/ES6 imports? 
When would you use gulp/grunt over npm + plugins?
Please provide examples when you need to use a combination

Borgar suggested testing for a Date instance, and then testing for the Date's time value. If the date is invalid, the time value is NaN. I checked with ECMA-262 and this behavior is in the standard, which is exactly what I'm looking for.

486,2155930,"How do I remedy ""The breakpoint will not currently be hit. No symbols have been loaded for this document."" warning?

A C# desktop application (on the Visual Studio Express edition) worked, but then it didn't work 5 seconds later.
I tried the following:

Ensure debug configuration, debug flag, and full debug information are set on all assemblies.
Delete all bin and obj folders and all DLL files related to the project from my entire machine.
Recreate projects causing the problem from scratch.
Reboot.

I have two Windows Forms projects in the solution. One of them loads the debug information, one doesn't. They both refer to the assembly I'm trying to get debug information on in exactly the same way in the project file. Any ideas?

I want to add here, mostly for myself when I come back to review this question, that symbols are not loaded until the assembly is loaded, and the assembly is not loaded until it is needed. If the breakpoint is in a library that is only used in one function in your main assembly, the symbols will not be loaded (and it will show the breakpoint as not being hit) until that function is called.

544,10168686,"Image Processing: Algorithm Improvement for 'Coca-Cola Can' Recognition

One of the most interesting projects I've worked on in the past couple of years was a project about image processing. The goal was to develop a system to be able to recognize Coca-Cola 'cans' (note that I'm stressing the word 'cans', you'll see why in a minute). You can see a sample below, with the can recognized in the green rectangle with scale and rotation.



Some constraints on the project:


The background could be very noisy.
The can could have any scale or rotation or even orientation (within reasonable limits).
The image could have some degree of fuzziness (contours might not be entirely straight).
There could be Coca-Cola bottles in the image, and the algorithm should only detect the can!
The brightness of the image could vary a lot (so you can't rely ""too much"" on color detection).
The can could be partly hidden on the sides or the middle and possibly partly hidden behind a bottle.
There could be no can at all in the image, in which case you had to find nothing and write a message saying so.


So you could end up with tricky things like this (which in this case had my algorithm totally fail):



I did this project a while ago, and had a lot of fun doing it, and I had a decent implementation. Here are some details about my implementation:

Language: Done in C++ using OpenCV library.

Pre-processing: For the image pre-processing, i.e. transforming the image into a more raw form to give to the algorithm, I used 2 methods:


Changing color domain from RGB to HSV and filtering based on ""red"" hue, saturation above a certain threshold to avoid orange-like colors, and filtering of low value to avoid dark tones. The end result was a binary black and white image, where all white pixels would represent the pixels that match this threshold. Obviously there is still a lot of crap in the image, but this reduces the number of dimensions you have to work with.
  
Noise filtering using median filtering (taking the median pixel value of all neighbors and replace the pixel by this value) to reduce noise.
Using Canny Edge Detection Filter to get the contours of all items after 2 precedent steps.



Algorithm: The algorithm itself I chose for this task was taken from this awesome book on feature extraction and called Generalized Hough Transform (pretty different from the regular Hough Transform). It basically says a few things:


You can describe an object in space without knowing its analytical equation (which is the case here).
It is resistant to image deformations such as scaling and rotation, as it will basically test your image for every combination of scale factor and rotation factor.
It uses a base model (a template) that the algorithm will ""learn"".
Each pixel remaining in the contour image will vote for another pixel which will supposedly be the center (in terms of gravity) of your object, based on what it learned from the model.


In the end, you end up with a heat map of the votes, for example here all the pixels of the contour of the can will vote for its gravitational center, so you'll have a lot of votes in the same pixel corresponding to the center, and will see a peak in the heat map as below:



Once you have that, a simple threshold-based heuristic can give you the location of the center pixel, from which you can derive the scale and rotation and then plot your little rectangle around it (final scale and rotation factor will obviously be relative to your original template). In theory at least...

Results: Now, while this approach worked in the basic cases, it was severely lacking in some areas:


It is extremely slow! I'm not stressing this enough. Almost a full day was needed to process the 30 test images, obviously because I had a very high scaling factor for rotation and translation, since some of the cans were very small.
It was completely lost when bottles were in the image, and for some reason almost always found the bottle instead of the can (perhaps because bottles were bigger, thus had more pixels, thus more votes)
Fuzzy images were also no good, since the votes ended up in pixel at random locations around the center, thus ending with a very noisy heat map.
In-variance in translation and rotation was achieved, but not in orientation, meaning that a can that was not directly facing the camera objective wasn't recognized.


Can you help me improve my specific algorithm, using exclusively OpenCV features, to resolve the four specific issues mentioned?

I hope some people will also learn something out of it as well, after all I think not only people who ask questions should learn. :)

545,3331353,"Transitions on the CSS display property

I'm currently designing a CSS 'mega dropdown' menu - basically a regular CSS-only dropdown menu, but one that contains different types of content.

At the moment, it appears that CSS 3 transitions don't apply to the 'display' property, i.e., you can't do any sort of transition from display: none to display: block (or any combination).

Is there a way for the second-tier menu from the above example to 'fade in' when someone hovers over one of the top level menu items?

I'm aware that you can use transitions on the visibility: property, but I can't think of a way to use that effectively.

I've also tried using height, but that just failed miserably.

I'm also aware that it's trivial to achieve this using JavaScript, but I wanted to challenge myself to use just CSS, and I think I'm coming up a little short.

546,10660435,"How do I split the definition of a long string over multiple lines?

I have a very long query. I would like to split it in several lines in Python.

Example:

555,538060,"Proper use of the IDisposable interface

I know from reading Microsoft documentation that the ""primary"" use of the IDisposable interface is to clean up unmanaged resources.
To me, ""unmanaged"" means things like database connections, sockets, window handles, etc.  But, I've seen code where the Dispose() method is implemented to free managed resources, which seems redundant to me, since the garbage collector should take care of that for you.
For example:
public class MyCollection : IDisposable
{
    private List<String> _theList = new List<String>();
    private Dictionary<String, Point> _theDict = new Dictionary<String, Point>();

    // Die, clear it up! (free unmanaged resources)

        _theDict.clear();
        _theList = null;
        _theDict = null;
    }
}

My question is, does this make the garbage collector free memory used by MyCollection any faster than it normally would?

Edit:  So far people have posted some good examples of using IDisposable to clean up unmanaged resources such as database connections and bitmaps.  But suppose that _theList in the above code contained a million strings, and you wanted to free that memory now, rather than waiting for the garbage collector.  Would the above code accomplish that?

"
563,8898925,"Is there a reason for C#'s reuse of the variable in a foreach?

When using lambda expressions or anonymous methods in C#, we have to be wary of the access to modified closure pitfall. For example:

foreach (var s in strings)
{
   query = query.Where(i => i.Prop == s); // access to modified closure
   ...
}


Due to the modified closure, the above code will cause all of the Where clauses on the query to be based on the final value of s.

As explained here, this happens because the s variable declared in foreach loop above is translated like this in the compiler:

string s;
while (enumerator.MoveNext())
{
   s = enumerator.Current;
   ...
}


instead of like this:

while (enumerator.MoveNext())
{
   string s;
   s = enumerator.Current;
   ...
}


As pointed out here, there are no performance advantages to declaring a variable outside the loop, and under normal circumstances the only reason I can think of for doing this is if you plan to use the variable outside the scope of the loop:

string s;
while (enumerator.MoveNext())
{
   s = enumerator.Current;
   ...
}
var finalString = s;


However variables defined in a foreach loop cannot be used outside the loop:

foreach(string s in strings)
{
}
var finalString = s; // won't work: you're outside the scope.


So the compiler declares the variable in a way that makes it highly prone to an error that is often difficult to find and debug, while producing no perceivable benefits.

Is there something you can do with foreach loops this way that you couldn't if they were compiled with an inner-scoped variable, or is this just an arbitrary choice that was made before anonymous methods and lambda expressions were available or common, and which hasn't been revised since then?

I'm using Git on a new project that has two parallel -- but currently experimental -- development branches:

exp1: experimental branch #1
exp2: experimental branch #2

exp1 and exp2 represent two very different architectural approaches. Until I get further along I have no way of knowing which one (if either) will work. As I make progress in one branch I sometimes have edits that would be useful in the other branch and would like to merge just those.
What is the best way to merge selective changes from one development branch to another while leaving behind everything else?
Approaches I've considered:

git merge --no-commit followed by manual unstaging of a large number of edits that I don't want to make common between the branches.

Manual copying of common files into a temporary directory followed by git checkout to move to the other branch and then more manual copying out of the temporary directory into the working tree.

A variation on the above. Abandon the exp branches for now and use two additional local repositories for experimentation.  This makes the manual copying of files much more straightforward.


All three of these approaches seem tedious and error-prone.  I'm hoping there is a better approach; something akin to a filter path parameter that would make git-merge more selective.

What's the proper way to declare custom exception classes in modern Python? My primary goal is to follow whatever standard other exception classes have, so that (for instance) any extra string I include in the exception is printed out by whatever tool caught the exception.
By ""modern Python"" I mean something that will run in Python 2.5 but be 'correct' for the Python 2.6 and Python 3.* way of doing things. And by ""custom"" I mean an Exception object that can include extra data about the cause of the error: a string, maybe also some other arbitrary object relevant to the exception.
I was tripped up by the following deprecation warning in Python 2.6.2:
>>> class MyError(Exception):
...     def __init__(self, message):
...         self.message = message
... 
>>> MyError(""foo"")
_sandbox.py:3: DeprecationWarning: BaseException.message has been deprecated as of Python 2.6

It seems crazy that BaseException has a special meaning for attributes named message. I gather from PEP-352 that attribute did have a special meaning in 2.5 they're trying to deprecate away, so I guess that name (and that one alone) is now forbidden? Ugh.
I'm also fuzzily aware that Exception has some magic parameter args, but I've never known how to use it. Nor am I sure it's the right way to do things going forward; a lot of the discussion I found online suggested they were trying to do away with args in Python 3.

The tables were just basic stuff with some border styles to add some lines at various points;

It rendered some of the images (all the images are Google Chart URLs) and the table formatting was much better but it seemed to have some complexity problem I haven't figured out yet and kept dying with unknown node_type() errors.  Not sure where to go from here; and
Htmldoc: this seems to work fine on basic HTML but has almost no support for CSS whatsoever so you have to do everything in HTML (I didn't realize it was still 2001 in Htmldoc-land...) so it's useless to me.

"
660,21692193,"Why not inherit from List<T>?

When planning out my programs, I often start with a chain of thought like so:


  A football team is just a list of football players. Therefore, I should represent it with:

var football_team = new List<FootballPlayer>();

  
  The ordering of this list represent the order in which the players are listed in the roster.


But I realize later that teams also have other properties, besides the mere list of players, that must be recorded. For example, the running total of scores this season, the current budget, the uniform colors, a string representing the name of the team, etc..

So then I think:


  Okay, a football team is just like a list of players, but additionally, it has a name (a string) and a running total of scores (an int). .NET does not provide a class for storing football teams, so I will make my own class. The most similar and relevant existing structure is List<FootballPlayer>, so I will inherit from it:

class FootballTeam : List<FootballPlayer> 
{ 
    public string TeamName; 
    public int RunningTotal 
}



But it turns out that a guideline says you shouldn't inherit from List<T>. I'm thoroughly confused by this guideline in two respects.

Why not?

Apparently List is somehow optimized for performance. How so? What performance problems will I cause if I extend List? What exactly will break?

Another reason I've seen is that List is provided by Microsoft, and I have no control over it, so I cannot change it later, after exposing a ""public API"". But I struggle to understand this. What is a public API and why should I care? If my current project does not and is not likely to ever have this public API, can I safely ignore this guideline? If I do inherit from List and it turns out I need a public API, what difficulties will I have?

Why does it even matter? A list is a list. What could possibly change? What could I possibly want to change?

And lastly, if Microsoft did not want me to inherit from List, why didn't they make the class sealed?

What else am I supposed to use?

Apparently, for custom collections, Microsoft has provided a Collection class which should be extended instead of List. But this class is very bare, and does not have many useful things, such as AddRange, for instance. jvitor83's answer provides a performance rationale for that particular method, but how is a slow AddRange not better than no AddRange?

Inheriting from Collection is way more work than inheriting from List, and I see no benefit. Surely Microsoft wouldn't tell me to do extra work for no reason, so I can't help feeling like I am somehow misunderstanding something, and inheriting Collection is actually not the right solution for my problem.

I've seen suggestions such as implementing IList. Just no. This is dozens of lines of boilerplate code which gains me nothing.

Lastly, some suggest wrapping the List in something: 

class FootballTeam 
{ 
    public List<FootballPlayer> Players; 
}


There are two problems with this:


It makes my code needlessly verbose. I must now call my_team.Players.Count instead of just my_team.Count. Thankfully, with C# I can define indexers to make indexing transparent, and forward all the methods of the internal List... But that's a lot of code! What do I get for all that work?
It just plain doesn't make any sense. A football team doesn't ""have"" a list of players. It is the list of players. You don't say ""John McFootballer has joined SomeTeam's players"". You say ""John has joined SomeTeam"". You don't add a letter to ""a string's characters"", you add a letter to a string. You don't add a book to a library's books, you add a book to a library.


I realize that what happens ""under the hood"" can be said to be ""adding X to Y's internal list"", but this seems like a very counter-intuitive way of thinking about the world.

My question (summarized)

What is the correct C# way of representing a data structure, which, ""logically"" (that is to say, ""to the human mind"") is just a list of things with a few bells and whistles?

Is inheriting from List<T> always unacceptable? When is it acceptable? Why/why not? What must a programmer consider, when deciding whether to inherit from List<T> or not?

Many of you have probably seen the command that allows you to write on a file that needs root permission, even when you forgot to open vim with sudo:

The thing is that I don't get what is exactly happening here.

I have already figured this:
w is for this

                        (note the space in front of the '!').  {cmd} is
                        executed like with "":!{cmd}"", any '!' is replaced with
                        the previous command |:!|.


so it passes all the lines as standard input.

The !sudo tee part calls tee with administrator privileges.

For all to make sense, the % should output the filename (as a parameter for tee), but I can't find references on the help for this behavior.

I'm having a hard time getting my head around font scaling.

I currently have a website with a body font-size of 100%. 100% of what though? This seems to compute out at 16 pixels.

I was under the impression that 100% would somehow refer to the size of the browser window, but apparently not because it's always 16 pixels whether the window is resized down to a mobile width or full-blown widescreen desktop.

How can I make the text on my site scale in relation to its container? I tried using em, but this doesn't scale either.

My reasoning is that things like my menu become squished when you resize, so I need to reduce the px font-size of .menuItem among other elements in relation to the width of the container. (For example, in the menu on a large desktop, 22px works perfectly. Move down to tablet width and 16px is more appropriate.)

I'm aware I can add breakpoints, but I really want the text to scale as well as having extra breakpoints, otherwise, I'll end up with hundreds of breakpoints for every 100pixels decrease in width to control the text.

On my computer, this consistently prints out a value around 0.96..

When I wrap the for loop inside Fibo() with a try-catch block like this:

static long Fibo(int n)
{
    long n1 = 0, n2 = 1, fibo = 0;
    n++;

    try

            n2 = fibo;
            fibo = n1 + n2;
        }
    }
    catch {}

    return fibo;
}


Now it consistently prints out 0.69... -- it actually runs faster! But why?

Note: I compiled this using the Release configuration and directly ran the EXE file (outside Visual Studio).

EDIT: Jon Skeet's excellent analysis shows that try-catch is somehow causing the x86 CLR to use the CPU registers in a more favorable way in this specific case (and I think we're yet to understand why). I confirmed Jon's finding that x64 CLR doesn't have this difference, and that it was faster than the x86 CLR. I also tested using int types inside the Fibo method instead of long types, and then the x86 CLR was as equally fast as the x64 CLR.



UPDATE: It looks like this issue has been fixed by Roslyn. Same machine, same CLR version -- the issue remains as above when compiled with VS 2013, but the problem goes away when compiled with VS 2015.

As you see, we create a buffer of random data, with the size being x megabytes where x is read from the command line. Afterwards, we iterate over the buffer and use an unrolled version of the x86 popcount intrinsic to perform the popcount. To get a more precise result, we do the popcount 10,000 times. We measure the times for the popcount. In the upper case, the inner loop variable is unsigned, in the lower case, the inner loop variable is uint64_t. I thought that this should make no difference, but the opposite is the case.

The (absolutely crazy) results

I compile it like this (g++ version: Ubuntu 4.8.2-19ubuntu1):

g++ -O3 -march=native -std=c++11 test.cpp -o test


Here are the results on my Haswell Core i7-4770K CPU @ 3.50 GHz, running test 1 (so 1 MB random data):


unsigned  41959360000  0.401554 sec   26.113 GB/s
uint64_t  41959360000  0.759822 sec   13.8003 GB/s


As you see, the throughput of the uint64_t version is only half the one of the unsigned version! The problem seems to be that different assembly gets generated, but why? First, I thought of a compiler bug, so I tried clang++ (Ubuntu Clang version 3.4-1ubuntu3):

clang++ -O3 -march=native -std=c++11 teest.cpp -o test


Result: test 1


unsigned  41959360000  0.398293 sec   26.3267 GB/s
uint64_t  41959360000  0.680954 sec   15.3986 GB/s


So, it is almost the same result and is still strange. But now it gets super strange. I replace the buffer size that was read from input with a constant 1, so I change:

uint64_t size = atol(argv[1]) << 20;


to

uint64_t size = 1 << 20;


Thus, the compiler now knows the buffer size at compile time. Maybe it can add some optimizations! Here are the numbers for g++:


unsigned  41959360000  0.509156 sec   20.5944 GB/s
uint64_t  41959360000  0.508673 sec   20.6139 GB/s


Now, both versions are equally fast. However, the unsigned got even slower! It dropped from 26 to 20 GB/s, thus replacing a non-constant by a constant value lead to a deoptimization. Seriously, I have no clue what is going on here! But now to clang++ with the new version:


unsigned  41959360000  0.677009 sec   15.4884 GB/s
uint64_t  41959360000  0.676909 sec   15.4906 GB/s


Wait, what? Now, both versions dropped to the slow number of 15 GB/s. Thus, replacing a non-constant by a constant value even lead to slow code in both cases for Clang!

I asked a colleague with an Ivy Bridge CPU to compile my benchmark. He got similar results, so it does not seem to be Haswell. Because two compilers produce strange results here, it also does not seem to be a compiler bug. We do not have an AMD CPU here, so we could only test with Intel.

More madness, please!

Take the first example (the one with atol(argv[1])) and put a static before the variable, i.e.:

static uint64_t size=atol(argv[1])<<20;


Here are my results in g++:


unsigned  41959360000  0.396728 sec   26.4306 GB/s
uint64_t  41959360000  0.509484 sec   20.5811 GB/s


Yay, yet another alternative. We still have the fast 26 GB/s with u32, but we managed to get u64 at least from the 13 GB/s to the 20 GB/s version! On my collegue's PC, the u64 version became even faster than the u32 version, yielding the fastest result of all. Sadly, this only works for g++, clang++ does not seem to care about static.

My question

Can you explain these results? Especially:


How can there be such a difference between u32 and u64?
How can replacing a non-constant by a constant buffer size trigger less optimal code?
How can the insertion of the static keyword make the u64 loop faster? Even faster than the original code on my collegue's computer!


I know that optimization is a tricky territory, however, I never thought that such small changes can lead to a 100% difference in execution time and that small factors like a constant buffer size can again mix results totally. Of course, I always want to have the version that is able to popcount 26 GB/s. The only reliable way I can think of is copy paste the assembly for this case and use inline assembly. This is the only way I can get rid of compilers that seem to go mad on small changes. What do you think? Is there another way to reliably get the code with most performance?

Interestingly, the fastest (26 GB/s) version is also the longest! It seems to be the only solution that uses lea. Some versions use jb to jump, others use jne. But apart from that, all versions seem to be comparable. I don't see where a 100% performance gap could originate from, but I am not too adept at deciphering assembly. The slowest (13 GB/s) version looks even very short and good. Can anyone explain this?

Lessons learned

No matter what the answer to this question will be; I have learned that in really hot loops every detail can matter, even details that do not seem to have any association to the hot code. I have never thought about what type to use for a loop variable, but as you see such a minor change can make a 100% difference! Even the storage type of a buffer can make a huge difference, as we saw with the insertion of the static keyword in front of the size variable! In the future, I will always test various alternatives on various compilers when writing really tight and hot loops that are crucial for system performance.

The interesting thing is also that the performance difference is still so high although I have already unrolled the loop four times. So even if you unroll, you can still get hit by major performance deviations. Quite interesting.

709,295579,"Fastest way to determine if an integer's square root is an integer

I'm looking for the fastest way to determine if a long value is a perfect square (i.e. its square root is another integer): 


I've done it the easy way, by using the built-in Math.sqrt()
function, but I'm wondering if there is a way to do it faster by
restricting yourself to integer-only domain.
Maintaining a lookup table is impractical (since there are about
231.5 integers whose square is less than 263).


Here is the very simple and straightforward way I'm doing it now:

public final static boolean isPerfectSquare(long n)
{
  if (n < 0)
    return false;

  long tst = (long)(Math.sqrt(n) + 0.5);
  return tst*tst == n;
}


Note: I'm using this function in many Project Euler problems.  So no one else will ever have to maintain this code.  And this kind of micro-optimization could actually make a difference, since part of the challenge is to do every algorithm in less than a minute, and this function will need to be called millions of times in some problems.



I've tried the different solutions to the problem:


After exhaustive testing, I found that adding 0.5 to the result of Math.sqrt() is not necessary, at least not on my machine.
The fast inverse square root was faster, but it gave incorrect results for n >= 410881.  However, as suggested by BobbyShaftoe, we can use the FISR hack for n < 410881.
Newton's method was a good bit slower than Math.sqrt().  This is probably because Math.sqrt() uses something similar to Newton's Method, but implemented in the hardware so it's much faster than in Java.  Also, Newton's Method still required use of doubles.
A modified Newton's method, which used a few tricks so that only integer math was involved, required some hacks to avoid overflow (I want this function to work with all positive 64-bit signed integers), and it was still slower than Math.sqrt().
Binary chop was even slower.  This makes sense because the binary chop will on average require 16 passes to find the square root of a 64-bit number.
According to John's tests, using or statements is faster in C++ than using a switch, but in Java and C# there appears to be no difference between or and switch.
I also tried making a lookup table (as a private static array of 64 boolean values).  Then instead of either switch or or statement, I would just say if(lookup[(int)(n&0x3F)]) { test } else return false;.  To my surprise, this was (just slightly) slower. This is because array bounds are checked in Java.

In HTTP there are two ways to POST data: application/x-www-form-urlencoded and multipart/form-data. I understand that most browsers are only able to upload files if multipart/form-data is used. Is there any additional guidance when to use one of the encoding types in an API context (no browser involved)? This might e.g. be based on:


data size
existence of non-ASCII characters
existence on (unencoded) binary data
the need to transfer additional data (like filename)


I basically found no formal guidance on the web regarding the use of the different content-types so far.

Trapping the exception and showing

Disabling post validation (validateRequest=""false"") will definitely avoid this error, but it will leave the page vulnerable to a number of attacks.

745,761194,"Interface vs Abstract Class (general OO)

I have recently had two telephone interviews where I've been asked about the differences between an Interface and an Abstract class. I have explained every aspect of them I could think of, but it seems they are waiting for me to mention something specific, and I don't know what it is.
From my experience I think the following is true. If I am missing a major point please let me know.
Interface:
Every single Method declared in an Interface will have to be implemented in the subclass.
Only Events, Delegates, Properties (C#) and Methods can exist in an Interface. A class can implement multiple Interfaces.
Abstract Class:
Only Abstract methods have to be implemented by the subclass. An Abstract class can have normal methods with implementations. An Abstract class can also have class variables besides Events, Delegates, Properties and Methods. A class can implement one abstract class only due to the non-existence of Multi-inheritance in C#.

After all that, the interviewer came up with the question ""What if you had an Abstract class with only abstract methods? How would that be different from an interface?"" I didn't know the answer but I think it's the inheritance as mentioned above right?

Another interviewer asked me, ""What if you had a Public variable inside the interface, how would that be different than in a Abstract Class?"" I insisted you can't have a public variable inside an interface. I didn't know what he wanted to hear but he wasn't satisfied either.

747,6760685,"Creating a singleton in Python

This question is not for the discussion of whether or not the singleton design pattern is desirable, is an anti-pattern, or for any religious wars, but to discuss how this pattern is best implemented in Python in such a way that is most pythonic. In this instance I define 'most pythonic' to mean that it follows the 'principle of least astonishment'.
I have multiple classes which would become singletons (my use-case is for a logger, but this is not important). I do not wish to clutter several classes with added gumph when I can simply inherit or decorate.
Best methods:

Method 1: A decorator
def singleton(class_):
    instances = {}
    def getinstance(*args, **kwargs):
        if class_ not in instances:
            instances[class_] = class_(*args, **kwargs)
        return instances[class_]
    return getinstance

@singleton
class MyClass(BaseClass):
    pass

Pros

Decorators are additive in a way that is often more intuitive than multiple inheritance.

Cons

While objects created using MyClass() would be true singleton objects, MyClass itself is a function, not a class, so you cannot call class methods from it. Also for
x = MyClass();
y = MyClass();
t = type(n)();



then x == y but x != t && y != t

Method 2: A base class
class Singleton(object):
    _instance = None
    def __new__(class_, *args, **kwargs):
        if not isinstance(class_._instance, class_):
            class_._instance = object.__new__(class_, *args, **kwargs)
        return class_._instance

class MyClass(Singleton, BaseClass):
    pass

Pros

It's a true class

Cons

Multiple inheritance - eugh! __new__ could be overwritten during inheritance from a second base class? One has to think more than is necessary.


Method 3: A metaclass
class Singleton(type):
    _instances = {}
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            cls._instances[cls] = super(Singleton, cls).__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        return cls._instances[cls]

#Python2
class MyClass(BaseClass):
    __metaclass__ = Singleton

#Python3
class MyClass(BaseClass, metaclass=Singleton):
    pass

Pros

It's a true class
Auto-magically covers inheritance
Uses __metaclass__ for its proper purpose (and made me aware of it)

Cons

Are there any?


Method 4: decorator returning a class with the same name
def singleton(class_):
    class class_w(class_):
        _instance = None
        def __new__(class_, *args, **kwargs):
            if class_w._instance is None:
                class_w._instance = super(class_w,
                                    class_).__new__(class_,
                                                    *args,
                                                    **kwargs)
                class_w._instance._sealed = False
            return class_w._instance
        def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
            if self._sealed:
                return
            super(class_w, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
            self._sealed = True
    class_w.__name__ = class_.__name__
    return class_w

@singleton
class MyClass(BaseClass):
    pass

Pros

It's a true class
Auto-magically covers inheritance

Cons

Is there not an overhead for creating each new class? Here we are creating two classes for each class we wish to make a singleton. While this is fine in my case, I worry that this might not scale. Of course there is a matter of debate as to whether it aught to be too easy to scale this pattern...
What is the point of the _sealed attribute
Can't call methods of the same name on base classes using super() because they will recurse. This means you can't customize __new__ and can't subclass a class that needs you to call up to __init__.


Method 5: a module
a module file singleton.py
Pros

Simple is better than complex

Cons

Not lazily instantiated

For duplicate closers: if a beginner is asking a question about trying to make output appear immediately while not using a newline at the end, please instead use Why doesn't print output show up immediately in the terminal when there is no newline at the end? to close the question. The current question isn't good enough because the person asking will likely not have a concept of buffering or flushing; the other question is intended to explain those concepts first, whereas this question is about the technical details.

I've been here:

Python packages: relative imports
python relative import example code does not work
Relative imports in python 2.5
Relative imports in Python
Python: Disabling relative import

and plenty of URLs that I did not copy, some on SO, some on other sites, back when I thought I'd have the solution quickly.
The forever-recurring question is this: how do I solve this ""Attempted relative import in non-package"" message?
ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package

I built an exact replica of the package on pep-0328:
package/
    __init__.py
    subpackage1/
        __init__.py
        moduleX.py
        moduleY.py
    subpackage2/
        __init__.py
        moduleZ.py
    moduleA.py

The imports were done from the console.
I did make functions named spam and eggs in their appropriate modules.  Naturally, it didn't work.  The answer is apparently in the 4th URL I listed, but it's all alumni to me. There was this response on one of the URLs I visited:

Relative imports use a module's name attribute to determine that module's position in the package hierarchy. If the module's name does not contain any package information (e.g. it is set to 'main') then relative imports are resolved as if the module were a top level module, regardless of where the module is actually located on the file system.

The above response looks promising, but it's all hieroglyphs to me.  So my question, how do I make Python not return to me ""Attempted relative import in non-package""? has an answer that involves -m, supposedly.
Can somebody please tell me why Python gives that error message, what it means by ""non-package"", why and how do you define a 'package', and the precise answer put in terms easy enough for a kindergartener to understand.

833,1866794,"Naming Classes - How to avoid calling everything a ""<WhatEver>Manager""?

A long time ago I have read an article (I believe a blog entry) which put me on the ""right"" track on naming objects: Be very very scrupulous about naming things in your program.

For example if my application was (as a typical business app) handling users, companies and addresses I'd have a User, a Company and an Address domain class - and probably somewhere a UserManager, a CompanyManager and an AddressManager would pop up that handles those things.

So can you tell what those UserManager, CompanyManager and AddressManager do? No, because Manager is a very very generic term that fits to anything you can do with your domain objects.

The article I read recommended using very specific names. If it was a C++ application and the UserManager's job was allocating and freeing users from the heap it would not manage the users but guard their birth and death. Hmm, maybe we could call this a UserShepherd.

Or maybe the UserManager's job is to examine each User object's data and sign the data cryptographically. Then we'd have a UserRecordsClerk.

Now that this idea stuck with me I try to apply it. And find this simple idea amazingly hard.

I can describe what the classes do and (as long as I don't slip into quick & dirty coding) the classes I write do exactly one thing. What I miss to go from that description to the names is a kind of catalogue of names, a vocabulary that maps the concepts to names.

Ultimately I'd like to have something like a pattern catalogue in my mind (frequently design patterns easily provide the object names, e.g. a factory)


Factory - Creates other objects (naming taken from the design pattern)
Shepherd - A shepherd handles the lifetime of objects, their creation and shutdown
Synchronizer - Copies data between two or more objects (or object hierarchies)
Nanny - Helps objects reach ""usable"" state after creation - for example by wiring to other objects
etc etc.


So, how do you handle that issue? Do you have a fixed vocabulary, do you invent new names on the fly or do you consider naming things not-so-important or wrong?

P.S.: I'm also interested in links to articles and blogs discussing the issue. As a start, here is the original article that got me thinking about it: Naming Java Classes without a 'Manager'



Update: Summary of answers

Here's a little summary of what I learned from this question in the meantime.


Try not to create new metaphors (Nanny)
Have a look at what other frameworks do

What names do you find yourself prepending/appending to classes regularly?

Reader
Handler
Container
Protocol
Target
Converter
Controller
View
Factory

Bucket


And a good tip for the road:

835,153724,"How to round a number to n decimal places in Java

What I would like is a method to convert a double to a string which rounds using the half-up method - i.e. if the decimal to be rounded is 5, it always rounds up to the next number. This is the standard method of rounding most people expect in most situations.

I also would like only significant digits to be displayed - i.e. there should not be any trailing zeroes.

I know one method of doing this is to use the String.format method:

String.format(""%.5g%n"", 0.912385);


returns:

0.91239


which is great, however it always displays numbers with 5 decimal places even if they are not significant: 

String.format(""%.5g%n"", 0.912300);


returns:

0.91230


Another method is to use the DecimalFormatter:

DecimalFormat df = new DecimalFormat(""#.#####"");
df.format(0.912385);


returns:

0.91238


However as you can see this uses half-even rounding. That is it will round down if the previous digit is even. What I'd like is this:

0.912385 -> 0.91239
0.912300 -> 0.9123

I want to set transparency by hex color so let's say my hex color id ""#33b5e5"" and I want it to be 50% transparent. Then I'll use ""#8033b5e5"" because 80 is 50%. 

I found a useful chart here: http://www.dtp-aus.com/hexadeci.htm . With this data I managed to come up with this:

0% = #00
10% = #16
20% = #32
30% = #48
40% = #64
50% = #80

857,30727515,"Why is executing Java code in comments with certain Unicode characters allowed?

The following code produces the output ""Hello World!"" (no really, try it).

public static void main(String... args) {

   // The comment below is not a typo.
   // \u000d System.out.println(""Hello World!"");
}


The reason for this is that the Java compiler parses the Unicode character \u000d as a new line and gets transformed into:

public static void main(String... args) {

   // The comment below is not a typo.
   //
   System.out.println(""Hello World!"");
}


Thus resulting into a comment being ""executed"".

Since this can be used to ""hide"" malicious code or whatever an evil programmer can conceive, why is it allowed in comments?

  <h1>Header title</h1>

</div>




The header section is fixed height, but the header content may change.

I would like the content of the header to be vertically aligned to the bottom of the header section, so the last line of text ""sticks"" to the bottom of the header section.

So if there is only one line of text, it would be like:


-----------------------------
| Header title
|
|
|
| header content (resulting in one line)
-----------------------------


And if there were three lines:


-----------------------------
| Header title
|
| header content (which is so
| much stuff that it perfectly
| spans over three lines)
-----------------------------

880,477572,"Strange OutOfMemory issue while loading an image to a Bitmap object

I have a ListView with a couple of image buttons on each row. When the user clicks the list row, it launches a new activity. I have had to build my own tabs because of an issue with the camera layout. The activity that gets launched for the result is a map. If I click on my button to launch the image preview (load an image off the SD card) the application returns from the activity back to the ListView activity to the result handler to relaunch my new activity which is nothing more than an image widget.
The image preview on the ListView is being done with the cursor and ListAdapter. This makes it pretty simple, but I am not sure how I can put a resized image (I.e. Smaller bit size not pixel as the src for the image button on the fly. So I just resized the image that came off the phone camera.
The issue is that I get an OutOfMemoryError when it tries to go back and re-launch the 2nd activity.

Is there a way I can build the list adapter easily row by row, where I can resize on the fly (bitwise)?

This would be preferable as I also need to make some changes to the properties of the widgets/elements in each row as I am unable to select a row with the touch screen because of the focus issue. (I can use rollerball.)

I know I can do an out of band resize and save my image, but that is not really what I want to do, but some sample code for that would be nice.

As soon as I disabled the image on the ListView it worked fine again.
FYI: This is how I was doing it:
String[] from = new String[] { DBHelper.KEY_BUSINESSNAME, DBHelper.KEY_ADDRESS,
    DBHelper.KEY_CITY, DBHelper.KEY_GPSLONG, DBHelper.KEY_GPSLAT,
    DBHelper.KEY_IMAGEFILENAME  + """"};
int[] to = new int[] { R.id.businessname, R.id.address, R.id.city, R.id.gpslong,
    R.id.gpslat, R.id.imagefilename };
notes = new SimpleCursorAdapter(this, R.layout.notes_row, c, from, to);
setListAdapter(notes);

Where R.id.imagefilename is a ButtonImage.

I'm trying to find the proper way to define some components which could be used in a generic way:

<Parent>
  <Child value=""1"">
  <Child value=""2"">

There is a logic going on for rendering between parent and children components of course, you can imagine <select> and <option> as an example of this logic.

This is a dummy implementation for the purpose of the question:

var Parent = React.createClass({
  doSomething: function(value) {
  },
  render: function() {
    return (<div>{this.props.children}</div>);
  }
});

var Child = React.createClass({

    this.props.doSomething(this.props.value); // doSomething is undefined
  },
  render: function() {
    return (<div onClick={this.onClick}></div>);

Since MySQL doesn't seem to have any 'boolean' data type, which data type do you 'abuse' for storing true/false information in MySQL?

tinyint, varchar fields containing the values 0/1,
varchar fields containing the strings '0'/'1' or 'true'/'false'
and finally enum Fields containing the two options 'true'/'false'.


None of the above seems optimal. I tend to prefer the tinyint 0/1 variant, since automatic type conversion in PHP gives me boolean values rather simply.

As I continue to build more and more websites and web applications I am often asked to store user's passwords in a way that they can be retrieved if/when the user has an issue (either to email a forgotten password link, walk them through over the phone, etc.)  When I can I fight bitterly against this practice and I do a lot of ‘extra’ programming to make password resets and administrative assistance possible without storing their actual password.

When I can’t fight it (or can’t win) then I always encode the password in some way so that it, at least, isn’t stored as plaintext in the database—though I am aware that if my DB gets hacked it wouldn't take much for the culprit to crack the passwords, so that makes me uncomfortable.

In a perfect world folks would update passwords frequently and not duplicate them across many different sites—unfortunately I know MANY people that have the same work/home/email/bank password, and have even freely given it to me when they need assistance.  I don’t want to be the one responsible for their financial demise if my DB security procedures fail for some reason.

Morally and ethically I feel responsible for protecting what can be, for some users, their livelihood even if they are treating it with much less respect.
I am certain that there are many avenues to approach and arguments to be made for salting hashes and different encoding options, but is there a single ‘best practice’ when you have to store them?  In almost all cases I am using PHP and MySQL if that makes any difference in the way I should handle the specifics.

Additional Information for Bounty

I want to clarify that I know this is not something you want to have to do and that in most cases refusal to do so is best.  I am, however, not looking for a lecture on the merits of taking this approach I am looking for the best steps to take if you do take this approach.

In a note below I made the point that websites geared largely toward the elderly, mentally challenged, or very young can become confusing for people when they are asked to perform a secure password recovery routine.  Though we may find it simple and mundane in those cases some users need the extra assistance of either having a service tech help them into the system or having it emailed/displayed directly to them.  

In such systems the attrition rate from these demographics could hobble the application if users were not given this level of access assistance, so please answer with such a setup in mind.

Thanks to Everyone

This has been a fun question with lots of debate and I have enjoyed it.  In the end I selected an answer that both retains password security (I will not have to keep plain text or recoverable passwords), but also makes it possible for the user base I specified to log into a system without the major drawbacks I have found from normal password recovery.

As always there were about 5 answers that I would like to have marked as correct for different reasons, but I had to choose the best one--all the rest got a +1.  Thanks everyone!

In templates, where and why do I have to put typename and template on dependent names?
What exactly are dependent names anyway?  

I have the following code:

template <typename T, typename Tail> // Tail will be a UnionNode too.
struct UnionNode : public Tail {
    // ...
    template<typename U> struct inUnion {
        // Q: where to add typename/template here?

Anytime I have to re-import my projects into Eclipse (if I reinstalled Eclipse, or changed the location of the projects), almost all of my overridden methods are not formatted correctly, causing the error:


  The method must override a superclass method


It may be noteworthy to mention this is with Android projects for whatever reason, the method argument values are not always populated, so I have to manually populate them myself. For instance:

list.setOnCreateContextMenuListener(new OnCreateContextMenuListener() {

    //These arguments have their correct names
    public void onCreateContextMenu(ContextMenu menu, View v, 
                                    ContextMenuInfo menuInfo) {                 
    }

});


will be initially populated like this:

list.setOnCreateContextMenuListener(new OnCreateContextMenuListener() {

});

This becomes quite a pain having to manually recreate ALL my overridden methods by hand. If anyone can explain why this happens or how to fix it. I would be very happy.

Maybe it is due to the way I am formatting the methods, which are inside an argument of another method?

1021,3492302,"Easy interview question got harder: given numbers 1..100, find the missing number(s) given exactly k are missing

I had an interesting job interview experience a while back. The question started really easy:

Q1: We have a bag containing numbers 1, 2, 3, …, 100. Each number appears exactly once, so there are 100 numbers. Now one number is randomly picked out of the bag. Find the missing number.

I've heard this interview question before, of course, so I very quickly answered along the lines of:

A1: Well, the sum of the numbers 1 + 2 + 3 + … + N is (N+1)(N/2) (see Wikipedia: sum of arithmetic series). For N = 100, the sum is 5050.
Thus, if all numbers are present in the bag, the sum will be exactly 5050. Since one number is missing, the sum will be less than this, and the difference is that number. So we can find that missing number in O(N) time and O(1) space.

At this point I thought I had done well, but all of a sudden the question took an unexpected turn:

Q2: That is correct, but now how would you do this if TWO numbers are missing?

I had never seen/heard/considered this variation before, so I panicked and couldn't answer the question. The interviewer insisted on knowing my thought process, so I mentioned that perhaps we can get more information by comparing against the expected product, or perhaps doing a second pass after having gathered some information from the first pass, etc, but I really was just shooting in the dark rather than actually having a clear path to the solution.
The interviewer did try to encourage me by saying that having a second equation is indeed one way to solve the problem. At this point I was kind of upset (for not knowing the answer before hand), and asked if this is a general (read: ""useful"") programming technique, or if it's just a trick/gotcha answer.
The interviewer's answer surprised me: you can generalize the technique to find 3 missing numbers. In fact, you can generalize it to find k missing numbers.

Qk: If exactly k numbers are missing from the bag, how would you find it efficiently?

This was a few months ago, and I still couldn't figure out what this technique is.  Obviously there's a Ω(N) time lower bound since we must scan all the numbers at least once, but the interviewer insisted that the TIME and SPACE complexity of the solving technique (minus the O(N) time input scan) is defined in k not N.
So the question here is simple:

How would you solve Q2?
How would you solve Q3?
How would you solve Qk?


Clarifications

Generally there are N numbers from 1..N, not just 1..100.
I'm not looking for the obvious set-based solution, e.g. using a bit set, encoding the presence/absence each number by the value of a designated bit, therefore using O(N) bits in additional space. We can't afford any additional space proportional to N.
I'm also not looking for the obvious sort-first approach. This and the set-based approach are worth mentioning in an interview (they are easy to implement, and depending on N, can be very practical). I'm looking for the Holy Grail solution (which may or may not be practical to implement, but has the desired asymptotic characteristics nevertheless).

So again, of course you must scan the input in O(N), but you can only capture small amount of information (defined in terms of k not N), and must then find the k missing numbers somehow.

I have a limited exposure to DB and have only used DB as an application programmer. I want to know about Clustered and Non clustered indexes.

  A clustered index is a special type of index that reorders  the way
  records in the table are physically
  stored.  Therefore table can have only
  one clustered index. The leaf  nodes
  of a clustered index contain the data
  pages. A nonclustered index is a
  special type of index in which  the
  logical order of the index does not
  match the physical  stored order of
  the rows on disk. The leaf node of a 
  nonclustered index does not consist of
  the data pages.  Instead, the leaf

1040,8939977,"Git push rejected after feature branch rebase

OK, I thought this was a simple git scenario, what am I missing?

I have a master branch and a feature branch. I do some work on master, some on feature, and then some more on master. I end up with something like this (lexicographic order implies the order of commits):

A--B--C------F--G  (master)
       \    
        D--E  (feature)


I have no problem to git push origin master to keep the remote master updated, nor with git push origin feature (when on feature) to maintain a remote backup for my feature work. Up until now, we're good.

But now I want to rebase feature on top of the F--G commits on master, so I git checkout feature and git rebase master. Still good. Now we have:

A--B--C------F--G  (master)
                 \
                  D'--E'  (feature)


Problem: the moment I want to backup the new rebased feature branched with git push origin feature, the push is rejected since the tree has changed due to the rebasing. This can only be solved with git push --force origin feature.

I hate using --force without being sure I need it. So, do I need it? Does the rebasing necessarily imply that the next push should be --forceful?

This feature branch is not shared with any other devs, so I have no problem de facto with the force push, I'm not going to lose any data, the question is more conceptual.

Apparently, you cannot quit an application in Android (but the Android system can very well totally destroy your app whenever it feels like it). What's up with that?

1093,886221,"Does Django scale?

I'm building a web application with Django. The reasons I chose Django were:


I wanted to work with free/open-source tools.
I like Python and feel it's a long-term language, whereas regarding Ruby I wasn't sure, and PHP seemed like a huge hassle to learn.
I'm building a prototype for an idea and wasn't thinking too much about the future. Development speed was the main factor, and I already knew Python.
I knew the migration to Google App Engine would be easier should I choose to do so in the future.
I heard Django was ""nice"".


Now that I'm getting closer to thinking about publishing my work, I start being concerned about scale. The only information I found about the scaling capabilities of Django is provided by the Django team (I'm not saying anything to disregard them, but this is clearly not objective information...).

My questions:

Whenever I want to do something ""map""py in R, I usually try to use a function in the apply family.

Can someone explain how to use which one when?

My current (probably incorrect/incomplete) understanding is...


sapply(vec, f): input is a vector. output is a vector/matrix, where element i is f(vec[i]), giving you a matrix if f has a multi-element output
lapply(vec, f): same as sapply, but output is a list?
apply(matrix, 1/2, f): input is a matrix. output is a vector, where element i is f(row/col i of the matrix)
tapply(vector, grouping, f): output is a matrix/array, where an element in the matrix/array is the value of f at a grouping g of the vector, and g gets pushed to the row/col names
by(dataframe, grouping, f): let g be a grouping. apply f to each column of the group/dataframe. pretty print the grouping and the value of f at each column.
aggregate(matrix, grouping, f): similar to by, but instead of pretty printing the output, aggregate sticks everything into a dataframe.

Since I started learning F# and OCaml last year, I've read a huge number of articles which insist that design patterns (especially in Java) are workarounds for the missing features in imperative languages. One article I found makes a fairly strong claim:


  Most people I've met have read 
  the Design Patterns book by the Gang of
  Four (GoF). Any self respecting programmer
  will tell you that the book is
  language agnostic and the patterns
  apply to software engineering in
  general, regardless of which language
  you use. This is a noble claim.
  Unfortunately it is far removed from
  the truth.
  
  Functional languages are extremely
  expressive. In a functional language
  one does not need design patterns
  because the language is likely so high
  level, you end up programming in
  concepts that eliminate design
  patterns all together.


The main features of functional programming (FP) include functions as first-class values, currying, immutable values, etc. It doesn't seem obvious to me that OO design patterns are approximating any of those features.

Additionally, in functional languages which support OOP (such as F# and OCaml), it seems obvious to me that programmers using these languages would use the same design patterns found available to every other OOP language. In fact, right now I use F# and OCaml every day, and there are no striking differences between the patterns I use in these languages vs. the patterns I use when I write in Java.

Is there any truth to the claim that functional programming eliminates the need for OOP design patterns? If so, could you post or link to an example of a typical OOP design pattern and its functional equivalent?

1130,28459418,"Use of PUT vs PATCH methods in REST API real life scenarios

First of all, some definitions:
PUT is defined in Section 9.6 RFC 2616:

The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers to an already existing resource, the enclosed entity SHOULD be considered as a modified version of the one residing on the origin server. If the Request-URI does not point to an existing resource, and that URI is capable of being defined as a new resource by the requesting user agent, the origin server can create the resource with that URI.

PATCH is defined in RFC 5789:

The PATCH method requests that a set of changes described in the
request entity be applied to the resource identified by the Request-
URI.

Also according to RFC 2616 Section 9.1.2 PUT is Idempotent while PATCH is not.
Now let us take a look at a real example. When I do POST to /users with the data {username: 'skwee357', email: 'skwee357@domain.example'} and the server is capable of creating a resource, it will respond with 201 and resource location (lets assume /users/1) and any next call to GET /users/1 will return {id: 1, username: 'skwee357', email: 'skwee357@domain.example'}.
Now let us say I want to modify my email. Email modification is considered ""a set of changes"" and therefore I should PATCH /users/1 with ""patch document"". In my case it would be the JSON document: {email: 'skwee357@newdomain.example'}. The server then returns 200 (assuming permission are ok). This brings me to first question:

PATCH is NOT idempotent. It said so in RFC 2616 and RFC 5789. However if I issue the same PATCH request (with my new email), I will get the same resource state (with my email being modified to the requested value). Why is PATCH not then idempotent?

PATCH is a relatively new verb (RFC introduced in March 2010), and it comes to solve the problem of ""patching"" or modifying a set of fields. Before PATCH was introduced, everybody used PUT to update resources. But after PATCH was introduced, it leaves me confused about what PUT is used for. And this brings me to my second (and the main) question:

What is the real difference between PUT and PATCH? I have read somewhere that PUT might be used to replace entire entity under specific resource, so one should send the full entity (instead of set of attributes as with PATCH). What is the real practical usage for such case? When would you like to replace / overwrite an entity at a specific resource URI and why is such an operation not considered updating / patching the entity? The only practical use case I see for PUT is issuing a PUT on a collection, i.e. /users to replace the entire collection. Issuing PUT on a specific entity makes no sense after PATCH was introduced. Am I wrong?

1132,2734270,"How to make links in a TextView clickable

I have the following TextView defined:
<TextView

    android:autoLink=""web"" android:id=""@+id/infoTxtCredits""

Android is highlighting the links in the TextView, but they do not respond to clicks. What am I doing wrong?  Do I have to set an onClickListener for the TextView in my activity for something as simple as this?

<string name=""txtCredits"">www.google.com</string>

a. Create a separate HTTP server for each website that needs it. Then load all JavaScript code at the start of the program, so the code is interpreted once.

b. Create one single Node.js server which handles all Node.js requests. This reads the requested files and evals their contents. So the files are interpreted on each request, but the server logic is much simpler.

1144,1218390,"What is your most productive shortcut with Vim?

I've heard a lot about Vim, both pros and cons.
It really seems you should be (as a developer) faster with Vim than with any other editor.
I'm using Vim to do some basic stuff and I'm at best 10 times less productive with Vim.

The only two things you should care about when you talk about speed (you may not care enough about them, but you should) are:


Using alternatively left and right
hands is the fastest way to use the
keyboard. 
Never touching the mouse is the
second way to be as fast as possible.
It takes ages for you to move your hand,
grab the mouse, move it, and bring it
back to the keyboard (and you often have
to look at the keyboard to be sure you
returned your hand properly to the right place)


Here are two examples demonstrating why I'm far less productive with Vim.

Copy/Cut & paste. I do it all the time. With all the contemporary editors you press Shift  with the left hand, and you move the cursor with your right hand to select text. Then Ctrl+C copies, you move the cursor and Ctrl+V pastes.

With Vim it's horrible:


yy to copy one line (you almost never want the whole line!)
[number xx]yy to copy xx lines into the buffer. But you never know exactly if you've selected what you wanted. I often have to do [number xx]dd then u to undo!


Another example? Search & replace.


In PSPad: Ctrl+f then type what you want you search for, then press Enter.
In Vim: /, then type what you want to search for, then if there are some special characters put \ before each special character, then press Enter.


And everything with Vim is like that: it seems I don't know how to handle it the right way.

NB : I've already read the Vim cheat sheet :)

My question is:

What is the way you use Vim that makes you more productive than with a contemporary editor?

1145,32461229,"Why use Redux over Facebook Flux?

I've read this answer, reducing boilerplate, looked at few GitHub examples and even tried redux a little bit (todo apps). 

As I understand, official redux doc motivations provide pros comparing to traditional MVC architectures. BUT it doesn't provide an answer to the question: 

Why you should use Redux over Facebook Flux? 

Is that only a question of programming styles: functional vs non-functional? Or the question is in abilities/dev-tools that follow from redux approach? Maybe scaling? Or testing?

Am I right if I say that redux is a flux for people who come from functional languages? 

To answer this question you may compare the complexity of implementation redux's motivation points on flux vs redux.

Here are motivation points from official redux doc motivations:


Handling optimistic updates (as I understand, it hardly depends on 5th point. Is it hard to implement it in facebook flux?)
Rendering on the server (facebook flux also can do this. Any benefits comparing to redux?)
Fetching data before performing route transitions (Why it can't be achieved in facebook flux? What's the benefits?)
Hot reload (It's possible with React Hot Reload. Why do we need redux?)
Undo/Redo functionality
Any other points? Like persisting state...

1223,36795819,"When should I use curly braces for ES6 import?

It seems to be obvious, but I found myself a bit confused about when to use curly braces for importing a single module in ES6. For example, in the React-Native project I am working on, I have the following file and its content:
File initialState.js
var initialState = {
    todo: {
        todos: [
            {id: 1, task: 'Finish Coding', completed: false},
            {id: 2, task: 'Do Laundry', completed: false},
            {id: 2, task: 'Shopping Groceries', completed: false},
        ]
    }
};

export default initialState;

In the TodoReducer.js, I have to import it without curly braces:
import initialState from './todoInitialState';

If I enclose the initialState in curly braces, I get the following error for the following line of code:

Cannot read property todo of undefined

File TodoReducer.js:
export default function todos(state = initialState.todo, action) {
    // ...
}

Similar errors also happen to my components with the curly braces. I was wondering when I should use curly braces for a single import, because obviously, when importing multiple component/modules, you have to enclose them in curly braces, which I know.
The Stack Overflow post at here does not answer my question, instead I am asking when I should or should not use curly braces for importing a single module, or I should never use curly braces for importing a single module in ES6 (this is apparently not the case, as I have seen single import with curly braces required).

I am wondering when to use static methods? Say if I have a class with a few getters and setters, a method or two, and I want those methods only to be invokable on an instance object of the class. Does this mean I should use a static method?
Example:
Obj x = new Obj();
x.someMethod();

...or:
Obj.someMethod(); // Is this the static way?

I'm rather confused!

1277,743164,"How to emulate a do-while loop?

I need to emulate a do-while loop in a Python program. Unfortunately, the following straightforward code does not work:

list_of_ints = [ 1, 2, 3 ]
iterator = list_of_ints.__iter__()
element = None

while True:
  if element:
    print element

  try:
    element = iterator.next()
  except StopIteration:
    break

print ""done""


Instead of ""1,2,3,done"", it prints the following output:

[stdout:]1
[stdout:]2
[stdout:]3
None['Traceback (most recent call last):
', '  File ""test_python.py"", line 8, in <module>
    s = i.next()
', 'StopIteration
']


What can I do in order to catch the 'stop iteration' exception and break a while
loop properly?

1286,779379,"Why is setTimeout(fn, 0) sometimes useful?

I've recently run into a rather nasty bug, wherein the code was loading a <select> dynamically via JavaScript.  This dynamically loaded <select> had a pre-selected value.  In IE6, we already had code to fix the selected <option>, because sometimes the <select>'s selectedIndex value would be out of sync with the selected <option>'s index attribute, as below:

field.selectedIndex = element.index;


However, this code wasn't working.  Even though the field's selectedIndex was being set correctly, the wrong index would end up being selected.  However, if I stuck an alert() statement in at the right time, the correct option would be selected.  Thinking this might be some sort of timing issue, I tried something random that I'd seen in code before:

var wrapFn = (function() {
    var myField = field;
    var myElement = element;

    return function() {
        myField.selectedIndex = myElement.index;
    }
})();
setTimeout(wrapFn, 0);


And this worked!

I've got a solution for my problem, but I'm uneasy that I don't know exactly why this fixes my problem.  Does anyone have an official explanation?  What browser issue am I avoiding by calling my function ""later"" using setTimeout()?

1288,11605917,"'this' vs $scope in AngularJS controllers

In the ""Create Components"" section of AngularJS's homepage, there is this example:

controller: function($scope, $element) {
  var panes = $scope.panes = [];
  $scope.select = function(pane) {
    angular.forEach(panes, function(pane) {
      pane.selected = false;

  }
  this.addPane = function(pane) {
    if (panes.length == 0) $scope.select(pane);
    panes.push(pane);
  }
}


Notice how the select method is added to $scope, but the addPane method is added to this. If I change it to $scope.addPane, the code breaks.

The documentation says that there in fact is a difference, but it doesn't mention what the difference is:


  Previous versions of Angular (pre 1.0 RC) allowed you to use this interchangeably with the $scope method, but this is no longer the case. Inside of methods defined on the scope this and $scope are interchangeable (angular sets this to $scope), but not otherwise inside your controller constructor.

If it has, the script prints the message ""MyApplicationName is just installed"" and ends (return 1 mean that ends with an “error”, doesn’t it?).

If the user is asking the Debian/Ubuntu package system to install my package, the script also deletes two directories.

1340,457927,"Git workflow and rebase vs merge questions

I've been using Git now for a couple of months on a project with one other developer. I have several years of experience with SVN, so I guess I bring a lot of baggage to the relationship.

I have heard that Git is excellent for branching and merging, and so far, I just don't see it. Sure, branching is dead simple, but when I try to merge, everything goes all to hell. Now, I'm used to that from SVN, but it seems to me that I just traded one sub-par versioning system for another.

My partner tells me that my problems stem from my desire to merge willy-nilly, and that I should be using rebase instead of merge in many situations. For example, here's the workflow that he's laid down:

clone the remote repository
git checkout -b my_new_feature
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..finish the feature
git checkout master
git merge my_new_feature


Essentially, create a feature branch, ALWAYS rebase from master to the branch, and merge from the branch back to master. Important to note is that the branch always stays local.

Here is the workflow that I started with

clone remote repository
create my_new_feature branch on remote repository
git checkout -b --track my_new_feature origin/my_new_feature
..work, commit, push to origin/my_new_feature
git merge master (to get some changes that my partner added)
..work, commit, push to origin/my_new_feature
git merge master
..finish my_new_feature, push to origin/my_new_feature
git checkout master
git merge my_new_feature
delete remote branch
delete local branch


There are two essential differences (I think): I use merge always instead of rebasing, and I push my feature branch (and my feature branch commits) to the remote repository.

My reasoning for the remote branch is that I want my work backed up as I'm working. Our repository is automatically backed up and can be restored if something goes wrong. My laptop is not, or not as thoroughly. Therefore, I hate to have code on my laptop that's not mirrored somewhere else.

My reasoning for the merge instead of rebase is that merge seems to be standard and rebase seems to be an advanced feature. My gut feeling is that what I'm trying to do is not an advanced setup, so rebase should be unnecessary. I've even perused the new Pragmatic Programming book on Git, and they cover merge extensively and barely mention rebase.

Anyway, I was following my workflow on a recent branch, and when I tried to merge it back to master, it all went to hell. There were tons of conflicts with things that should have not mattered. The conflicts just made no sense to me. It took me a day to sort everything out, and eventually culminated in a forced push to the remote master, since my local master has all conflicts resolved, but the remote one still wasn't happy.

What is the ""correct"" workflow for something like this? Git is supposed to make branching and merging super-easy, and I'm just not seeing it.

Update 2011-04-15

This seems to be a very popular question, so I thought I'd update with my two years experience since I first asked.

It turns out that the original workflow is correct, at least in our case. In other words, this is what we do and it works:

clone the remote repository
git checkout -b my_new_feature
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..finish the feature, commit
git rebase master
git checkout master
git merge my_new_feature


In fact, our workflow is a little different, as we tend to do squash merges instead of raw merges. (Note: This is controversial, see below.) This allows us to turn our entire feature branch into a single commit on master. Then we delete our feature branch. This allows us to logically structure our commits on master, even if they're a little messy on our branches. So, this is what we do:

clone the remote repository
git checkout -b my_new_feature
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..finish the feature, commit
git rebase master
git checkout master
git merge --squash my_new_feature
git commit -m ""added my_new_feature""
git branch -D my_new_feature


Squash Merge Controversy - As several commenters have pointed out, the squash merge will throw away all history on your feature branch. As the name implies, it squashes all the commits down into a single one. For small features, this makes sense as it condenses it down into a single package. For larger features, it's probably not a great idea, especially if your individual commits are already atomic. It really comes down to personal preference.

Github and Bitbucket (others?) Pull Requests - In case you're wondering how merge/rebase relates to Pull Requests, I recommend following all the above steps up until you're ready to merge back to master. Instead of manually merging with git, you just accept the PR. Note that this will not do a squash merge (at least not by default), but non-squash, non-fast-forward is the accepted merge convention in the Pull Request community (as far as I know). Specifically, it works like this:

clone the remote repository
git checkout -b my_new_feature
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..finish the feature, commit
git rebase master
git push # May need to force push
...submit PR, wait for a review, make any changes requested for the PR
git rebase master
git push # Will probably need to force push (-f), due to previous rebases from master
...accept the PR, most likely also deleting the feature branch in the process
git checkout master
git branch -d my_new_feature
git remote prune origin


I've come to love Git and never want to go back to SVN. If you're struggling, just stick with it and eventually you'll see the light at the end of the tunnel.

1341,11032015,"How can I find the time complexity of an algorithm?

I have gone through Google and Stack Overflow search, but nowhere I was able to find a clear and straightforward explanation for how to calculate time complexity.
What do I know already?
Say for code as simple as the one below:
char h = 'y'; // This will be executed 1 time
int abc = 0; // This will be executed 1 time

Say for a loop like the one below:
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    Console.Write('Hello, World!!');
}


int i=0; This will be executed only once.

The time is actually calculated to i=0 and not the declaration.

i < N; This will be executed N+1 times
i++ This will be executed N times

So the number of operations required by this loop are {1+(N+1)+N} = 2N+2. (But this still may be wrong, as I am not confident about my understanding.)
OK, so these small basic calculations I think I know, but in most cases I have seen the time complexity as O(N), O(n^2), O(log n), O(n!), and many others.

1342,12622424,"How do I animate constraint changes?

I'm updating an old app with an AdBannerView and when there is no ad, it slides off screen. When there is an ad it slides on the screen. Basic stuff.
Old style, I set the frame in an animation block.
New style, I have a IBOutlet to the auto-layout constraint which determines the Y position, in this case it's distance from the bottom of the superview, and modify the constant:
- (void)moveBannerOffScreen {
    [UIView animateWithDuration:5 animations:^{
        _addBannerDistanceFromBottomConstraint.constant = -32;
    }];
    bannerIsVisible = FALSE;

And the banner moves, exactly as expected, but no animation.

UPDATE: I re-watched WWDC 12 talk Best Practices for Mastering Auto Layout which covers animation. It discusses how to update constraints using CoreAnimation:


I've tried with the following code, but get the exact same results:
- (void)moveBannerOffScreen {
    _addBannerDistanceFromBottomConstraint.constant = -32;
    [UIView animateWithDuration:2 animations:^{

    [UIView animateWithDuration:2 animations:^{
        [self.view setNeedsLayout];
    }];
    bannerIsVisible = TRUE;
}

I have a directory that need to be archived with a sub directory that has a number of very large files I do not need to backup.

Not quite solutions:

The tar --exclude=PATTERN command matches the given pattern and excludes those files, but I need specific files & folders to be ignored (full file path), otherwise valid files might be excluded.

I could also use the find command to create a list of files and exclude the ones I don't want to archive and pass the list to tar, but that only works with for a small amount of files. I have tens of thousands.

I'm beginning to think the only solution is to create a file with a list of files/folders to be excluded, then use rsync with --exclude-from=file to copy all the files to a tmp directory, and then use tar to archive that directory.

Can anybody think of a better/more efficient solution?

EDIT: Charles Ma's solution works well. The big gotcha is that the --exclude='./folder' MUST be at the beginning of the tar command. Full command (cd first, so backup is relative to that directory):

cd /folder_to_backup
tar --exclude='./folder' --exclude='./upload/folder2' -zcvf /backup/filename.tgz .

1361,30626030,"Can you force a React component to rerender without calling setState?

I have an external (to the component), observable object that I want to listen for changes on. When the object is updated it emits change events, and then I want to rerender the component when any change is detected.

With a top-level React.render this has been possible, but within a component it doesn't work (which makes some sense since the render method just returns an object).

Here's a code example:

export default class MyComponent extends React.Component {

  handleButtonClick() {
    this.render();
  }

  render() {
    return (

Clicking the button internally calls this.render(), but that's not what actually causes the rendering to happen (you can see this in action because the text created by {Math.random()} doesn't change). However, if I simply call this.setState() instead of this.render(), it works fine.

So I guess my question is: do React components need to have state in order to rerender? Is there a way to force the component to update on demand without changing the state?

However, these directions can be easily interchanged with the flex-direction property.
/* main axis is horizontal, cross axis is vertical */
flex-direction: row;
flex-direction: row-reverse;

/* main axis is vertical, cross axis is horizontal */    
flex-direction: column;
flex-direction: column-reverse;

(The cross axis is always perpendicular to the main axis.)
My point in describing how the axes' work is that there doesn't seem to be anything special about either direction. Main axis, cross axis, they're both equal in terms of importance and flex-direction makes it easy to switch back and forth.
So why does the cross axis get two additional alignment properties?
Why are align-content and align-items consolidated into one property for the main axis?
Why does the main axis not get a justify-self property?

Scenarios where these properties would be useful:

placing a flex item in the corner of the flex container
#box3 { align-self: flex-end; justify-self: flex-end; }

making a group of flex items align-right (justify-content: flex-end) but have the first item align left (justify-self: flex-start)


Consider a header section with a group of nav items and a logo. With justify-self the logo could be aligned left while the nav items stay far right, and the whole thing adjusts smoothly (""flexes"") to different screen sizes.

in a row of three flex items, affix the middle item to the center of the container  (justify-content: center) and align the adjacent items to the container edges (justify-self: flex-start and justify-self: flex-end).

Note that values space-around and space-between on
justify-content property  will not keep the middle item centered about the container if the adjacent items have different widths.


#container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  background-color: lightyellow;
}
.box {
  height: 50px;
  width: 75px;
  background-color: springgreen;
}
.box1 {
  width: 100px;
}
.box3 {
  width: 200px;
}
#center {
  text-align: center;
  margin-bottom: 5px;
}
#center > span {
  background-color: aqua;
  padding: 2px;
}
<div id=""center"">
  <span>TRUE CENTER</span>
</div>

<div id=""container"">
  <div class=""box box1""></div>
  <div class=""box box2""></div>
  <div class=""box box3""></div>
</div>

<p>note that the middlebox will only be truly centered if adjacent boxes are equal width</p>



jsFiddle version

As of this writing, there is no mention of justify-self or justify-items in the flexbox spec.
However, in the CSS Box Alignment Module, which is the W3C's unfinished proposal to establish a common set of alignment properties for use across all box models, there is this:

                                                                                                                                                   Source: W3C
You'll notice that justify-self and justify-items are being considered... but not for flexbox.

I'll end by reiterating the main question:

Why are there no ""justify-items"" and ""justify-self"" properties?

1467,3684484,"Peak detection in a 2D array

I'm helping a veterinary clinic measuring pressure under a dogs paw. I use Python for my data analysis and now I'm stuck trying to divide the paws into (anatomical) subregions.
I made a 2D array of each paw, that consists of the maximal values for each sensor that has been loaded by the paw over time. Here's an example of one paw, where I used Excel to draw the areas I want to 'detect'. These are 2 by 2 boxes around the sensor with local maxima's, that together have the largest sum.

So I tried some experimenting and decide to simply look for the maximums of each column and row (can't look in one direction due to the shape of the paw). This seems to 'detect' the location of the separate toes fairly well, but it also marks neighboring sensors.

So what would be the best way to tell Python which of these maximums are the ones I want?
Note: The 2x2 squares can't overlap, since they have to be separate toes!
Also I took 2x2 as a convenience, any more advanced solution is welcome, but I'm simply a human movement scientist, so I'm neither a real programmer or a mathematician, so please keep it 'simple'.
Here's a version that can be loaded with np.loadtxt

Results
So I tried @jextee's solution (see the results below). As you can see, it works very on the front paws, but it works less well for the hind legs.
More specifically, it can't recognize the small peak that's the fourth toe. This is obviously inherent to the fact that the loop looks top down towards the lowest value, without taking into account where this is.
Would anyone know how to tweak @jextee's algorithm, so that it might be able to find the 4th toe too?

Since I haven't processed any other trials yet, I can't supply any other samples. But the data I gave before were the averages of each paw. This file is an array with the maximal data of 9 paws in the order they made contact with the plate.
This image shows how they were spatially spread out over the plate.

Update:
I have set up a blog for anyone interested and I have setup a OneDrive with all the raw measurements. So to anyone requesting more data: more power to you!

New update:
So after the help I got with my questions regarding paw detection and paw sorting, I was finally able to check the toe detection for every paw! Turns out, it doesn't work so well in anything but paws sized like the one in my own example. Off course in hindsight, it's my own fault for choosing the 2x2 so arbitrarily.
Here's a nice example of where it goes wrong: a nail is being recognized as a toe and the 'heel' is so wide, it gets recognized twice!

The paw is too large, so taking a 2x2 size with no overlap, causes some toes to be detected twice. The other way around, in small dogs it often fails to find a 5th toe, which I suspect is being caused by the 2x2 area being too large.
After trying the current solution on all my measurements I came to the staggering conclusion that for nearly all my small dogs it didn't find a 5th toe and that in over 50% of the impacts for the large dogs it would find more!
So clearly I need to change it. My own guess was changing the size of the neighborhood to something smaller for small dogs and larger for large dogs. But generate_binary_structure wouldn't let me change the size of the array.
Therefore, I'm hoping that anyone else has a better suggestion for locating the toes, perhaps having the toe area scale with the paw size?

I'm looking for an optimal way to resize wrapping text in a TextView so that it will fit within its getHeight and getWidth bounds. I'm not simply looking for a way to wrap the text- I want to make sure it both wraps and is small enough to fit entirely on the screen. 

I've seen a few cases on StackOverflow where auto resizing was needed, but they are either very special cases with hack solutions, have no solution, or involve re-drawing the TextView recursively until it is small enough (which is memory intense and forces the user to watch the text shrink step-by-step with every recursion). 

But I'm sure somebody out there has found a good solution that doesn't involve what I'm doing: writing several heavy routines that parse and measure the text, resize the text, and repeat until a suitably small size has been found.

"
1495,24101718,"Swift Beta performance: sorting arrays

I was implementing an algorithm in Swift Beta and noticed that the performance was very poor. After digging deeper I realized that one of the bottlenecks was something as simple as sorting arrays. The relevant part is here:

let n = 1000000
var x =  [Int](repeating: 0, count: n)
for i in 0..<n {
    x[i] = random()
}
// start clock here
let y = sort(x)
// stop clock here


In C++, a similar operation takes 0.06s on my computer.

In Python, it takes 0.6s (no tricks, just y = sorted(x) for a list of integers).

In Swift it takes 6s if I compile it with the following command:

xcrun swift -O3 -sdk `xcrun --show-sdk-path --sdk macosx`


And it takes as much as 88s if I compile it with the following command:

xcrun swift -O0 -sdk `xcrun --show-sdk-path --sdk macosx`


Timings in Xcode with ""Release"" vs. ""Debug"" builds are similar.

What is wrong here? I could understand some performance loss in comparison with C++, but not a 10-fold slowdown in comparison with pure Python.



Edit: weather noticed that changing -O3 to -Ofast makes this code run almost as fast as the C++ version! However, -Ofast changes the semantics of the language a lot — in my testing, it disabled the checks for integer overflows and array indexing overflows. For example, with -Ofast the following Swift code runs silently without crashing (and prints out some garbage):

let n = 10000000
print(n*n*n*n*n)
let x =  [Int](repeating: 10, count: n)
print(x[n])


So -Ofast is not what we want; the whole point of Swift is that we have the safety nets in place. Of course, the safety nets have some impact on the performance, but they should not make the programs 100 times slower. Remember that Java already checks for array bounds, and in typical cases, the slowdown is by a factor much less than 2. And in Clang and GCC we have got -ftrapv for checking (signed) integer overflows, and it is not that slow, either.

Hence the question: how can we get reasonable performance in Swift without losing the safety nets?



Edit 2: I did some more benchmarking, with very simple loops along the lines of

for i in 0..<n {
    x[i] = x[i] ^ 12345678
}


(Here the xor operation is there just so that I can more easily find the relevant loop in the assembly code. I tried to pick an operation that is easy to spot but also ""harmless"" in the sense that it should not require any checks related to integer overflows.)

Again, there was a huge difference in the performance between -O3 and -Ofast. So I had a look at the assembly code:


With -Ofast I get pretty much what I would expect. The relevant part is a loop with 5 machine language instructions.
With -O3 I get something that was beyond my wildest imagination. The inner loop spans 88 lines of assembly code. I did not try to understand all of it, but the most suspicious parts are 13 invocations of ""callq _swift_retain"" and another 13 invocations of ""callq _swift_release"". That is, 26 subroutine calls in the inner loop!




Edit 3: In comments, Ferruccio asked for benchmarks that are fair in the sense that they do not rely on built-in functions (e.g. sort). I think the following program is a fairly good example:

let n = 10000
var x = [Int](repeating: 1, count: n)
for i in 0..<n {
    for j in 0..<n {
        x[i] = x[j]
    }
}


There is no arithmetic, so we do not need to worry about integer overflows. The only thing that we do is just lots of array references. And the results are here—Swift -O3 loses by a factor almost 500 in comparison with -Ofast:


C++ -O3: 0.05 s
C++ -O0: 0.4 s
Java: 0.2 s
Python with PyPy: 0.5 s
Python: 12 s
Swift -Ofast: 0.05 s
Swift -O3: 23 s
Swift -O0: 443 s


(If you are concerned that the compiler might optimize out the pointless loops entirely, you can change it to e.g. x[i] ^= x[j], and add a print statement that outputs x[0]. This does not change anything; the timings will be very similar.)

And yes, here the Python implementation was a stupid pure Python implementation with a list of ints and nested for loops. It should be much slower than unoptimized Swift. Something seems to be seriously broken with Swift and array indexing.



Edit 4: These issues (as well as some other performance issues) seems to have been fixed in Xcode 6 beta 5.

For sorting, I now have the following timings:


clang++ -O3: 0.06 s
swiftc -Ofast: 0.1 s
swiftc -O: 0.1 s
swiftc: 4 s


For nested loops:


clang++ -O3: 0.06 s
swiftc -Ofast: 0.3 s
swiftc -O: 0.4 s
swiftc: 540 s


It seems that there is no reason anymore to use the unsafe -Ofast (a.k.a. -Ounchecked); plain -O produces equally good code.

1506,9271276,"Should CSS always precede JavaScript?

In countless places online I have seen the recommendation to include CSS prior to JavaScript. The reasoning is generally, of this form:

When it comes to ordering your CSS and JavaScript, you want your CSS
to come first. The reason is that the rendering thread has all the
style information it needs to render the page. If the JavaScript
includes come first, the JavaScript engine has to parse it all before
continuing on to the next set of resources. This means the rendering
thread can't completely show the page, since it doesn't have all the
styles it needs.

My actual testing reveals something quite different:
My test harness
I use the following Ruby script to generate specific delays for various resources:
require 'rubygems'
require 'eventmachine'
require 'evma_httpserver'
require 'date'

class Handler  < EventMachine::Connection
  include EventMachine::HttpServer

  def process_http_request
    resp = EventMachine::DelegatedHttpResponse.new( self )

    path = @http_path_info
    array = @http_query_string.split(""&"").map{|s| s.split(""="")}.flatten
    parsed = Hash[*array]

    delay = parsed[""delay""].to_i / 1000.0
    jsdelay = parsed[""jsdelay""].to_i

    delay = 5 if (delay > 5)
    jsdelay = 5000 if (jsdelay > 5000)

    delay = 0 if (delay < 0)
    jsdelay = 0 if (jsdelay < 0)

    # Block which fulfills the request
    operation = proc do
      sleep delay

      if path.match(/.js$/)
        resp.status = 200
        resp.headers[""Content-Type""] = ""text/javascript""
        resp.content = ""(function(){
            var start = new Date();
            while(new Date() - start < #{jsdelay}){}
          })();""
      end
      if path.match(/.css$/)
        resp.status = 200
        resp.headers[""Content-Type""] = ""text/css""
        resp.content = ""body {font-size: 50px;}""
      end
    end

When I include the CSS first, the page takes 1.5 seconds to render:

When I include the JavaScript first, the page takes 1.4 seconds to render:

I get similar results in Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer. In Opera, however, the ordering simply does not matter.
What appears to be happening is that the JavaScript interpreter refuses to start until all the CSS is downloaded. So, it seems that having JavaScript includes first is more efficient as the JavaScript thread gets more run time.
Am I missing something? Is the recommendation to place CSS includes prior to JavaScript includes not correct?
It is clear that we could add async or use setTimeout to free up the render thread or put the JavaScript code in the footer, or use a JavaScript loader. The point here is about ordering of essential JavaScript bits and CSS bits in the head.

More so, I don't want to modify the history really. If there was bad code, it was there in the history and can be seen. I just want it out in the working copy, and I don't mind a reverse merge commit.

svn merge -c -302 ^/trunk

I thought it should be a fairly simple operation in Git and a fairly common use case. What else is the point of atomic commits?

I have the following enumeration:

The problem however is that I need the word ""FORMS"" when I ask for AuthenticationMethod.FORMS and not the id 1.

I have found the following solution for this problem (link):

First I need to create a custom attribute called ""StringValue"":

public class StringValue : System.Attribute
{
    private readonly string _value;

    public StringValue(string value)
    {
        _value = value;
    }

    public string Value
    {
        get { return _value; }
    }

}


Then I can add this attribute to my enumerator:

public enum AuthenticationMethod
{
    [StringValue(""FORMS"")]
    FORMS = 1,
    [StringValue(""WINDOWS"")]
    WINDOWSAUTHENTICATION = 2,
    [StringValue(""SSO"")]
    SINGLESIGNON = 3
}


And of course I need something to retrieve that StringValue:

public static class StringEnum
{
    public static string GetStringValue(Enum value)
    {
        string output = null;
        Type type = value.GetType();

        //Check first in our cached results...

        //Look for our 'StringValueAttribute' 

        //in the field's custom attributes

        FieldInfo fi = type.GetField(value.ToString());
        StringValue[] attrs =
           fi.GetCustomAttributes(typeof(StringValue),
                                   false) as StringValue[];
        if (attrs.Length > 0)
        {
            output = attrs[0].Value;
        }

        return output;
    }
}


Good now I've got the tools to get a string value for an enumerator.
I can then use it like this:

string valueOfAuthenticationMethod = StringEnum.GetStringValue(AuthenticationMethod.FORMS);


Okay now all of these work like a charm but I find it a whole lot of work. I was wondering if there is a better solution for this.

I also tried something with a dictionary and static properties but that wasn't better either.

        test_antigravity.py

My question is simply What's the usual way of actually running the tests? I suspect this is obvious to everyone except me, but you can't just run python test_antigravity.py from the test directory as its import antigravity will fail as the module is not on the path.
I know I could modify PYTHONPATH and other search path related tricks, but I can't believe that's the simplest way - it's fine if you're the developer but not realistic to expect your users to use if they just want to check the tests are passing.
The other alternative is just to copy the test file into the other directory, but it seems a bit dumb and misses the point of having them in a separate directory to start with.
So, if you had just downloaded the source to my new project how would you run the unit tests? I'd prefer an answer that would let me say to my users: ""To run the unit tests do X.""

I know how I use these terms, but I'm wondering if there are accepted definitions for faking, mocking, and stubbing for unit tests?  How do you define these for your tests?  Describe situations where you might use each.

Here is how I use them:

Fake: a class that implements an interface but contains fixed data and no logic.  Simply returns ""good"" or ""bad"" data depending on the implementation.

Mock: a class that implements an interface and allows the ability to dynamically set the values to return/exceptions to throw from particular methods and provides the ability to check if particular methods have been called/not called.

Stub: Like a mock class, except that it doesn't provide the ability to verify that methods have been called/not called.

Mocks and stubs can be hand generated or generated by a mocking framework.  Fake classes are generated by hand.  I use mocks primarily to verify interactions between my class and dependent classes.  I use stubs once I have verified the interactions and am testing alternate paths through my code.  I use fake classes primarily to abstract out data dependencies or when mocks/stubs are too tedious to set up each time.

1670,2043259,"How to Join to first row

I'll use a concrete, but hypothetical, example.

Each Order normally has only one line item:

Orders:

OrderGUID   OrderNumber
=========   ============
{FFB2...}   STL-7442-1      
{3EC6...}   MPT-9931-8A


LineItems:

============   ======== ========   =================================

{1609B09...}   2        32         spurving bearing


But occasionally there will be an order with two line items:

LineItemID   Order ID    Quantity   Description
==========   ========    ========   =================================
{A58A1...}   6,784,329   5          pentametric fan
{0E9BC...}   6,784,329   5          differential girdlespring 


Normally when showing the orders to the user:



SELECT Orders.OrderNumber, LineItems.Quantity, LineItems.Description
FROM Orders
    INNER JOIN LineItems 
    ON Orders.OrderID = LineItems.OrderID


I want to show the single item on the order. But with this occasional order containing two (or more) items, the orders would appear be duplicated:

OrderNumber   Quantity   Description
===========   ========   ====================
STL-7442-1    7          prefabulated amulite
MPT-9931-8A   32         spurving bearing
KSG-0619-81   5          panametric fan
KSG-0619-81   5          differential girdlespring


What I really want is to have SQL Server just pick one, as it will be good enough:

OrderNumber   Quantity   Description
===========   ========   ====================
STL-7442-1    7          prefabulated amulite
MPT-9931-8A   32         differential girdlespring
KSG-0619-81   5          panametric fan


If I get adventurous, I might show the user, an ellipsis to indicate that there's more than one:

OrderNumber   Quantity   Description
===========   ========   ====================
STL-7442-1    7          prefabulated amulite
MPT-9931-8A   32         differential girdlespring
KSG-0619-81   5          panametric fan, ...


So the question is how to either


eliminate ""duplicate"" rows
only join to one of the rows, to avoid duplication


First attempt

My first naive attempt was to only join to the ""TOP 1"" line items:

SELECT Orders.OrderNumber, LineItems.Quantity, LineItems.Description
FROM Orders
    INNER JOIN (
       SELECT TOP 1 LineItems.Quantity, LineItems.Description
       FROM LineItems
       WHERE LineItems.OrderID = Orders.OrderID) LineItems2
    ON 1=1


But that gives the error:


  The column or prefix 'Orders' does not
  match with a table name or alias name
  used in the query.  


Presumably because the inner select doesn't see the outer table.

1714,4774054,"Reliable way for a Bash script to get the full path to itself

I have a Bash script that needs to know its full path. I'm trying to find a broadly-compatible way of doing that without ending up with relative or funky-looking paths. I only need to support Bash, not sh, csh, etc.

What I've found so far:


The accepted answer to Getting the source directory of a Bash script from within addresses getting the path of the script via dirname $0, which is fine, but that may return a relative path (like .), which is a problem if you want to change directories in the script and have the path still point to the script's directory. Still, dirname will be part of the puzzle.
The accepted answer to Bash script absolute path with OS X (OS X specific, but the answer works regardless) gives a function that will test to see if $0 looks relative and if so will pre-pend $PWD to it. But the result can still have relative bits in it (although overall it's absolute) — for instance, if the script is t in the directory /usr/bin and you're in /usr and you type bin/../bin/t to run it (yes, that's convoluted), you end up with /usr/bin/../bin as the script's directory path. Which works, but...
The readlink solution on this page, which looks like this:

# Absolute path to this script. /home/user/bin/foo.sh
SCRIPT=$(readlink -f $0)
# Absolute path this script is in. /home/user/bin
SCRIPTPATH=`dirname $SCRIPT`


But readlink isn't POSIX and apparently the solution relies on GNU's readlink where BSD's won't work for some reason (I don't have access to a BSD-like system to check).


So, various ways of doing it, but they all have their caveats.

What would be a better way? Where ""better"" means:


Gives me the absolute path.
Takes out funky bits even when invoked in a convoluted way (see comment on #2 above). (E.g., at least moderately canonicalizes the path.)
Relies only on Bash-isms or things that are almost certain to be on most popular flavors of *nix systems (GNU/Linux, BSD and BSD-like systems like OS X, etc.).
Avoids calling external programs if possible (e.g., prefers Bash built-ins).
(Updated, thanks for the heads up, wich) It doesn't have to resolve symlinks (in fact, I'd kind of prefer it left them alone, but that's not a requirement).

I know there are the --exclude=PATTERN and --include=PATTERN options, but what is the pattern format? The man page of grep says:
--include=PATTERN     Recurse in directories only searching file matching PATTERN.
--exclude=PATTERN     Recurse in directories skip file matching PATTERN.

Searching on grep include, grep include exclude, grep exclude and variants did not find anything relevant
If there's a better way of grepping only in certain files, I'm all for it; moving the offending files is not an option. I can't search only certain directories (the directory structure is a big mess, with everything everywhere).

1729,924285,"Efficiency of Java ""Double Brace Initialization""?

In Hidden Features of Java the top answer mentions Double Brace Initialization, with a very enticing syntax:

Set<String> flavors = new HashSet<String>() {{
    add(""vanilla"");
    add(""strawberry"");
    add(""chocolate"");
    add(""butter pecan"");
}};


This idiom creates an anonymous inner class with just an instance initializer in it, which ""can use any [...] methods in the containing scope"".  

Main question: Is this as inefficient as it sounds?  Should its use be limited to one-off initializations?  (And of course showing off!)

Second question: The new HashSet must be the ""this"" used in the instance initializer ... can anyone shed light on the mechanism?  

Third question: Is this idiom too obscure to use in production code?

Summary: Very, very nice answers, thanks everyone. On question (3), people felt the syntax should be clear (though I'd recommend an occasional comment, especially if your code will pass on to developers who may not be familiar with it).  

On question (1), the generated code should run quickly. The extra .class files do cause jar file clutter, and slow program startup slightly (thanks to @coobird for measuring that). @Thilo pointed out that garbage collection can be affected, and the memory cost for the extra loaded classes may be a factor in some cases.  

Question (2) turned out to be most interesting to me. If I understand the answers, what's happening in DBI is that the anonymous inner class extends the class of the object being constructed by the new operator, and hence has a ""this"" value referencing the instance being constructed. Very neat.

Overall, DBI strikes me as something of an intellectual curiousity.  Coobird and others point out you can achieve the same effect with Arrays.asList, varargs methods, Google Collections, and the proposed Java 7 Collection literals.  Newer JVM languages like Scala, JRuby, and Groovy also offer concise notations for list construction, and interoperate well with Java.  Given that DBI clutters up the classpath, slows down class loading a bit, and makes the code a tad more obscure, I'd probably shy away from it. However, I plan to spring this on a friend who's just gotten his SCJP and loves good natured jousts about Java semantics!  ;-)  Thanks everyone!

7/2017: Baeldung has a good summary of double brace initialization and considers it an anti-pattern.

12/2017: @Basil Bourque notes that in the new Java 9 you can say:

Set<String> flavors = Set.of(""vanilla"", ""strawberry"", ""chocolate"", ""butter pecan"");


That's for sure the way to go.  If you're stuck with an earlier version, take a look at Google Collections' ImmutableSet.

I have been exploring different methods of editing/updating a record within Entity Framework 5 in an ASP.NET MVC3 environment, but so far none of them tick all of the boxes I need. I'll explain why.

I have found three methods to which I'll mention the pros and cons:

Method 1 - Load original record, update each property

var original = db.Users.Find(updatedUser.UserId);

if (original != null)
{
    original.BusinessEntityId = updatedUser.BusinessEntityId;
    original.Email = updatedUser.Email;
    original.EmployeeId = updatedUser.EmployeeId;
    original.Forename = updatedUser.Forename;
    original.Surname = updatedUser.Surname;
    original.Telephone = updatedUser.Telephone;
    original.Title = updatedUser.Title;
    original.Fax = updatedUser.Fax;
    original.ASPNetUserId = updatedUser.ASPNetUserId;
    db.SaveChanges();
}    


Pros


Can specify which properties change
Views don't need to contain every property


Cons


2 x queries on database to load original then update it


Method 2 - Load original record, set changed values

var original = db.Users.Find(updatedUser.UserId);

if (original != null)
{
    db.Entry(original).CurrentValues.SetValues(updatedUser);
    db.SaveChanges();
}


Pros


Only modified properties are sent to database


Cons


Views need to contain every property
2 x queries on database to load original then update it


Method 3 - Attach updated record and set state to EntityState.Modified

db.Users.Attach(updatedUser);
db.Entry(updatedUser).State = EntityState.Modified;
db.SaveChanges();


Pros


1 x query on database to update


Cons


Can't specify which properties change
Views must contain every property

1768,21435339,"data.table vs dplyr: can one do something well the other can't or does poorly?

Overview

I'm relatively familiar with data.table, not so much with dplyr.  I've read through some dplyr vignettes and examples that have popped up on SO, and so far my conclusions are that:


data.table and dplyr are comparable in speed, except when there are many (i.e. >10-100K) groups, and in some other circumstances (see benchmarks below)
dplyr has more accessible syntax
dplyr abstracts (or will) potential DB interactions
There are some minor functionality differences (see ""Examples/Usage"" below)


In my mind 2. doesn't bear much weight because I am fairly familiar with it data.table, though I understand that for users new to both it will be a big factor.  I would like to avoid an argument about which is more intuitive, as that is irrelevant for my specific question asked from the perspective of someone already familiar with data.table.  I also would like to avoid a discussion about how ""more intuitive"" leads to faster analysis (certainly true, but again, not what I'm most interested about here).

Question

What I want to know is:


Are there analytical tasks that are a lot easier to code with one or the other package for people familiar with the packages (i.e. some combination of keystrokes required vs. required level of esotericism, where less of each is a good thing).
Are there analytical tasks that are performed substantially (i.e. more than 2x) more efficiently in one package vs. another.


One recent SO question got me thinking about this a bit more, because up until that point I didn't think dplyr would offer much beyond what I can already do in data.table.  Here is the dplyr solution (data at end of Q):

dat %.%
  group_by(name, job) %.%
  filter(job != ""Boss"" | year == min(year)) %.%
  mutate(cumu_job2 = cumsum(job2))


Which was much better than my hack attempt at a data.table solution.  That said, good data.table solutions are also pretty good (thanks Jean-Robert, Arun, and note here I favored single statement over the strictly most optimal solution):

setDT(dat)[,
  .SD[job != ""Boss"" | year == min(year)][, cumjob := cumsum(job2)], 
  by=list(id, job)
]


The syntax for the latter may seem very esoteric, but it actually is pretty straightforward if you're used to data.table (i.e. doesn't use some of the more esoteric tricks).

Ideally what I'd like to see is some good examples were the dplyr or data.table way is substantially more concise or performs substantially better.

Examples

Usage


dplyr does not allow grouped operations that return arbitrary number of rows (from eddi's question, note: this looks like it will be implemented in dplyr 0.5, also, @beginneR shows a potential work-around using do in the answer to @eddi's question).
data.table supports rolling joins (thanks @dholstius) as well as overlap joins
data.table internally optimises expressions of the form DT[col == value] or DT[col %in% values] for speed through automatic indexing which uses binary search while using the same base R syntax. See here for some more details and a tiny benchmark.
dplyr offers standard evaluation versions of functions (e.g. regroup, summarize_each_) that can simplify the programmatic use of dplyr (note programmatic use of data.table is definitely possible, just requires some careful thought, substitution/quoting, etc, at least to my knowledge)


Benchmarks


I ran my own benchmarks and found both packages to be comparable in ""split apply combine"" style analysis, except when there are very large numbers of groups (>100K) at which point data.table becomes substantially faster.
@Arun ran some benchmarks on joins, showing that data.table scales better than dplyr as the number of groups increase (updated with recent enhancements in both packages and recent version of R).  Also, a benchmark when trying to get unique values has data.table ~6x faster.
(Unverified) has data.table 75% faster on larger versions of a group/apply/sort while dplyr was 40% faster on the smaller ones (another SO question from comments, thanks danas).
Matt, the main author of data.table, has benchmarked grouping operations on data.table, dplyr and python pandas on up to 2 billion rows (~100GB in RAM).
An older benchmark on 80K groups has data.table ~8x faster


Data

This is for the first example I showed in the question section.

dat <- structure(list(id = c(1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 2L, 2L, 
2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L), name = c(""Jane"", ""Jane"", ""Jane"", ""Jane"",

My issue is I have changed a file e.g.: README, added a new line 'this for my testing line' and saved the file, then I issued the following commands:

1779,34570758,"Why do we need middleware for async flow in Redux?

According to the docs, ""Without middleware, Redux store only supports synchronous data flow"". I don't understand why this is the case. Why can't the container component call the async API, and then dispatch the actions? 

For example, imagine a simple UI: a field and a button. When user pushes the button, the field gets populated with data from a remote server.



import * as React from 'react';
import * as Redux from 'redux';
import { Provider, connect } from 'react-redux';

const ActionTypes = {
    STARTED_UPDATING: 'STARTED_UPDATING',
    UPDATED: 'UPDATED'
};

class AsyncApi {
    static getFieldValue() {
        const promise = new Promise((resolve) => {
            setTimeout(() => {
                resolve(Math.floor(Math.random() * 100));
            }, 1000);
        });
        return promise;
    }
}

class App extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <input value={this.props.field}/>
                <button disabled={this.props.isWaiting} onClick={this.props.update}>Fetch</button>
                {this.props.isWaiting && <div>Waiting...</div>}
            </div>
        );
    }
}
App.propTypes = {
    dispatch: React.PropTypes.func,
    field: React.PropTypes.any,
    isWaiting: React.PropTypes.bool
};

const reducer = (state = { field: 'No data', isWaiting: false }, action) => {
    switch (action.type) {
        case ActionTypes.STARTED_UPDATING:
            return { ...state, isWaiting: true };
        case ActionTypes.UPDATED:
            return { ...state, isWaiting: false, field: action.payload };
        default:
            return state;
    }
};
const store = Redux.createStore(reducer);
const ConnectedApp = connect(
    (state) => {
        return { ...state };
    },
    (dispatch) => {
        return {
            update: () => {
                dispatch({
                    type: ActionTypes.STARTED_UPDATING
                });
                AsyncApi.getFieldValue()
                    .then(result => dispatch({
                        type: ActionTypes.UPDATED,
                        payload: result
                    }));
            }
        };
    })(App);
export default class extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return <Provider store={store}><ConnectedApp/></Provider>;
    }
}


When the exported component is rendered, I can click the button and the input is updated correctly. 

Note the update function in the connect call. It dispatches an action that tells the App that it is updating, and then performs an async call. After the call finishes, the provided value is dispatched as a payload of another action.

What is wrong with this approach? Why would I want to use Redux Thunk or Redux Promise, as the documentation suggests?

EDIT: I searched the Redux repo for clues, and found that Action Creators were required to be pure functions in the past. For example, here's a user trying to provide a better explanation for async data flow:


  The action creator itself is still a pure function, but the thunk function it returns doesn't need to be, and it can do our async calls


Action creators are no longer required to be pure. So, thunk/promise middleware was definitely required in the past, but it seems that this is no longer the case?

With HTML/CSS, how can I make an element that has a width and/or height that is 100% of it's parent element and still has proper padding or margins?

By ""proper"" I mean that if my parent element is 200px tall and I specify height = 100% with padding = 5px I would expect that I should get a 190px high element with border = 5px on all sides, nicely centered in the parent element.

Now, I know that that's not how the standard box model specifies it should work (although I'd like to know why, exactly...), so the obvious answer doesn't work:

#myDiv {

1810,1722726,"Is the Scala 2.8 collections library a case of ""the longest suicide note in history""?

I have just started to look at the Scala collections library re-implementation which is coming in the imminent 2.8 release. Those familiar with the library from 2.7 will notice that the library, from a usage perspective, has changed little. For example...

> List(""Paris"", ""London"").map(_.length)
res0: List[Int] List(5, 6)


...would work in either versions. The library is eminently useable: in fact it's fantastic. However, those previously unfamiliar with Scala and poking around to get a feel for the language now have to make sense of method signatures like:

def map[B, That](f: A => B)(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[Repr, B, That]): That


For such simple functionality, this is a daunting signature and one which I find myself struggling to understand. Not that I think Scala was ever likely to be the next Java (or /C/C++/C#) - I don't believe its creators were aiming it at that market - but I think it is/was certainly feasible for Scala to become the next Ruby or Python (i.e. to gain a significant commercial user-base)


Is this going to put people off coming to Scala?
Is this going to give Scala a bad name in the commercial world as an academic plaything that only dedicated PhD students can understand? Are CTOs and heads of software going to get scared off?
Was the library re-design a sensible idea?
If you're using Scala commercially, are you worried about this? Are you planning to adopt 2.8 immediately or wait to see what happens?


Steve Yegge once attacked Scala (mistakenly in my opinion) for what he saw as its overcomplicated type-system. I worry that someone is going to have a field day spreading FUD with this API (similarly to how Josh Bloch scared the JCP out of adding closures to Java).

Note - I should be clear that, whilst I believe that Joshua Bloch was influential in the rejection of the BGGA closures proposal, I don't ascribe this to anything other than his honestly-held beliefs that the proposal represented a mistake.



Despite whatever my wife and coworkers keep telling me, I don't think I'm an idiot: I have a good degree in mathematics from the University of Oxford, and I've been programming commercially for almost 12 years and in Scala for about a year (also commercially).

Note the inflammatory subject title is a quotation made about the manifesto of a UK political party in the early 1980s. This question is subjective but it is a genuine question, I've made it CW and I'd like some opinions on the matter.

Is there a method for printing to the console without a trailing newline? The console object documentation doesn't say anything regarding that:

console.log()
Prints to stdout with newline. This function can take multiple arguments in a printf()-like way. Example:
console.log('count: %d', count);

If formating elements are not found in the first string then util.inspect is used on each argument.

Git stash seems to do a lot of what I want, except that it is a little hard to script, as the if you have no changes, then git stash; git stash pop will do something different than if you do have changes in your repository.

It appears that git stash create is the answer to that problem, and everything works, except for one thing… I can't get rid of the created stash. Is there any way to get rid of the stash?

To make it 100% clear what I am doing:

Create the stash:

~/tmp/a(master) $ git stash create

~/tmp/a(master) $ git st

#
#   new file:   b
#
~/tmp/a(master) $ git reset --hard
HEAD is now at 555d572 log message


Use the stash:

~/tmp/a(master) $ git apply 60629375d0eb12348f9d31933dd348ad0f038435
fatal: can't open patch '60629375d0eb12348f9d31933dd348ad0f038435': No such file or directory

# On branch master

#   (use ""git reset HEAD <file>..."" to unstage)
#
#   new file:   b
#


Delete the stash: (except that this last bit doesn't work)

~/tmp/a(master) $ git stash drop !$
git stash drop 60629375d0eb12348f9d31933dd348ad0f038435

1854,7333232,"How to concatenate two MP4 files using FFmpeg?

I'm trying to concatenate two mp4 files using ffmpeg.  I need this to be an automatic process hence why I chose ffmpeg.  I'm converting the two files into .ts files and then concatenating them and then trying to encode that concatenated .ts file.  The files are h264 and aac encoded and I'm hoping to keep the quality the same or as close to original as possible.
ffmpeg -i part1.mp4 -vcodec copy -vbsf h264_mp4toannexb -acodec copy part1.ts
ffmpeg -i part2.mp4 -vcodec copy -vbsf h264_mp4toannexb -acodec copy part2.ts
cat part1.ts part2.ts > parts.ts
ffmpeg -y -i parts.ts -acodec copy -ar 44100 -ab 96k -coder ac -vbsf h264_mp4toannexb parts.mp4

Unfortunately I'm getting the following error message coming back from ffmpeg during encoding:
[h264 @ 0x1012600]sps_id out of range
[h264 @ 0x1012600]non-existing SPS 0 referenced in buffering period

This happens about half way through encoding which makes me think that you can't concat two .ts files together and have it work.

GitHub makes forks a little more real by stapling correspondence onto it. That is, you press the fork button and later, when you press the pull request button, the system is smart enough to email the owner. Hence, it's a little bit of a dance around repository ownership and permissions.

Yes/No? Any angst over GitHub extending Git in this direction? Or any rumors of Git absorbing the functionality?

    { Phase: ""Phase 2"", Step: ""Step 2"", Task: ""Task 2"", Value: ""40"" }

I’m displaying this information in a table. I’d like to groupby different methods, but I want to sum the values.

I’m using Underscore.js for its groupby function, which is helpful, but doesn’t do the whole trick, because I don’t want them “split up” but “merged”, more like the SQL group by method.

What I’m looking for would be able to total specific values (if requested).

So if I did groupby Phase, I’d want to receive:

[
    { Phase: ""Phase 1"", Value: 50 },
    { Phase: ""Phase 2"", Value: 130 }
]


And if I did groupy Phase / Step, I’d receive:

[
    { Phase: ""Phase 1"", Step: ""Step 1"", Value: 15 },
    { Phase: ""Phase 1"", Step: ""Step 2"", Value: 35 },
    { Phase: ""Phase 2"", Step: ""Step 1"", Value: 55 },
    { Phase: ""Phase 2"", Step: ""Step 2"", Value: 75 }
]


Is there a helpful script for this, or should I stick to using Underscore.js, and then looping through the resulting object to do the totals myself?

1876,3145089,"What is the simplest and most robust way to get the user's current location on Android?

The LocationManager API on Android seems like it's a bit of a pain to use for an application that only needs an occasional and rough approximation of the user's location.

The app I'm working on isn't really a location app per se, but it does need to get the user's location in order to display a list of nearby businesses.  It doesn't need to worry about if the user is moving around or anything like that.

Here's what I'd like to do:


Show the user a list of nearby locations.
Preload the user's location so that by the time I need it in Activity X, it will be available.
I don't particularly care about accuracy or frequency of update. Just grabbing one location is sufficient as long as it's not way off. Maybe if I want to be fancy I'll update the location once every few mins or so, but it's not a huge priority.
Work for any device as long as it has either a GPS or a Network Location provider.


It seems like it shouldn't be that hard, but it appears to me that I have to spin up two different location providers (GPS and NETWORK) and manage each's lifecycle. Not only that, but I have to duplicate the same code in multiple activities to satisfy #2. I've tried using getBestProvider() in the past to cut the solution down to just using one location provider, but that seems to only give you the best ""theoretical"" provider rather than the provider that's actually going to give you the best results.

Is there a simpler way to accomplish this?

Most of the tutorials that I've read on arrays in JavaScript (including w3schools and devguru) suggest that you can initialize an array with a certain length by passing an integer to the Array constructor using the var test = new Array(4); syntax.

After using this syntax liberally in my js files, I ran one of the files through jsLint, and it freaked out:


  Error: Problem at line 1 character 22: Expected ')' and instead saw '4'.

  Problem at line 1 character 23: Expected ';' and instead saw ')'.
  var test = new Array(4);

So I have a couple questions:

First, why?  Am I running any risk by using the new Array() syntax instead?  Are there browser incompatibilities that I should be aware of?

1926,13854425,"How to avoid reverse engineering of an APK file

I am developing a payment processing app for Android, and I want to prevent a hacker from accessing any resources, assets or source code from the APK file.
If someone changes the .apk extension to .zip then they can unzip it and easily access all the app's resources and assets, and using dex2jar and a Java decompiler, they can also access the source code. It's very easy to reverse engineer an Android APK file - for more details see Stack Overflow question Reverse engineering from an APK file to a project.
I have used the Proguard tool provided with the Android SDK. When I reverse engineer an APK file generated using a signed keystore and Proguard, I get obfuscated code.
However, the names of Android components remain unchanged and some code, like key-values used in the app, remains unchanged. As per Proguard documentation the tool can't obfuscate components mentioned in the Manifest file.
Now my questions are:

How can I completely prevent reverse engineering of an Android APK? Is this possible?

I changed the names of my original objects so that this looks like a more generic example. The query itself is not that important. What I want to ask is this:

foreach (Animal animal in sel) { /*do stuff*/ }



I noticed that if I use IEnumerable, when I debug and inspect ""sel"", which in that case is the IEnumerable, it has some interesting members: ""inner"", ""outer"", ""innerKeySelector"" and ""outerKeySelector"", these last 2 appear to be delegates. The ""inner"" member does not have ""Animal"" instances in it, but rather ""Species"" instances, which was very strange for me. The ""outer"" member does contain ""Animal"" instances. I presume that the two delegates determine which goes in and what goes out of it?
I noticed that if I use ""Distinct"", the ""inner"" contains 6 items (this is incorrect as only 2 are Distinct), but the ""outer"" does contain the correct values. Again, probably the delegated methods determine this but this is a bit more than I know about IEnumerable.
Most importantly, which of the two options is the best performance-wise?

1970,32553158,"Detect click outside React component

I'm looking for a way to detect if a click event happened outside of a component, as described in this article. jQuery closest() is used to see if the target from a click event has the dom element as one of its parents. If there is a match the click event belongs to one of the children and is thus not considered to be outside of the component.
So in my component, I want to attach a click handler to the window. When the handler fires I need to compare the target with the dom children of my component.
The click event contains properties like ""path"" which seems to hold the dom path that the event has traveled. I'm not sure what to compare or how to best traverse it, and I'm thinking someone must have already put that in a clever utility function... No?

1985,1300088,"Distinct() with lambda?

Right, so I have an enumerable and wish to get distinct values from it.
Using System.Linq, there's, of course, an extension method called Distinct. In the simple case, it can be used with no parameters, like:
var distinctValues = myStringList.Distinct();

Well and good, but if I have an enumerable of objects for which I need to specify equality, the only available overload is:
var distinctValues = myCustomerList.Distinct(someEqualityComparer);

The equality comparer argument must be an instance of IEqualityComparer<T>. I can do this, of course, but it's somewhat verbose and, well, cludgy.
What I would have expected is an overload that would take a lambda, say a Func<T, T, bool>:
var distinctValues = myCustomerList.Distinct((c1, c2) => c1.CustomerId == c2.CustomerId);

Anyone know if some such extension exists, or some equivalent workaround? Or am I missing something?
Alternatively, is there a way of specifying an IEqualityComparer inline (embarrass me)?
Update
I found a reply by Anders Hejlsberg to a post in an MSDN forum on this subject. He says:

The problem you're going to run into is that when two objects compare
equal they must have the same GetHashCode return value (or else the
hash table used internally by Distinct will not function correctly).
We use IEqualityComparer because it packages compatible
implementations of Equals and GetHashCode into a single interface.

I suppose that makes sense.

2025,7310521,"Node.js Best Practice Exception Handling

I just started trying out node.js a few days ago. I've realized that the Node is terminated whenever I have an unhandled exception in my program. This is different than the normal server container that I have been exposed to where only the Worker Thread dies when unhandled exceptions occur and the container would still be able to receive the request. This raises a few questions:


Is process.on('uncaughtException') the only effective way to guard against it? 
Will process.on('uncaughtException') catch the unhandled exception during execution of asynchronous processes as well?
Is there a module that is already built (such as sending email or writing to a file) that I could leverage in the case of uncaught exceptions?


I would appreciate any pointer/article that would show me the common best practices for handling uncaught exceptions in node.js

2026,10024739,"How to determine when Fragment becomes visible in ViewPager

Problem: Fragment onResume() in ViewPager is fired before the fragment becomes actually visible.

For example, I have 2 fragments with ViewPager and FragmentPagerAdapter. The second fragment is only available for authorized users and I need to ask the user to log in when the fragment becomes visible (using an alert dialog).

BUT the ViewPager creates the second fragment when the first is visible in order to cache the second fragment and makes it visible when the user starts swiping.

So the onResume() event is fired in the second fragment long before it becomes visible. That's why I'm trying to find an event which fires when the second fragment becomes visible to show a dialog at the appropriate moment.

How can this be done?

2087,70528,"Why are Python's 'private' methods not actually private?

Python gives us the ability to create 'private' methods and variables within a class by prepending double underscores to the name, like this: __myPrivateMethod(). How, then, can one explain this
>>>> class MyClass:
...     def myPublicMethod(self):
...             print 'public method'
...     def __myPrivateMethod(self):
...             print 'this is private!!'
...
>>> obj = MyClass()

>>> obj.myPublicMethod()
public method

>>> obj.__myPrivateMethod()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module>
AttributeError: MyClass instance has no attribute '__myPrivateMethod'

>>> dir(obj)
['_MyClass__myPrivateMethod', '__doc__', '__module__', 'myPublicMethod']

>>> obj._MyClass__myPrivateMethod()
this is private!!

What's the deal?!
I'll explain this a little for those who didn't quite get that.
>>> class MyClass:
...     def myPublicMethod(self):
...             print 'public method'
...     def __myPrivateMethod(self):
...             print 'this is private!!'
...
>>> obj = MyClass()

I create a class with a public method and a private method and instantiate it.
Next, I call its public method.
>>> obj.myPublicMethod()
public method

Next, I try and call its private method.
>>> obj.__myPrivateMethod()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module>
AttributeError: MyClass instance has no attribute '__myPrivateMethod'

Everything looks good here; we're unable to call it. It is, in fact, 'private'. Well, actually it isn't. Running dir() on the object reveals a new magical method that Python creates magically for all of your 'private' methods.
>>> dir(obj)
['_MyClass__myPrivateMethod', '__doc__', '__module__', 'myPublicMethod']

This new method's name is always an underscore, followed by the class name, followed by the method name.
>>> obj._MyClass__myPrivateMethod()
this is private!!

So much for encapsulation, eh?
In any case, I'd always heard Python doesn't support encapsulation, so why even try? What gives?

2088,7124778,"How can I match ""anything up until this sequence of characters"" in a regular expression?

Take this regular expression: /^[^abc]/. This will match any single character at the beginning of a string, except a, b, or c.
If you add a * after it – /^[^abc]*/ – the regular expression will continue to add each subsequent character to the result, until it meets either an a, or b, or c.

I have the following dummy test script:

This will print the result 0.020000000000000004 while it should just print 0.02 (if you use your calculator). As far as I understood this is due to errors in the floating point multiplication precision.

Does anyone have a good solution so that in such case I get the correct result 0.02? I know there are functions like toFixed or rounding would be another possibility, but I'd like to really have the whole number printed without any cutting and rounding. Just wanted to know if one of you has some nice, elegant solution.

Of course, otherwise I'll round to some 10 digits or so.

2150,12264970,"Why is my program slow when looping over exactly 8192 elements?

Here is the extract from the program in question. The matrix img[][] has the size SIZE×SIZE, and is initialized at:

img[j][i] = 2 * j + i

Then, you make a matrix res[][], and each field in here is made to be the average of the 9 fields around it in the img matrix. The border is left at 0 for simplicity.

for(i=1;i<SIZE-1;i++) 
    for(j=1;j<SIZE-1;j++) {
        res[j][i]=0;
        for(k=-1;k<2;k++) 
            for(l=-1;l<2;l++) 
                res[j][i] += img[j+l][i+k];
        res[j][i] /= 9;
}


That's all there's to the program. For completeness' sake, here is what comes before. No code comes after. As you can see, it's just initialization.

#define SIZE 8192
float img[SIZE][SIZE]; // input image
float res[SIZE][SIZE]; //result of mean filter
int i,j,k,l;
for(i=0;i<SIZE;i++) 
    for(j=0;j<SIZE;j++) 
        img[j][i] = (2*j+i)%8196;


Basically, this program is slow when SIZE is a multiple of 2048, e.g. the execution times:

SIZE = 8191: 3.44 secs
SIZE = 8192: 7.20 secs
SIZE = 8193: 3.18 secs


The compiler is GCC.
From what I know, this is because of memory management, but I don't really know too much about that subject, which is why I'm asking here.

Also how to fix this would be nice, but if someone could explain these execution times I'd already be happy enough.

I already know of malloc/free, but the problem is not amount of memory used, it's merely execution time, so I don't know how that would help.

I got my timing results by calling timeit.timeit(""[]"") and timeit.timeit(""list()""), and timeit.timeit(""{}"") and timeit.timeit(""dict()""), to compare lists and dictionaries, respectively. I'm running Python 2.7.9.

I recently discovered ""Why is if True slower than if 1?"" that compares the performance of if True to if 1 and seems to touch on a similar literal-versus-global scenario; perhaps it's worth considering as well.

2164,57776,"How do I ""Add Existing Item"" an entire directory structure in Visual Studio?

I have a free standing set of files not affiliated with any C# project at all that reside in a complicated nested directory structure.

I want to add them in that format to a different directory in an ASP.NET web application I am working on; while retaining the same structure. So, I copied the folder into the target location of my project and I tried to “add existing  item” only to lose the previous folder hierarchy.

Usually I have re-created the directories by hand, copied across on a one-to-one basis, and then added existing items. There are simply too many directories/items in this case.

So how do you add existing directories and files in Visual Studio 2008?

Whenever we talk about dynamic languages like Python, speed is one of the top issues. To solve this, they say PyPy is 6.3 times faster.

The second issue is parallelism, the infamous Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). For this, PyPy says it can give GIL-less Python.

The numbering is entirely off using Java 10. So what is happening here? Is it a bug in Java 10?
Follow ups from the comments:

The issue appears when compiled with Java 9 or later (we found it in Java 10). Compiling this code on Java 8, then running in Java 9 or any later version, including Java 11 early access, gives the expected result.

This kind of code is non-standard, but is valid according to the spec. It was found by Kevin Cruijssen in a discussion in a golfing challenge, hence the weird use case encountered.

Didier L simplified the issue with this much smaller and more understandable code:
  class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      String[] array = { """" };
      array[test()] += ""a"";
    }
    static int test() {
      System.out.println(""evaluated"");
      return 0;
    }
  }

Result when compiled in Java 8:
  evaluated

Result when compiled in Java 9 and 10:
  evaluated
  evaluated


The issue seems to be limited to the string concatenation and assignment operator (+=) with an expression with side effect(s) as the left operand, like in array[test()]+=""a"", array[ix++]+=""a"", test()[index]+=""a"", or test().field+=""a"". To enable string concatenation, at least one of the sides must have type String. Trying to reproduce this on other types or constructs failed.

However, using the java.text.SimpleDateFormat, I cannot convert the correctly formatted String 2010-01-01T12:00:00+01:00. I have to convert it first to 2010-01-01T12:00:00+0100, without the colon. 

So, the current solution is

SimpleDateFormat ISO8601DATEFORMAT = new SimpleDateFormat(""yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZ"", Locale.GERMANY);
String date = ""2010-01-01T12:00:00+01:00"".replaceAll(""\\+0([0-9]){1}\\:00"", ""+0$100"");

Answer

Thanks to JuanZe's comment, I found the Joda-Time magic, it is also described here.

So, the solution is

DateTimeFormatter parser2 = ISODateTimeFormat.dateTimeNoMillis();
String jtdate = ""2010-01-01T12:00:00+01:00"";
System.out.println(parser2.parseDateTime(jtdate));


Or more simply, use the default parser via the constructor:

DateTime dt = new DateTime( ""2010-01-01T12:00:00+01:00"" ) ;


To me, this is nice.

2219,9032856,"What is the explanation for these bizarre JavaScript behaviours mentioned in the 'Wat' talk for CodeMash 2012?

The 'Wat' talk for CodeMash 2012 basically points out a few bizarre quirks with Ruby and JavaScript.

I have made a JSFiddle of the results at http://jsfiddle.net/fe479/9/.

The behaviours specific to JavaScript (as I don't know Ruby) are listed below.

I found in the JSFiddle that some of my results didn't correspond with those in the video, and I am not sure why. I am, however, curious to know how JavaScript is handling working behind the scenes in each case.

Empty Array + Empty Array
[] + []
result:
<Empty String>


I am quite curious about the + operator when used with arrays in JavaScript.
This matches the video's result.

Empty Array + Object
[] + {}
result:
[Object]


This matches the video's result. What's going on here? Why is this an object. What does the + operator do?

Object + Empty Array
{} + []
result:
[Object]


This doesn't match the video. The video suggests that the result is 0, whereas I get [Object].

Object + Object
{} + {}
result:
[Object][Object]


This doesn't match the video either, and how does outputting a variable result in two objects? Maybe my JSFiddle is wrong.

Array(16).join(""wat"" - 1)
result:
NaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaN


Doing wat + 1 results in wat1wat1wat1wat1...

I suspect this is just straightforward behaviour that trying to subtract a number from a string results in NaN.

CGI is a Common Gateway Interface. As the name says, it is a ""common"" gateway interface for everything. It is so trivial and naive from the name. I feel that I understood this and I felt this every time I encountered this word. But frankly, I didn't. I'm still confused. 

I am a PHP programmer with web development experience. 


  user (client) request for page ---> webserver(->embedded PHP
  interpreter) ----> Server side(PHP) Script ---> MySQL Server.


Now say my PHP Script can fetch results from MySQL server & MATLAB server & some other server.

So, now PHP Script is the CGI? Because its interface for the between webserver & All other servers? I don't know. Sometimes they call CGI, a technology & other times they call CGI a program or some other server. 


What exactly is CGI?
Whats the big deal with /cgi-bin/*.cgi? What's up with this? I don't know what is this cgi-bin directory on the server for. I don't know why they have *.cgi extensions.
Why does Perl always comes in the way. CGI & Perl (language). I also don't know what's up with these two. Almost all the time I keep hearing these two in combination ""CGI & Perl"". This book is another great example CGI Programming with Perl. Why not ""CGI Programming with PHP/JSP/ASP""? I never saw such things. 
CGI Programming in C, confuses me a lot. ""in C""?? Seriously?? I don't know what to say. I'm just confused. ""in C""?? This changes everything. Program needs to be compiled and executed. This entirely changes my view of web programming. When do I compile? How does the program gets executed (because it will be a machine code, so it must execute as a independent process). How does it communicate with the web server? IPC? and interfacing with all the servers (in my example MATLAB & MySQL) using socket programming? I'm lost!!
People say that CGI is deprecated and isn't in use anymore. Is that so? What is the latest update?



  Once, I ran into a situation where I
  had to give HTTP PUT request access to
  web server (Apache HTTPD). Its a long
  back. So, as far as I remember this is
  what I did:

  all HTTP PUT requests to some
  put.php ( I had to write this PHP
  script)
  Implement put.php to handle the request (save the file to the location
  mentioned)
  
  
  People said that I wrote a CGI Script.
  Seriously, I didn't have a clue what
  they were talking about.

People have referred to this as a ""stack trace"". What is a stack trace? What can it tell me about the error that's happening in my program?



About this question - quite often I see a question come through where a novice programmer is ""getting an error"", and they simply paste their stack trace and some random block of code without understanding what the stack trace is or how they can use it. This question is intended as a reference for novice programmers who might need help understanding the value of a stack trace.

When creating a simple object hierarchy in Python, I'd like to be able to invoke methods of the parent class from a derived class.  In Perl and Java, there is a keyword for this (super).  In Perl, I might do this:

}

package Bar;
@ISA = qw(Foo);

sub frotz {

In Python, it appears that I have to name the parent class explicitly from the child.
In the example above, I'd have to do something like Foo::frotz().

When using code files, you typically don't need longer lines to wrap around. However, with .md files this is in fact rather useful. However, I can't seem to find the option to enable word wrap so longer lines will be wrapped.

To reproduce, open Visual Studio Code resized to a small-enough window, and enter the following text in a new document:

This is my test lorem ipsum. This is my test lorem ipsum. This is my test lorem ipsum. This is my test lorem ipsum. This is my test lorem ipsum. This is my test lorem ipsum. This is my test lorem ipsum. This is my test lorem ipsum. This is my test lorem ipsum.
A linebreak before this. 


The effect is this:

Meticulously going through the menu of Visual Studio Code: didn't find it;
Using the Command Palette with ""wrap"": gives no matching commands.


Perhaps it's not possible, and I'd need to file a feature request? Or am I missing something?

Note that I'd like to be able to turn it on and off quickly. For one, @PanagiotisKanavos mentioned in comments this solution to change wrapping behavior in the settings, but I'm looking for a quick command or menu option to do this (much like Notepad++ and Sublime Text 2 have).

Always look at the code context. The syntax mistake often hides in the mentioned or in previous code lines. Compare your code against syntax examples from the manual.

While not every case matches the other. Yet there are some general steps to solve syntax mistakes.
This references summarized the common pitfalls:

While Stack Overflow is also welcoming rookie coders, it's mostly targetted at professional programming questions.

Answering everyone's coding mistakes and narrow typos is considered mostly off-topic.
So please take the time to follow the basic steps, before posting syntax fixing requests.
If you still have to, please show your own solving initiative, attempted fixes, and your thought process on what looks or might be wrong.

If your browser displays error messages such as ""SyntaxError: illegal character"", then it's not actually php-related, but a javascript-syntax error.

Syntax errors raised on vendor code: Finally, consider that if the syntax error was not raised by editing your codebase, but after an external vendor package install or upgrade, it could be due to PHP version incompatibility, so check the vendor's requirements against your platform setup.

I try to avoid for loops when they are not completely necessary because:

They add to the number of lines of code even if they are tucked away in another function.

Someone reading my code has to figure out what I am doing in that for loop. Even if it is commented and has meaningful variables names, they still have to make sure it is not doing anything ""clever"".

Programmers love to put clever things in for loops, even if I write it to ""only do what it is intended to do"", that does not preclude someone coming along and adding some additional clever ""fix"".

They are very often easy to get wrong. For loops involving indexes tend to generate off by one bugs.

For loops often reuse the same variables, increasing the chance of really hard to find scoping bugs.

For loops increase the number of places a bug hunter has to look.

2339,9050345,"Selecting last element in JavaScript array

I'm making an application that updates a user's location and path in real time and displays this on a Google Map. I have functionality that allows multiple users to be tracked at the same time using an object, which is updated every second. 

Right now, when a user pressed a button in the Android app, the coordinates are sent to a database and each time the location changes, a marker is updated on the map (and a polyline is formed). 

Since I have multiple users, I send a unique and randomly generated alphanumeric string so that I can display an individual path for each user. When the JS pulls this data from the database, it checks if the user exists, if it does not, it creates a new key with the value being a list. It would look something like this:

loc = {f096012e-2497-485d-8adb-7ec0b9352c52: [new google.maps.LatLng(39, -86),
                                              new google.maps.LatLng(38, -87),
                                              new google.maps.LatLng(37, -88)],
       44ed0662-1a9e-4c0e-9920-106258dcc3e7: [new google.maps.LatLng(40, -83),
                                              new google.maps.LatLng(41, -82),
                                              new google.maps.LatLng(42, -81)]}


What I'm doing is storing a list of coordinates as the value of the key, which is the user's ID. My program keeps updating this list each time the location is changed by adding to the list (this works properly). 

What I need to do is update the marker's location each time the location changes. I would like to do this by selecting the last item in the array since that would be the last known location. Right now, each time the location is changed a new marker is added to the map (each one of the points in the example would show a marker at that location) so markers continue to be added. 

I would use a ´for (x in loc)` statement each time the location updates to grab the last location from the list and use that to update the marker. How do I select this last element from the array within the hash?

2353,6115896,"Understanding checked vs unchecked exceptions in Java

Joshua Bloch in ""Effective Java"" said that 


  Use checked exceptions for
  recoverable conditions and runtime
  exceptions for programming errors
  (Item 58 in 2nd edition)


Let's see if I understand this correctly.

Here is my understanding of a checked exception:

try{
    String userInput = //read in user input
    Long id = Long.parseLong(userInput);
}catch(NumberFormatException e){
    id = 0; //recover the situation by setting the id to 0
}


1. Is the above considered a checked exception?

2. Is RuntimeException an unchecked exception?

Here is my understanding of an unchecked exception:

try{
    File file = new File(""my/file/path"");
    FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(file);   
}catch(FileNotFoundException e){

//3. What should I do here?
    //Should I ""throw new FileNotFoundException(""File not found"");""?
    //Should I log?
    //Or should I System.exit(0);?
}


4. Now, couldn't the above code also be a checked exception? I can try to recover the situation like this? Can I? (Note: my 3rd question is inside the catch above)

try{
    String filePath = //read in from user input file path
    File file = new File(filePath);
    FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(file);   
}catch(FileNotFoundException e){
    //Kindly prompt the user an error message
    //Somehow ask the user to re-enter the file path.
}


5. Why do people do this?

public void someMethod throws Exception{

}


Why do they let the exception bubble up? Isn't handling the error sooner better? Why bubble up? 

6. Should I bubble up the exact exception or mask it using Exception?

Below are my readings

In Java, when should I create a checked exception, and when should it be a runtime exception?

I am trying to support CORS in my Node.js application that uses the Express.js web framework. I have read a Google group discussion about how to handle this, and read a few articles about how CORS works. First, I did this (code is written in CoffeeScript syntax):

app.options ""*"", (req, res) ->
  res.header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*'
  res.header 'Access-Control-Allow-Credentials', true
  # try: 'POST, GET, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS'

  # try: 'X-Requested-With, X-HTTP-Method-Override, Content-Type, Accept'
  res.header 'Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-Type'

It doesn't seem to work. It seems like my browser (Chrome) is not sending the initial OPTIONS request. When I just updated the block for the resource I need to submit a cross-origin GET request to:

app.get ""/somethingelse"", (req, res) ->
  # ...
  res.header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*'

  res.header 'Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'POST, GET, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS'
  res.header 'Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-Type'
  # ...


It works (in Chrome). This also works in Safari.

I have read that...


  In a browser implementing CORS, each cross-origin GET or POST request is preceded by an OPTIONS request that checks whether the GET or POST is OK.


So my main question is, how come this doesn't seem to happen in my case? Why isn't my app.options block called? Why do I need to set the headers in my main app.get block?

I have a timezone-unaware datetime object, to which I need to add a time zone in order to be able to compare it with other timezone-aware datetime objects. I do not want to convert my entire application to timezone unaware for this one legacy case.
What I've Tried
First, to demonstrate the problem:
Python 2.6.1 (r261:67515, Jun 24 2010, 21:47:49) 
[GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5646)] on darwin
Type ""help"", ""copyright"", ""credits"" or ""license"" for more information.
>>> import datetime
>>> import pytz
>>> unaware = datetime.datetime(2011,8,15,8,15,12,0)
>>> unaware
datetime.datetime(2011, 8, 15, 8, 15, 12)
>>> aware = datetime.datetime(2011,8,15,8,15,12,0,pytz.UTC)
>>> aware
datetime.datetime(2011, 8, 15, 8, 15, 12, tzinfo=<UTC>)
>>> aware == unaware
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: can't compare offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes

First, I tried astimezone:
>>> unaware.astimezone(pytz.UTC)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module>
ValueError: astimezone() cannot be applied to a naive datetime
>>>

It's not terribly surprising this failed, since it's actually trying to do a conversion.  Replace seemed like a better choice (as per How do I get a value of datetime.today() in Python that is ""timezone aware""?):
>>> unaware.replace(tzinfo=pytz.UTC)
datetime.datetime(2011, 8, 15, 8, 15, 12, tzinfo=<UTC>)
>>> unaware == aware
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: can't compare offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes
>>> 

But as you can see, replace seems to set the tzinfo, but not make the object aware.  I'm getting ready to fall back to doctoring the input string to have a timezone before parsing it (I'm using dateutil for parsing, if that matters), but that seems incredibly kludgy.
Also, I've tried this in both Python 2.6 and Python 2.7, with the same results.
Context
I am writing a parser for some data files. There is an old format I need to support where the date string does not have a timezone indicator. I've already fixed the data source, but I still need to support the legacy data format. A one time conversion of the legacy data is not an option for various business BS reasons. While in general, I do not like the idea of hard-coding a default timezone, in this case it seems like the best option. I know with reasonable confidence that all the legacy data in question is in UTC, so I'm prepared to accept the risk of defaulting to that in this case.

2393,26881441,"Can you get the number of lines of code from a GitHub repository?

In a GitHub repository you can see “language statistics”, which displays the percentage of the project that’s written in a language. It doesn’t, however, display how many lines of code the project consists of. Often, I want to quickly get an impression of the scale and complexity of a project, and the count of lines of code can give a good first impression. 500 lines of code implies a relatively simple project, 100,000 lines of code implies a very large/complicated project.

So, is it possible to get the lines of code written in the various languages from a GitHub repository, preferably without cloning it?



The question “Count number of lines in a git repository” asks how to count the lines of code in a local Git repository, but:


You have to clone the project, which could be massive. Cloning a project like Wine, for example, takes ages.
You would count lines in files that wouldn’t necessarily be code, like i13n files.
If you count just (for example) Ruby files, you’d potentially miss massive amount of code in other languages, like JavaScript. You’d have to know beforehand which languages the project uses. You’d also have to repeat the count for every language the project uses.


All in all, this is potentially far too time-intensive for “quickly checking the scale of a project”.

I want to have a unique constraint on a column which I am going to populate with GUIDs. However, my data contains null values for this columns. How do I create the constraint that allows multiple null values?

  Id INT CONSTRAINT PK_MyTable PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY,
  Name NVARCHAR(250) NOT NULL,
  LibraryCardId UNIQUEIDENTIFIER NULL,
  CONSTRAINT UQ_People_LibraryCardId UNIQUE (LibraryCardId)

INSERT INTO People (Name, LibraryCardId) 
 VALUES ('John Doe', 'AAAAAAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAAAAAAAAAA');

-- This also works fine, obviously:
INSERT INTO People (Name, LibraryCardId) 
VALUES ('Marie Doe', 'BBBBBBBB-BBBB-BBBB-BBBB-BBBBBBBBBBBB');

-- This would *correctly* fail:
--INSERT INTO People (Name, LibraryCardId) 
--VALUES ('John Doe the Second', 'AAAAAAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAAAAAAAAAA');

-- This works fine this one first time:
INSERT INTO People (Name, LibraryCardId) 
VALUES ('Richard Roe', NULL);

-- THE PROBLEM: This fails even though I'd like to be able to do this:
INSERT INTO People (Name, LibraryCardId) 
VALUES ('Marcus Roe', NULL);


The final statement fails with a message:

2404,2171177,"What is an application binary interface (ABI)?

I never clearly understood what an ABI is. Please don't point me to a Wikipedia article. If I could understand it, I wouldn't be here posting such a lengthy post.

This is my mindset about different interfaces:

A TV remote is an interface between the user and the TV. It is an existing entity, but useless (doesn't provide any functionality) by itself. All the functionality for each of those buttons on the remote is implemented in the television set.


  Interface: It is an ""existing entity"" layer between the
  functionality and consumer of that functionality. An interface by itself
  doesn't do anything. It just invokes the functionality lying behind.
  
  Now depending on who the user is there are different type of interfaces.
  
  Command Line Interface (CLI) commands are the existing entities,
  the consumer is the user and functionality lies behind.
  
  functionality: my software functionality which solves some
  purpose to which we are describing this interface.
  
  existing entities: commands
  
  consumer: user
  
  Graphical User Interface(GUI) window, buttons, etc. are the existing
  entities, and again the consumer is the user and functionality lies behind.
  
  functionality: my software functionality which solves some problem to which we are describing this interface.
  
  existing entities: window, buttons etc..
  
  consumer: user
  
  Application Programming Interface(API) functions (or to be
  more correct) interfaces (in interfaced based programming) are the
  existing entities, consumer here is another program not a user, and again
  functionality lies behind this layer.
  
  functionality: my software functionality which solves some
  problem to which we are describing this interface.
  
  existing entities: functions, Interfaces (array of functions).
  
  consumer: another program/application.
  
  Application Binary Interface (ABI) Here is where my problem starts.
  
  functionality: ???
  
  existing entities: ???
  
  consumer: ???



I've written software in different languages and provided different kinds of interfaces (CLI, GUI, and API), but I'm not sure if I have ever provided any ABI.


Wikipedia says:


  ABIs cover details such as
  
  
  data type, size, and alignment;
  the calling convention, which controls how functions' arguments are
  passed and return values retrieved;
  the system call numbers and how an application should make system calls
  to the operating system;
  
  
  Other ABIs standardize details such as
  
  
  the C++ name mangling,
  exception propagation, and
  calling convention between compilers on the same platform, but do
  not require cross-platform compatibility.
  



Who needs these details? Please don't say the OS. I know assembly programming. I know how linking & loading works. I know exactly what happens inside.
Why did C++ name mangling come in? I thought we are talking at the binary level. Why do languages come in?


Anyway, I've downloaded the [PDF] System V Application Binary Interface Edition 4.1 (1997-03-18) to see what exactly it contains. Well, most of it didn't make any sense.


Why does it contain two chapters (4th & 5th) to describe the ELF file format? In fact, these are the only two significant chapters of that specification. The rest of the chapters are ""processor specific"". Anyway, I though that it is a completely different topic. Please don't say that ELF file format specifications are the ABI. It doesn't qualify to be an interface according to the definition.
I know, since we are talking at such a low level it must be very specific. But I'm not sure how is it ""instruction set architecture (ISA)"" specific?
Where can I find Microsoft Windows' ABI?


So, these are the major queries that are bugging me.

2421,960431,"How can I convert List<Integer> to int[] in Java?

How can I convert a List<Integer> to int[] in Java?
I'm confused because List.toArray() actually returns an Object[], which can be cast to neither Integer[] nor int[].
Right now I'm using a loop to do so:
int[] toIntArray(List<Integer> list) {
  int[] ret = new int[list.size()];
  for(int i = 0; i < ret.length; i++)
    ret[i] = list.get(i);

2422,5905896,"IntelliJ inspection gives ""Cannot resolve symbol"" but still compiles code

Platform: IntelliJ Community Edition 10.0.3
SDK: jdk1.6.0_21
OS: Windows 7

So I have a strange situation with IntelliJ that has me completely stumped.  I setup a Maven project and add log4j as a dependency in the pom.xml file.  The IDEA inspections run fine and my unit tests all compile and run.

I then added hunnysoft's jmime library to my local maven repository using the mvn install:install-file as follows.

mvn install:install-file -Dfile=jmime.jar -DgroupId=jmime \
-DartifactId=jmime -Dversion=3.1.1e -Dpackaging=jar


Maven installed the jar file just fine into my local repository.

I then went into IntelliJ's Settings => Maven => Repository Services and Updated my local repository (so that IntelliJ would reindex the repository contents).

Finally, I added the following dependency to my pom.xml file (just above the log4j dependency).

<dependency>
    <groupId>jmime</groupId>
    <artifactId>jmime</artifactId>
    <version>3.1.1e</version>
</dependency>


I now create a new class as follows:

package com.stackoverflow.question;

import org.apache.log4j.Logger;
import com.hunnysoft.jmime.ByteString;
import com.hunnysoft.jmime.Field;
import com.hunnysoft.jmime.FieldBody;

public class StackOverflowQuestion {
    public Field create(String name, String text) {
        Logger.getLogger(getClass()).debug(""create entered"");
        FieldBody body = new FieldBody();
        body.setText(new ByteString(text));
        Field field = new Field();
        field.setFieldName(name);
        field.setFieldBody(body);
        return field;
    }
}


Now for the weirdness.  IntelliJ's intention mechanism picks up and recognizes the Logger import in the maven pom file just fine.  However, for all of the hunnysoft imports it reports: ""Cannot resolve symbol 'ByteString/Field/FieldBody'"", BUT Build => Compile 'StackOverflowQuestion.java' compiles everything correctly and the unit test I created for this class runs fine (though the intentions mark the call to create() as a problem area too).

So somewhere, somehow IntelliJ is ignoring the jmime.jar file for the intention subsystem.  I'm confused because the log4j dependency works fine and everything compiles and runs fine.  F12 (""Go To Declaration"") works on the Logger import, but breaks on all the jmime imports.

Oh, one other thing, if I go to the 'Packages' view in the ""Projects"" window the ""com.hunnysoft.jmime"" package appears and I can see ALL of the classes I imported in the code snippet above under ""Libraries"".  Removing the above dependency from the pom.xml file causes this package to disappear and the compilation breaks.

It appears that the inspection's classpath is broken, but there does not seem to be a setting for this anywhere in the Settings => Intentions | Compiler areas (not that I expected any such settings, I believe the IDEA should already know the correct classpath based on the pom file and JDK).

As a final experiment I created a brand new standard J2SE application project (without using maven) and added the jmime.jar file directly to the project as one of its libraries.  I run into exactly the same problems as described above in this new project.

Here is the MANIFEST.MF from the jmime jar file.

Manifest-Version: 1.0
Ant-Version: Apache Ant 1.5.4
Created-By: 10.0-b23 (Sun Microsystems Inc.)

Name: com/hunnysoft/jmime/
Sealed: true

Specification-Version: 3.1.1
Specification-Vendor: Hunny Software, Inc.
Implementation-Title: com.hunnysoft.jmime
Implementation-Version: 3.1.1E
Implementation-Vendor: Hunny Software, Inc.


I don't see anything unusual in this jar file.

My best guess is that perhaps the problem might be a missing dependency issue.  But AFAIK jmime is supposed to be self contained (JarAnalyzer doesn't come up with anything, but I'm not sure it would if a dependency jar is missing).

So, anyone have any IDEAs?

2434,1443158,"Binary Data in JSON String. Something better than Base64

The JSON format natively doesn't support binary data. The binary data has to be escaped so that it can be placed into a string element (i.e. zero or more Unicode chars in double quotes using backslash escapes) in JSON.

An obvious method to escape binary data is to use Base64. However, Base64 has a high processing overhead. Also it expands 3 bytes into 4 characters which leads to an increased data size by around 33%.

One use case for this is the v0.8 draft of the CDMI cloud storage API specification. You create data objects via a REST-Webservice using JSON, e.g.

PUT /MyContainer/BinaryObject HTTP/1.1

2441,6832445,"How can bcrypt have built-in salts?

Coda Hale's article ""How To Safely Store a Password"" claims that:

bcrypt has salts built-in to prevent rainbow table attacks.

He cites this paper, which says that in OpenBSD's implementation of bcrypt:

OpenBSD generates the 128-bit bcrypt salt from an arcfour
(arc4random(3)) key stream, seeded with random data the kernel
collects from device timings.

I don't understand how this can work. In my conception of a salt:

It needs to be different for each stored password, so that a separate rainbow table would have to be generated for each
It needs to be stored somewhere so that it's repeatable: when a user tries to log in, we take their password attempt, repeat the same salt-and-hash procedure we did when we originally stored their password, and compare

When I'm using Devise (a Rails login manager) with bcrypt, there is no salt column in the database, so I'm confused. If the salt is random and not stored anywhere, how can we reliably repeat the hashing process?
In short, how can bcrypt have built-in salts?

Summary:

C: 100%
Python: 692% (118% with PyPy)
Erlang: 436% (135% thanks to RichardC)
Haskell: 1421%

I suppose that C has a big advantage as it uses long for the calculations and not arbitrary length integers as the other three. Also it doesn't need to load a runtime first (Do the others?).
Question 1:
Do Erlang, Python and Haskell lose speed due to using arbitrary length integers or don't they as long as the values are less than MAXINT?
Question 2:
Why is Haskell so slow? Is there a compiler flag that turns off the brakes or is it my implementation? (The latter is quite probable as Haskell is a book with seven seals to me.)
Question 3:
Can you offer me some hints how to optimize these implementations without changing the way I determine the factors? Optimization in any way: nicer, faster, more ""native"" to the language.
EDIT:
Question 4:
Do my functional implementations permit LCO (last call optimization, a.k.a tail recursion elimination) and hence avoid adding unnecessary frames onto the call stack?
I really tried to implement the same algorithm as similar as possible in the four languages, although I have to admit that my Haskell and Erlang knowledge is very limited.

2539,7153659,"Generate an integer that is not among four billion given ones

I have been given this interview question:


  Given an input file with four billion integers, provide an algorithm to generate an integer which is not contained in the file. Assume you have 1 GB memory. Follow up with what you would do if you have only 10 MB of memory.


My analysis:

The size of the file is 4×109×4 bytes = 16 GB.

We can do external sorting, thus letting us know the range of the integers.

My question is what is the best way to detect the missing integer in the sorted big integer sets?

My understanding (after reading all the answers):

Assuming we are talking about 32-bit integers, there are 232 = 4*109 distinct integers.

Case 1: we have 1 GB = 1 * 109 * 8 bits = 8 billion bits memory.

Solution:

If we use one bit representing one distinct integer, it is enough. we don't need sort.

Implementation:

int radix = 8;
byte[] bitfield = new byte[0xffffffff/radix];
void F() throws FileNotFoundException{
    Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader(""a.txt""));
    while(in.hasNextInt()){
        int n = in.nextInt();
        bitfield[n/radix] |= (1 << (n%radix));
    }

    for(int i = 0; i< bitfield.lenght; i++){
        for(int j =0; j<radix; j++){
            if( (bitfield[i] & (1<<j)) == 0) System.out.print(i*radix+j);
        }
    }
}


Case 2: 10 MB memory = 10 * 106 * 8 bits = 80 million bits


  Solution:
  
  For all possible 16-bit prefixes, there are 216 number of
  integers = 65536, we need 216 * 4 * 8 = 2 million bits. We need build 65536 buckets. For each bucket, we need 4 bytes holding all possibilities because the worst case is all the 4 billion integers belong to the same bucket.
  
  
  Build the counter of each bucket through the first pass through the file.
  Scan the buckets, find the first one who has less than 65536 hit.
  Build new buckets whose high 16-bit prefixes are we found in step2
  through second pass of the file
  Scan the buckets built in step3, find the first bucket which doesnt
  have a hit.
  
  
  The code is very similar to above one.


Conclusion:
    We decrease memory through increasing file pass.




A clarification for those arriving late: The question, as asked, does not say that there is exactly one integer that is not contained in the file—at least that's not how most people interpret it. Many comments in the comment thread are about that variation of the task, though. Unfortunately the comment that introduced it to the comment thread was later deleted by its author, so now it looks like the orphaned replies to it just misunderstood everything. It's very confusing, sorry.

2546,22111060,"What is the difference between ""expose"" and ""publish"" in Docker?

I'm experimenting with Dockerfiles, and I think I understand most of the logic. However, I don't see the difference between ""exposing"" and ""publishing"" a port in this context.

All the tutorials I have seen first include the EXPOSE command in the Dockerfile:

...
EXPOSE 8080
...


They then build an image from this Dockerfile:

$ docker build -t an_image - < Dockerfile


And then publish the same port as above when running the image:

$ docker run -d -p 8080 an_image


or publish all ports using

$ docker run -d -P an_image


What is the point of exposing a port in the Dockerfile, if it will be published anyway? Would there ever be a need to expose a port first, and not publish it later? Effectively, I would like to specify all the ports that I will use in the Dockerfile when creating the image, and then not bother with them again, running them simply with:

$ docker run -d an_image


Is this possible?

2559,22620393,"Various ways to remove local Git changes

I just cloned a git repository and checked out a branch. I worked on it, and then decided to remove all my local changes, as I wanted the original copy.

In short, I had to do the following two commands to remove my local changes

git checkout .

git clean -f


My question is,

(1) Is this the correct approach in getting rid of local changes, or else please let me know the correct approach.

(2) when do we use git reset --hard as i am able to reset even without this command

Thanks

*Solution : Major Edit(s): 03/26 : * 
Replaced many of vague terms with git specific terminology
 [tracked/untracked/staged/unstaged]

There could be only three categories of files when we make local changes:


  Type 1. Staged Tracked files
  
  Type 2. Unstaged Tracked files
  
  Type 3. Unstaged UnTracked files a.k.a UnTracked files



Staged - Those that are moved to staging area/ Added to index
Tracked - modified files
UnTracked - new files. Always unstaged. If staged, that means they are tracked.


What each commands do:


git checkout . - Removes Unstaged Tracked files ONLY [Type 2]
git clean -f - Removes Unstaged UnTracked files ONLY [Type 3]
git reset --hard - Removes Staged Tracked and UnStaged Tracked files ONLY[Type 1, Type 2]
git stash -u - Removes all changes [Type 1, Type 2, Type 3]


Conclusion:

It's clear that we can use either 

(1) combination of `git clean -f` and `git reset --hard` 


OR

(2) `git stash -u`


to achieve the desired result.

Note: Stashing, as the word means 'Store (something) safely and secretly in a specified place.' This can always be retrieved using git stash pop.
So choosing between the above two options is developer's call.

Thank you Christoph and Frederik Schøning.

Edit: 03/27

I thought it's worth putting the 'beware' note to git clean -f

git clean -f

There is no going back. Use -n or --dry-run to preview the damage you'll do.

If you want to also remove directories, run git clean -f -d

If you just want to remove ignored files, run git clean -f -X

If you want to remove ignored as well as non-ignored files, run git clean -f -x

2561,600293,"How to check if a number is a power of 2

Today I needed a simple algorithm for checking if a number is a power of 2.
The algorithm needs to be:

Simple
Correct for any ulong value.

I came up with this simple algorithm:
private bool IsPowerOfTwo(ulong number)
{
    if (number == 0)
        return false;

    for (ulong power = 1; power > 0; power = power << 1)
    {
        // This for loop used shifting for powers of 2, meaning
        // that the value will become 0 after the last shift
        // (from binary 1000...0000 to 0000...0000) then, the 'for'
        // loop will break out.

        if (power == number)
            return true;
        if (power > number)
            return false;
    }
    return false;
}

But then I thought: How about checking if log2 x is an exactly a round number? When I checked for 2^63+1, Math.Log() returned exactly 63 because of rounding. So I checked if 2 to the power 63 is equal to the original number and it is, because the calculation is done in doubles and not in exact numbers.
private bool IsPowerOfTwo_2(ulong number)
{
    double log = Math.Log(number, 2);
    double pow = Math.Pow(2, Math.Round(log));
    return pow == number;
}

This returned true for the given wrong value: 9223372036854775809.

I have been heavily relying on CSS for a website that I am working on. Right now, all the CSS styles are being applied on a per tag basis, and so now I am trying to move it to more of an external styling to help with any future changes.

But now the problem is that I have noticed I am getting a ""CSS Explosion"".  It is becoming difficult for me to decide how to best organize and abstract data within the CSS file.

I am using a large number of div tags within the website, moving from a heavily table-based website.  So I'm getting a lot of CSS selectors that look like this:

div.title {
  background-color: blue;
  color: white;

My ultimate goal is to make it easy to use the CSS files and demonstrate their power to increase the speed of web development.

2618,8389648,"How do I achieve the theoretical maximum of 4 FLOPs per cycle?

How can the theoretical peak performance of 4 floating point operations (double precision) per cycle be achieved on a modern x86-64 Intel CPU?
As far as I understand it takes three cycles for an SSE add and five cycles for a mul to complete on most of the modern Intel CPUs (see for example Agner Fog's 'Instruction Tables' ). Due to pipelining, one can get a throughput of one add per cycle, if the algorithm has at least three independent summations. Since that is true for both packed addpd as well as the scalar addsd versions and SSE registers can contain two double's, the throughput can be as much as two flops per cycle.
Furthermore, it seems (although I've not seen any proper documentation on this) add's and mul's can be executed in parallel giving a theoretical max throughput of four flops per cycle.
However, I've not been able to replicate that performance with a simple C/C++ programme. My best attempt resulted in about 2.7 flops/cycle. If anyone can contribute a simple C/C++ or assembler programme which demonstrates peak performance, that'd be greatly appreciated.
My attempt:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <sys/time.h>

double stoptime(void) {
   struct timeval t;
   gettimeofday(&t,NULL);
   return (double) t.tv_sec + t.tv_usec/1000000.0;
}

double addmul(double add, double mul, int ops){
   // Need to initialise differently otherwise compiler might optimise away
   double sum1=0.1, sum2=-0.1, sum3=0.2, sum4=-0.2, sum5=0.0;
   double mul1=1.0, mul2= 1.1, mul3=1.2, mul4= 1.3, mul5=1.4;
   int loops=ops/10;          // We have 10 floating point operations inside the loop
   double expected = 5.0*add*loops + (sum1+sum2+sum3+sum4+sum5)
               + pow(mul,loops)*(mul1+mul2+mul3+mul4+mul5);

   for (int i=0; i<loops; i++) {
      mul1*=mul; mul2*=mul; mul3*=mul; mul4*=mul; mul5*=mul;
      sum1+=add; sum2+=add; sum3+=add; sum4+=add; sum5+=add;
   }
   return  sum1+sum2+sum3+sum4+sum5+mul1+mul2+mul3+mul4+mul5 - expected;
}

   if (argc != 2) {
      printf(""usage: %s <num>\n"", argv[0]);

      exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
   }
   int n = atoi(argv[1]) * 1000000;
   if (n<=0)
       n=1000;

   double y = 1.0 + 1e-8;
   double t = stoptime();
   x = addmul(x, y, n);
   t = stoptime() - t;
   printf(""addmul:\t %.3f s, %.3f Gflops, res=%f\n"", t, (double)n/t/1e9, x);
   return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}

Compiled with:
g++ -O2 -march=native addmul.cpp ; ./a.out 1000

produces the following output on an Intel Core i5-750, 2.66 GHz:
addmul:  0.270 s, 3.707 Gflops, res=1.326463

That is, just about 1.4 flops per cycle. Looking at the assembler code with
g++ -S -O2 -march=native -masm=intel addmul.cpp the main loop seems kind of
optimal to me.
.L4:
inc    eax
mulsd    xmm8, xmm3
mulsd    xmm7, xmm3
mulsd    xmm6, xmm3
mulsd    xmm5, xmm3
mulsd    xmm1, xmm3
addsd    xmm13, xmm2
addsd    xmm12, xmm2
addsd    xmm11, xmm2
addsd    xmm10, xmm2
addsd    xmm9, xmm2
cmp    eax, ebx
jne    .L4

Changing the scalar versions with packed versions (addpd and mulpd) would double the flop count without changing the execution time and so I'd get just short of 2.8 flops per cycle. Is there a simple example which achieves four flops per cycle?
Nice little programme by Mysticial; here are my results (run just for a few seconds though):

gcc -O2 -march=nocona: 5.6 Gflops out of 10.66 Gflops (2.1 flops/cycle)
cl /O2, openmp removed: 10.1 Gflops out of 10.66 Gflops (3.8 flops/cycle)

It all seems a bit complex, but my conclusions so far:

gcc -O2 changes the order of independent floating point operations with
the aim of alternating
addpd and mulpd's if possible. Same applies to gcc-4.6.2 -O2 -march=core2.

gcc -O2 -march=nocona seems to keep the order of floating point operations as defined in
the C++ source.

cl /O2, the 64-bit compiler from the
SDK for Windows 7
does loop-unrolling automatically and seems to try and arrange operations
so that groups of three addpd's alternate with three mulpd's (well, at least on my system and for my simple programme).

My Core i5 750 (Nehalem architecture)
doesn't like alternating add's and mul's and seems unable
to run both operations in parallel. However, if grouped in 3's, it suddenly works like magic.

Other architectures (possibly Sandy Bridge and others) appear to
be able to execute add/mul in parallel without problems
if they alternate in the assembly code.

Although difficult to admit, but on my system cl /O2 does a much better job at low-level optimising operations for my system and achieves close to peak performance for the little C++ example above. I measured between
1.85-2.01 flops/cycle (have used clock() in Windows which is not that precise. I guess, need to use a better timer - thanks Mackie Messer).

The best I managed  with gcc was to manually loop unroll and arrange
additions and multiplications in groups of three. With
g++ -O2 -march=nocona  addmul_unroll.cpp
I get at best 0.207s, 4.825 Gflops which corresponds to 1.8 flops/cycle
which I'm quite happy with now.


In the C++ code I've replaced the for loop with:
   for (int i=0; i<loops/3; i++) {
       mul1*=mul; mul2*=mul; mul3*=mul;
       sum1+=add; sum2+=add; sum3+=add;
       mul4*=mul; mul5*=mul; mul1*=mul;
       sum4+=add; sum5+=add; sum1+=add;

       mul2*=mul; mul3*=mul; mul4*=mul;
       sum2+=add; sum3+=add; sum4+=add;
       mul5*=mul; mul1*=mul; mul2*=mul;
       sum5+=add; sum1+=add; sum2+=add;

       mul3*=mul; mul4*=mul; mul5*=mul;
       sum3+=add; sum4+=add; sum5+=add;
   }

And the assembly now looks like:
.L4:
mulsd    xmm8, xmm3
mulsd    xmm7, xmm3
mulsd    xmm6, xmm3
addsd    xmm13, xmm2
addsd    xmm12, xmm2
addsd    xmm11, xmm2
mulsd    xmm5, xmm3
mulsd    xmm1, xmm3
mulsd    xmm8, xmm3
addsd    xmm10, xmm2
addsd    xmm9, xmm2
addsd    xmm13, xmm2

I'm designing an HTTP-based API for an intranet app. I realize it's a pretty small concern in the grand scheme of things, but: should I use hyphens, underscores, or camelCase to delimit words in the URIs?

Here are my initial thoughts:
camelCase

possible issues if server is case-insensitive

Hyphen

more aesthetically pleasing than the other alternatives
seems to be widely used in the path portion of the URI
never seen hyphenated query string key in the wild
possibly better for SEO (this may be a myth)

Underscore

potentially easier for programming languages to handle

2627,32414,"How can I force clients to refresh JavaScript files?

We are currently working in a private beta and so are still in the process of making fairly rapid changes, although obviously as usage is starting to ramp up, we will be slowing down this process.  That being said, one issue we are running into is that after we push out an update with new JavaScript files, the client browsers still use the cached version of the file and they do not see the update.  Obviously, on a support call, we can simply inform them to do a ctrlF5 refresh to ensure that they get the up-to-date files from the server, but it would be preferable to handle this before that time.

Our current thought is to simply attach a version number onto the name of the JavaScript files and then when changes are made, increment the version on the script and update all references.  This definitely gets the job done, but updating the references on each release could get cumbersome.

As I'm sure we're not the first ones to deal with this, I figured I would throw it out to the community.  How are you ensuring clients update their cache when you update your code?  If you're using the method described above, are you using a process that simplifies the change?

2637,6550700,"Inversion of Control vs Dependency Injection

According to the paper written by Martin Fowler, inversion of control is the principle where the control flow of a program is inverted: instead of the programmer controlling the flow of a program, the external sources (framework, services, other components) take control of it. It's like we plug something into something else. He mentioned an example about EJB 2.0:


  For example the Session Bean interface
  defines ejbRemove, ejbPassivate
  (stored to secondary storage), and
  ejbActivate (restored from passive
  state). You don't get to control when
  these methods are called, just what
  they do. The container calls us, we
  don't call it.


This leads to the difference between framework and library:


  Inversion of Control is a key part of
  what makes a framework different to a
  library. A library is essentially a
  set of functions that you can call,
  these days usually organized into
  classes. Each call does some work and
  returns control to the client.


I think, the point of view that DI is IOC, means the dependency of an object is inverted: instead of it controlling its own dependencies, life cycle... something else does it for you. But, as you told me about DI by hands, DI is not necessarily IOC. We can still have DI and no IOC.

However, in this paper (from the pococapsule, another IOC Framework for C/C++), it suggests that because of IOC and DI, the IOC containers and DI frameworks are far more superior to J2EE, since J2EE mixes the framework code into the components, thus not making it Plain Old Java/C++ Object (POJO/POCO).

Inversion of Control Containers other than the Dependency Injection pattern (Archive link)

Additional reading to understand what's the problem with old Component-Based Development Framework, which leads to the second paper above: Why and what of Inversion of Control (Archive link)

My Question: What exactly is IOC and DI? I am confused. Based on pococapsule, IOC is something more significant than just inversion of the control between objects or programmers and frameworks.

2643,18410035,"Ways to iterate over a list in Java

Being somewhat new to the Java language I'm trying to familiarize myself with all the ways (or at least the non-pathological ones) that one might iterate through a list (or perhaps other collections) and the advantages or disadvantages of each. 

Given a List<E> list object, I know of the following ways to loop through all elements:

Basic for loop (of course, there're equivalent while / do while loops as well)

// Not recommended (see below)!
for (int i = 0; i < list.size(); i++) {
    E element = list.get(i);
    // 1 - can call methods of element
    // 2 - can use 'i' to make index-based calls to methods of list

    // ...
}


Note: As @amarseillan pointed out, this form is a poor choice
for iterating over Lists, because the actual implementation of
the get method may not be as efficient as when using an Iterator.
For example, LinkedList implementations must traverse all of
the elements preceding i to get the i-th element.

In the above example there's no way for the List implementation to
""save its place"" to make future iterations more efficient. 
For an ArrayList it doesn't really matter, because the complexity/cost of get is constant time (O(1)) whereas for a LinkedList is it proportional to the size of the list (O(n)). 

For more information about the computational complexity of the built-in Collections implementations, check out this question.

Enhanced for loop (nicely explained in this question)

for (E element : list) {
    // 1 - can call methods of element

    // ...
}


Iterator

for (Iterator<E> iter = list.iterator(); iter.hasNext(); ) {
    E element = iter.next();
    // 1 - can call methods of element
    // 2 - can use iter.remove() to remove the current element from the list

    // ...
}


ListIterator

for (ListIterator<E> iter = list.listIterator(); iter.hasNext(); ) {
    E element = iter.next();
    // 1 - can call methods of element
    // 2 - can use iter.remove() to remove the current element from the list
    // 3 - can use iter.add(...) to insert a new element into the list
    //     between element and iter->next()
    // 4 - can use iter.set(...) to replace the current element

    // ...
}


Functional Java

list.stream().map(e -> e + 1); // Can apply a transformation function for e


Iterable.forEach, Stream.forEach, ...

(A map method from Java 8's Stream API (see @i_am_zero's answer).)

In Java 8 collection classes that implement Iterable (for example, all Lists) now have a forEach method, which can be used instead of the for loop statement demonstrated above. (Here is another question that provides a good comparison.)

Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4).forEach(System.out::println);
// 1 - can call methods of an element
// 2 - would need reference to containing object to remove an item
//     (TODO: someone please confirm / deny this)
// 3 - functionally separates iteration from the action
//     being performed with each item.

Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4).stream().forEach(System.out::println);
// Same capabilities as above plus potentially greater
// utilization of parallelism
// (caution: consequently, order of execution is not guaranteed,
// see [Stream.forEachOrdered][stream-foreach-ordered] for more
// information about this).


What other ways are there, if any?

(BTW, my interest does not stem at all from a desire to optimize performance; I just want to know what forms are available to me as a developer.)

2647,881473,"Why catch and rethrow an exception in C#?

I'm looking at the article C# - Data Transfer Object on serializable DTOs.

The article includes this piece of code:

public static string SerializeDTO(DTO dto) {
    try {
        XmlSerializer xmlSer = new XmlSerializer(dto.GetType());
        StringWriter sWriter = new StringWriter();
        xmlSer.Serialize(sWriter, dto);
        return sWriter.ToString();
    }
    catch(Exception ex) {
        throw ex;
    }
}


The rest of the article looks sane and reasonable (to a noob), but that try-catch-throw throws a WtfException... Isn't this exactly equivalent to not handling exceptions at all?

Ergo:

public static string SerializeDTO(DTO dto) {
    XmlSerializer xmlSer = new XmlSerializer(dto.GetType());
    StringWriter sWriter = new StringWriter();
    xmlSer.Serialize(sWriter, dto);
    return sWriter.ToString();
}


Or am I missing something fundamental about error handling in C#? It's pretty much the same as Java (minus checked exceptions), isn't it? ... That is, they both refined C++.

The Stack Overflow question The difference between re-throwing parameter-less catch and not doing anything? seems to support my contention that try-catch-throw is-a no-op.



EDIT:

Just to summarise for anyone who finds this thread in future...

DO NOT

try {
    // Do stuff that might throw an exception
}
catch (Exception e) {
    throw e; // This destroys the strack trace information!
}


The stack trace information can be crucial to identifying the root cause of the problem!

DO

try {
    // Do stuff that might throw an exception
}
catch (SqlException e) {
    // Log it
    if (e.ErrorCode != NO_ROW_ERROR) { // filter out NoDataFound.
        // Do special cleanup, like maybe closing the ""dirty"" database connection.
        throw; // This preserves the stack trace
    }
}
catch (IOException e) {
    // Log it
    throw;
}
catch (Exception e) {
    // Log it
    throw new DAOException(""Excrement occurred"", e); // wrapped & chained exceptions (just like java).
}
finally {
    // Normal clean goes here (like closing open files).
}


Catch the more specific exceptions before the less specific ones (just like Java).

I can extract the single line involved out to a method by itself and add @SuppressWarnings(""unchecked"") to that method, thus limiting the impact of having a block of code where I ignore warnings.  Any better options?  I don't want to turn these warnings off in Eclipse.

Before I came to the code, it was simpler, but still provoked warnings:

HashMap getItems(javax.servlet.http.HttpSession session) {
  HashMap theHash = (HashMap)session.getAttribute(""attributeKey"");
  return theHash;
}


Problem was elsewhere when you tried to use the hash you'd get warnings:

HashMap items = getItems(session);
items.put(""this"", ""that"");

Type safety: The method put(Object, Object) belongs to the raw type HashMap.  References to generic type HashMap<K,V> should be parameterized.

I'm quite familiar with Django, but I recently noticed there exists an on_delete=models.CASCADE option with the models. I have searched for the documentation for the same, but I couldn't find anything more than:

Changed in Django 1.9:
on_delete can now be used as the second positional argument (previously it was typically only passed as a keyword argument). It will be a required argument in Django 2.0.

An example case of usage is:
from django.db import models

class Car(models.Model):

        'Manufacturer',
        on_delete=models.CASCADE,

2677,19109912,"YAML: Do I need quotes for strings in YAML?

I am trying to write a YAML dictionary for internationalisation of a Rails project. I am a little confused though, as in some files I see strings in double-quotes and in some without. A few points to consider:

example 1 - all strings use double quotes;
example 2 - no strings (except the last two) use quotes;
the YAML cookbook says: Enclosing strings in double quotes allows you to use escaping to represent ASCII and Unicode characters. Does this mean I need to use double quotes only when I want to escape some characters? If yes - why do they use double quotes everywhere in the first example - only for the sake of unity / stylistic reasons?
the last two lines of example 2 use ! - the non-specific tag, while the last two lines of the first example don't - and they both work.

My question is: what are the rules for using the different types of quotes in YAML?
Could it be said that:

in general, you don't need quotes;
if you want to escape characters use double quotes;
use ! with single quotes, when... ?!?

jerry.addFriend(""quacker"", new Duck());

((Dog) jerry.callFriend(""spike"")).bark();
((Duck) jerry.callFriend(""quacker"")).quack();

If I throw a JavaScript exception myself (eg, throw ""AArrggg""), how can I get the stack trace (in Firebug or otherwise)?  Right now I just get the message.

edit: As many people below have posted, it is possible to get a stack trace for a JavaScript exception but I want to get a stack trace for my exceptions.  For example:

2715,1064271,"ASP.NET MVC - Set custom IIdentity or IPrincipal

I need to do something fairly simple: in my ASP.NET MVC application, I want to set a custom IIdentity / IPrincipal. Whichever is easier / more suitable. I want to extend the default so that I can call something like User.Identity.Id and User.Identity.Role. Nothing fancy, just some extra properties.

I've read tons of articles and questions but I feel like I'm making it harder than it actually is. I thought it would be easy. If a user logs on, I want to set a custom IIdentity. So I thought, I will implement Application_PostAuthenticateRequest in my global.asax. However, that is called on every request, and I don't want to do a call to the database on every request which would request all the data from the database and put in a custom IPrincipal object. That also seems very unnecessary, slow, and in the wrong place (doing database calls there) but I could be wrong. Or where else would that data come from?

So I thought, whenever a user logs in, I can add some necessary variables in my session, which I add to the custom IIdentity in the Application_PostAuthenticateRequest event handler. However, my Context.Session is null there, so that is also not the way to go.

I've been working on this for a day now and I feel I'm missing something. This shouldn't be too hard to do, right? I'm also a bit confused by all the (semi)related stuff that comes with this. MembershipProvider, MembershipUser, RoleProvider, ProfileProvider, IPrincipal, IIdentity, FormsAuthentication.... Am I the only one who finds all this very confusing?

If someone could tell me a simple, elegant, and efficient solution to store some extra data on a IIdentity without all the extra fuzz.. that would be great! I know there are similar questions on SO but if the answer I need is in there, I must've overlooked.

2721,10787766,"When should I really use noexcept?

The noexcept keyword can be appropriately applied to many function signatures, but I am unsure as to when I should consider using it in practice. Based on what I have read so far, the last-minute addition of noexcept seems to address some important issues that arise when move constructors throw. However, I am still unable to provide satisfactory answers to some practical questions that led me to read more about noexcept in the first place.

There are many examples of functions that I know will never throw, but for which the compiler cannot determine so on its own. Should I append noexcept to the function declaration in all such cases?
Having to think about whether or not I need to append noexcept after every function declaration would greatly reduce programmer productivity (and frankly, would be a pain in the neck). For which situations should I be more careful about the use of noexcept, and for which situations can I get away with the implied noexcept(false)?

When can I realistically expect to observe a performance improvement after using noexcept? In particular, give an example of code for which a C++ compiler is able to generate better machine code after the addition of noexcept.
Personally, I care about noexcept because of the increased freedom provided to the compiler to safely apply certain kinds of optimizations. Do modern compilers take advantage of noexcept in this way? If not, can I expect some of them to do so in the near future?

2726,7267760,"How can a time function exist in functional programming?

I've to admit that I don't know much about functional programming. I read about it from here and there, and so came to know that in functional programming, a function returns the same output, for same input, no matter how many times the function is called. It's exactly like a mathematical function which evaluates to the same output for the same value of the input parameters which involves in the function expression.

For example, consider this:

f(x,y) = x*x + y; // It is a mathematical function


No matter how many times you use f(10,4), its value will always be 104. As such, wherever you've written f(10,4), you can replace it with 104, without altering the value of the whole expression. This property is referred to as referential transparency of an expression.

As Wikipedia says (link),


  Conversely, in functional code, the output value of a function depends only on the arguments that are input to the function, so calling a function f twice with the same value for an argument x will produce the same result f(x) both times.


Can a time function (which returns the current time) exist in functional programming?


If yes, then how can it exist? Does it not violate the principle of functional programming? It particularly violates referential transparency which is one of the property of functional programming (if I correctly understand it).
Or if no, then how can one know the current time in functional programming?

What this looks like is on the left and what I want it to look like is on the right.



The obvious answer is to set the TextView to fill_parent on height, but this causes no room to be left for the button or entry field.

Essentially the issue is that I want the submit button and the text entry to be a fixed height at the bottom and the text view to fill the rest of the space. Similarly, in the horizontal linear layout I want the submit button to wrap its content and for the text entry to fill the rest of the space.

If the first item in a linear layout is told to fill_parent it does exactly that, leaving no room for other items. How do I get an item which is first in a linear layout to fill all space apart from the minimum required by the rest of the items in the layout?

2738,5560248,"Programmatically Lighten or Darken a hex color (or rgb, and blend colors)

Here is a function I was working on to programmatically lighten or darken a hex color by a specific amount. Just pass in a string like ""3F6D2A"" for the color (col) and a base10 integer (amt) for the amount to lighten or darken. To darken, pass in a negative number (i.e. -20).
The reason for me to do this was because of all the solutions I found, thus far, they seemed to over-complicate the issue. And I had a feeling it could be done with just a couple lines of code. Please let me know if you find any problems, or have any adjustments to make that would speed it up.


function LightenDarkenColor(col, amt) {
  col = parseInt(col, 16);
  return (((col & 0x0000FF) + amt) | ((((col >> 8) & 0x00FF) + amt) << 8) | (((col >> 16) + amt) << 16)).toString(16);
}


// TEST
console.log( LightenDarkenColor(""3F6D2A"",40) );



For Development use here is an easier to read version:


function LightenDarkenColor(col, amt) {
  var num = parseInt(col, 16);
  var r = (num >> 16) + amt;
  var b = ((num >> 8) & 0x00FF) + amt;
  var g = (num & 0x0000FF) + amt;
  var newColor = g | (b << 8) | (r << 16);
  return newColor.toString(16);
}


// TEST
console.log(LightenDarkenColor(""3F6D2A"", -40));



And finally a version to handle colors that may (or may not) have the ""#"" in the beginning. Plus adjusting for improper color values:
function LightenDarkenColor(col,amt) {
    var usePound = false;
    if ( col[0] == ""#"" ) {
        col = col.slice(1);
        usePound = true;
    }

    var num = parseInt(col,16);

    var r = (num >> 16) + amt;

    if ( r > 255 ) r = 255;
    else if  (r < 0) r = 0;

    var b = ((num >> 8) & 0x00FF) + amt;

    if ( b > 255 ) b = 255;
    else if  (b < 0) b = 0;
    
    var g = (num & 0x0000FF) + amt;

    if ( g > 255 ) g = 255;
    else if  ( g < 0 ) g = 0;

    return (usePound?""#"":"""") + (g | (b << 8) | (r << 16)).toString(16);
}

OK, so now it's not just a couple of lines, but it seems far simpler and if you're not using the ""#"" and don't need to check for colors out of range, it is only a couple of lines.
If not using the ""#"", you can just add it in code like:
var myColor = ""3F6D2A"";
myColor = LightenDarkenColor(myColor,10);
thePlaceTheColorIsUsed = (""#"" + myColor);

I guess my main question is, am I correct here? Does this not encompass most (normal) situations? And if so, what is the fastest and smallest way to do this? I want to use in animations and in a small environment, so speed is the first most important factor here, size second, accuracy third, readability? huh? not on the list of requirements (sorry, I know half of you are tearing out your eyes right now!).

Note - The red circled items in Model #1 are the fields I use to ""map"" to Model #2.  Please ignore the red circles in Model #2: that is from another question I had which is now answered.

Note:  I still need to put in an isDeleted check so I can soft delete it from DB1 if it has gone out of our client's inventory.

All I want to do, with this particular code, is connect a company in DB1 with a client in DB2, get their product list from DB2 and INSERT it in DB1 if it is not already there.  First time through should be a full pull of inventory.  Each time it is run there after nothing should happen unless new inventory came in on the feed over night.


  So the big question - how to I solve the transaction error I am getting?  Do I need to drop and recreate my context each time through the loops (does not make sense to me)?

2763,241339,"When to use static classes in C#

static class CompanyInfo
{
    public static string GetCompanyName() { return ""CompanyName""; }
    public static string GetCompanyAddress() { return ""CompanyAddress""; }
    //...
}

  
  Use a static class as a unit of
  organization for methods not
  associated with particular objects.
  Also, a static class can make your
  implementation simpler and faster
  because you do not have to create an
  object in order to call its methods.
  It is useful to organize the methods
  inside the class in a meaningful way,
  such as the methods of the Math class
  in the System namespace.


To me, that example doesn't seem to cover very many possible usage scenarios for static classes. In the past I've used static classes for stateless suites of related functions, but that's about it. So, under what circumstances should (and shouldn't) a class be declared static?

2764,544993,"Official way to ask jQuery wait for all images to load before executing something

In jQuery when you do this:

$(function() {
   alert(""DOM is loaded, but images not necessarily all loaded"");
});


It waits for the DOM to load and executes your code. If all the images are not loaded then it still executes the code. This is obviously what we want if we're initializing any DOM stuff such as showing or hiding elements or attaching events.

Let's say though that I want some animation and I don't want it running until all the images are loaded. Is there an official way in jQuery to do this?

The best way I have is to use <body onload=""finished()"">, but I don't really want to do that unless I have to.

Note: There is a bug in jQuery 1.3.1 in Internet Explorer which actually does wait for all images to load before executing code inside $function() { }. So if you're using that platform you'll get the behavior I'm looking for instead of the correct behavior described above.

2778,2850369,"Why does git perform fast-forward merges by default?

Coming from mercurial, I use branches to organize features.
Naturally, I want to see this work-flow in my history as well.

I started my new project using git and finished my first feature. When merging the feature, I realized git uses fast-forward, i.e. it applies my changes directly to the master branch if possible and forgets about my branch.

So to think into the future: I'm the only one working on this project. If I use git's default approach (fast-forward merging), my history would result in one giant master branch.
Nobody knows I used a separate branch for every feature, because in the end I'll have only that giant master branch. Won't that look unprofessional?

By this reasoning, I don't want fast-forward merging and can't see why it is the default. What's so good about it?

2785,83073,"Why not use tables for layout in HTML?

It seems to be the general opinion that tables should not be used for layout in HTML. 

Why?

I have never (or rarely to be honest) seen good arguments for this. The usual answers are:


It's good to separate content from layoutBut this is a fallacious argument; Cliche Thinking. I guess it's true that using the table element for layout has little to do with tabular data. So what? Does my boss care? Do my users care?Perhaps me or my fellow developers who have to maintain a web page care... Is a table less maintainable? I think using a table is easier than using divs and CSS.By the way... why is using a div or a span good separation of content from layout and a table not? Getting a good layout with only divs often requires a lot of nested divs.
Readability of the codeI think it's the other way around. Most people understand HTML, few understand CSS.
It's better for SEO not to use tablesWhy? Can anybody show some evidence that it is? Or a statement from Google that tables are discouraged from an SEO perspective?
Tables are slower.An extra tbody element has to be inserted. This is peanuts for modern web browsers. Show me some benchmarks where the use of a table significantly slows down a page.
A layout overhaul is easier without tables, see css Zen Garden.Most web sites that need an upgrade need new content (HTML) as well. Scenarios where a new version of a web site only needs a new CSS file are not very likely. Zen Garden is a nice web site, but a bit theoretical. Not to mention its misuse of CSS.


I am really interested in good arguments to use divs + CSS instead of tables.

To overcome this I load data on different thread (trying to change existing code as little as I can)
I used a background worker thread which will be loading the data and when done will notify the application that it has done its work.
Now came a real problem. All the UI (main form and its child usercontrols) was created on the primary main thread. In the LOAD method of the usercontrol I'm fetching data based on the values of some control (like textbox) on userControl.

The pseudocode would look like this:
CODE 1
UserContrl1_LoadDataMethod()
{
    if (textbox1.text == ""MyName"") // This gives exception
    {
        //Load data corresponding to ""MyName"".
        //Populate a globale variable List<string> which will be binded to grid at some later stage.
    }
}

The Exception it gave was

Cross-thread operation not valid: Control accessed from a thread other than the thread it was created on.

To know more about this I did some googling and a suggestion came up like using the following code
CODE 2
UserContrl1_LoadDataMethod()
{
    if (InvokeRequired) // Line #1
    {
        this.Invoke(new MethodInvoker(UserContrl1_LoadDataMethod));
        return;
    }

    if (textbox1.text == ""MyName"") // Now it won't give an exception
    {
    //Load data correspondin to ""MyName""
        //Populate a globale variable List<string> which will be binded to grid at some later stage
    }
}

But it still seems that I've come back to square one. The Application again
becomes unresponsive. It seems to be due to the execution of line #1 if condition. The loading task is again done by the parent thread and not the third that I spawned.
I don't know whether I perceived this right or wrong.
How do I resolve this and also what is the effect of execution of Line#1 if block?
The situation is this: I want to load data into a global variable based on the value of a control. I don't want to change the value of a control from the child thread. I'm not going to do it ever from a child thread.
So only accessing the value so that the corresponding data can be fetched from the database.

2827,2573135,"Python progression path - From apprentice to guru

I've been learning, working, and playing with Python for a year and a half now. As a biologist slowly making the turn to bio-informatics, this language has been at the very core of all the major contributions I have made in the lab. I more or less fell in love with the way Python permits me to express beautiful solutions and also with the semantics of the language that allows such a natural flow from thoughts to workable code.

What I would like to know is your answer to a kind of question I have seldom seen in this or other forums. This question seems central to me for anyone on the path to Python improvement but who wonders what his next steps should be.

Let me sum up what I do NOT want to ask first ;)


I don't want to know how to QUICKLY learn Python
Nor do I want to find out the best way to get acquainted with the language
Finally, I don't want to know a 'one trick that does it all' approach.


What I do want to know your opinion about, is:

What are the steps YOU would recommend to a Python journeyman, from apprenticeship to guru status (feel free to stop wherever your expertise dictates it), in order that one IMPROVES CONSTANTLY, becoming a better and better Python coder, one step at a time. Some of the people on SO almost seem worthy of worship for their Python prowess, please enlighten us :)

The kind of answers I would enjoy (but feel free to surprise the readership :P ), is formatted more or less like this:


Read this (eg: python tutorial), pay attention to that kind of details
Code for so manytime/problems/lines of code
Then, read this (eg: this or that book), but this time, pay attention to this
Tackle a few real-life problems
Then, proceed to reading Y.
Be sure to grasp these concepts
Code for X time
Come back to such and such basics or move further to...
(you get the point :)


I really care about knowing your opinion on what exactly one should pay attention to, at various stages, in order to progress CONSTANTLY (with due efforts, of course). If you come from a specific field of expertise, discuss the path you see as appropriate in this field.

EDIT: Thanks to your great input, I'm back on the Python improvement track! I really appreciate!

2836,301134,"How can I import a module dynamically given its name as string?

I'm writing a Python application that takes a command as an argument, for example:
$ python myapp.py command1

I want the application to be extensible, that is, to be able to add new modules that implement new commands without having to change the main application source. The tree looks something like:
myapp/
    __init__.py
    commands/
        __init__.py
        command1.py
        command2.py
    foo.py
    bar.py

So I want the application to find the available command modules at runtime and execute the appropriate one.
Python defines an __import__() function, which takes a string for a module name:

__import__(name, globals=None, locals=None, fromlist=(), level=0)
The function imports the module name, potentially using the given globals and locals to determine how to interpret the name in a package context. The fromlist gives the names of objects or submodules that should be imported from the module given by name.
Source: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#__import__

So currently I have something like:
command = sys.argv[1]
try:
    command_module = __import__(""myapp.commands.%s"" % command, fromlist=[""myapp.commands""])
except ImportError:
    # Display error message

command_module.run()

This works just fine, I'm just wondering if there is possibly a more idiomatic way to accomplish what we are doing with this code.
Note that I specifically don't want to get in to using eggs or extension points. This is not an open-source project and I don't expect there to be ""plugins"". The point is to simplify the main application code and remove the need to modify it each time a new command module is added.

To make my question more specific, I am writing an application that deals with data and the specification say that there should be a 'reset' button that brings the application back to its original just launched state. However, all data have to be 'live' unless the application is closed or reset button is pressed.

Being usually a C/C++ programmer, I thought this would be trivial to implement. (And hence I planned to implement it last.) I structured my program such that all the 'reset-able' objects would be in the same class so that I can just destroy all 'live' objects when a reset button is pressed.

I was thinking if all I did was just to dereference the data and wait for the garbage collector to collect them, wouldn't there be a memory leak if my user repeatedly entered data and pressed the reset button? I was also thinking since Java is quite mature as a language, there should be a way to prevent this from happening or gracefully tackle this.

2867,2281633,"JavaScript isset() equivalent

In PHP you can do if(isset($array['foo'])) { ... }. In JavaScript you often use if(array.foo) { ... } to do the same, but this is not exactly the same statement. The condition will also evaluate to false if array.foo does exists but is false or 0 (and probably other values as well).
What is the perfect equivalent of PHP's isset in JavaScript?
In a broader sense, a general, complete guide on JavaScript's handling of variables that don't exist, variables without a value, etc. would be convenient.

Update: 11 years and 11 months ago I posted this question, and wow, it still gets a lot of activity. Now, I'm pretty sure that when I wrote this, I only wanted to know how to check for the presence of a property in an associative array (a.k.a. dictionary), and as such the correct (for me) answers involve hasOwnProperty or the in operator. I wasn't interested in checking local or global variables.
But while I remember that well, that intent is not quite clear in the question as written, or even directly contradicted by it! I never mentioned the associative array, and PHP's isset does also do those other things. Let this be a lesson to all of us about how important it is to properly state your requirements in a question, and also how global variables, local variables, object properties, dictionary keys and what-have-you aren't Huey, Dewey, and Louie.
In the meantime (heh), many many people have provided answers to that effect as well, so for those of you who found this question through Google, well, I'm glad my vagueness helped in a way I guess. Anyway, just wanted to clarify that.

I need to store a multi-dimensional associative array of data in a flat file for caching purposes. I might occasionally come across the need to convert it to JSON for use in my web app but the vast majority of the time I will be using the array directly in PHP.

Would it be more efficient to store the array as JSON or as a PHP serialized array in this text file? I've looked around and it seems that in the newest versions of PHP (5.3), json_decode is actually faster than unserialize.

I'm currently leaning towards storing the array as JSON as I feel its easier to read by a human if necessary, it can be used in both PHP and JavaScript with very little effort, and from what I've read, it might even be faster to decode (not sure about encoding, though).

Still, I am not getting how nullptr works. For example, Wikipedia article says:


  C++11 corrects this by introducing a new keyword to serve as a distinguished null pointer constant: nullptr. It is of type nullptr_t, which is implicitly convertible and comparable to any pointer type or pointer-to-member type. It is not implicitly convertible or comparable to integral types, except for bool.

2932,24718709,"ReactJS - Does render get called any time ""setState"" is called?

Does React re-render all components and sub components every time setState() is called?
If so, why? I thought the idea was that React only rendered as little as needed - when state changed.
In the following simple example, both classes render again when the text is clicked, despite the fact that the state doesn't change on subsequent clicks, as the onClick handler always sets the state to the same value:
this.setState({'test':'me'});

I would've expected that renders would only happen if state data had changed.
Here's the code of the example, as a JS Fiddle, and embedded snippet:


var TimeInChild = React.createClass({
    render: function() {
        var t = new Date().getTime();

        return (
            <p>Time in child:{t}</p>

    }

2966,1118183,"How to debug in Django, the good way?

So, I started learning to code in Python and later Django. The first times it was hard looking at tracebacks and actually figure out what I did wrong and where the syntax error was. Some time has passed now and some way along the way, I guess I got a routine in debugging my Django code. As this was done early in my coding experience, I sat down and wondered if how I was doing this was ineffective and could be done faster. I usually manage to find and correct the bugs in my code, but I wonder if I should be doing it faster?

I usually just use the debug info Django gives when enabled. When things do end up as I thought it would, I break the code flow a lot with a syntax error, and look at the variables at that point in the flow to figure out, where the code does something other than what I wanted.

3011,58123398,"When to use JSX.Element vs ReactNode vs ReactElement?

I am currently migrating a React application to TypeScript. So far, this works pretty well, but I have a problem with the return types of my render functions, specifically in my functional components.
I have always used JSX.Element as the return type, now this doesn't work any more if a component decides to not render anything, i.e. returns null, since null is not a valid value for JSX.Element. This was the beginning of my journey. I searched the web and found that you should use ReactNode instead, which includes null and a few other things that can happen.
However, when creating a functional component, TypeScript complains about the ReactNode type. Again, after some searching I found, that for functional components you should use ReactElement instead. However, if I do so, the compatibility issue is gone, but now TypeScript again complains about null not being a valid value.
To cut a long story short, I have three questions:

What is the difference between JSX.Element, ReactNode and ReactElement?
Why do the render methods of class components return ReactNode, but functional components return ReactElement?
How do I solve this with respect to null?

3022,1653046,"What are the true benefits of ExpandoObject?

For example, why is this:

dynamic obj = new ExpandoObject();
obj.MyInt = 3;
obj.MyString = ""Foo"";
Console.WriteLine(obj.MyString);


Really better, or substantially different, than:

var obj = new Dictionary<string, object>();

obj[""MyString""] = ""Foo"";

Console.WriteLine(obj[""MyString""]);

3033,2001773,"Understanding REST: Verbs, error codes, and authentication

I am looking for a way to wrap APIs around default functions in my PHP-based web applications, databases and CMSs. 

I have looked around and found several ""skeleton"" frameworks. In addition to the answers in my question, there is Tonic, a REST framework I like because it is very lightweight.

I like REST the best for its simplicity, and would like to create an API architecture based on it. I'm trying to get my head around the basic principles and have not fully understood it yet. Therefore, a number of questions.

1. Am I understanding it right?

Say I have a resource ""users"". I could set up a number of URIs like so:

/api/users     when called with GET, lists users
/api/users     when called with POST, creates user record
/api/users/1   when called with GET, shows user record
               when called with PUT, updates user record
               when called with DELETE, deletes user record


is this a correct representation of a RESTful architecture so far?

2. I need more verbs

Create, Update and Delete may be enough in theory, but in practice I will have the need for a lot more verbs. I realize these are things that could be embedded in an update request, but they are specific actions that can have specific return codes and I wouldn't want to throw them all into one action.

Some that come to mind in the user example are:

activate_login
deactivate_login
change_password
add_credit


how would I express actions such as those in a RESTful URL architecture?

My instinct would be to do a GET call to a URL like 

/api/users/1/activate_login 


and expect a status code back. 

That deviates from the idea of using HTTP verbs, though. What do you think?

3. How to return error messages and codes

A great part of REST's beauty stems from its use of standard HTTP methods. On an error, I emit a header with a 3xx,4xx or 5xx error status code. For a detailed error description, I can use the body (right?). So far so good. But what would be the way to transmit a proprietary error code that is more detailed in describing what went wrong (e.g. ""failed to connect to database"", or ""database login wrong"")? If I put it into the body along with the message, I have to parse it out afterwards. Is there a standard header for this kind of thing?

4. How to do authentication


What would a API key based authentication following REST principles look like?
Are there strong points against using sessions when authenticating a REST client, other than that it's a blatant violation of the REST principle? :) (only half kidding here, session based authentication would play well with my existing infrastructure.)

3050,520967,"SQL Server: Database stuck in ""Restoring"" state

I backed up a database:

And then tried to restore it:

RESTORE DATABASE MyDatabase

   WITH REPLACE --force restore over specified database


And now the database is stuck in the restoring state.

Some people have theorized that it's because there was no log file in the backup, and it needed to be rolled forward using:

RESTORE DATABASE MyDatabase

3051,654754,"What REALLY happens when you don't free after malloc before program termination?

We are all taught that you MUST free every pointer that is allocated.  I'm a bit curious, though, about the real cost of not freeing memory. In some obvious cases, like when malloc() is called inside a loop or part of a thread execution, it's very important to free so there are no memory leaks.  But consider the following two examples:
First, if I have code that's something like this:
int main()
{
    char *a = malloc(1024);
    /* Do some arbitrary stuff with 'a' (no alloc functions) */
    return 0;
}

What's the real result here?  My thinking is that the process dies and then the heap space is gone anyway so there's no harm in missing the call to free (however, I do recognize the importance of having it anyway for closure, maintainability, and good practice).  Am I right in this thinking?
Second, let's say I have a program that acts a bit like a shell.  Users can declare variables like aaa = 123 and those are stored in some dynamic data structure for later use.  Clearly, it seems obvious that you'd use some solution that will calls some *alloc function (hashmap, linked list, something like that).  For this kind of program, it doesn't make sense to ever free after calling malloc because these variables must be present at all times during the program's execution and there's no good way (that I can see) to implement this with statically allocated space.  Is it bad design to have a bunch of memory that's allocated but only freed as part of the process ending?  If so, what's the alternative?

Since this post has gotten a lot of attention over the years, I've listed the top solutions per platform at the bottom of this post.



Original post:

I want my node.js server to run in the background, i.e.: when I close my terminal I want my server to keep running. I've googled this and came up with this tutorial, however it doesn't work as intended. So instead of using that daemon script, I thought I just used the output redirection (the 2>&1 >> file part), but this too does not exit - I get a blank line in my terminal, like it's waiting for output/errors.

I've also tried to put the process in the background, but as soon as I close my terminal the process is killed as well.

3078,13762228,"Confused about Service vs Factory

As I understand it, when inside a factory I return an object that gets injected into a controller. When inside a service I am dealing with the object using this and not returning anything. 

I was under the assumption that a service was always a singleton, and that a new factory object gets injected in every controller. However, as it turns out, a factory object is a singleton too?

Example code to demonstrate:

var factories = angular.module('app.factories', []);
var app = angular.module('app',  ['ngResource', 'app.factories']);

factories.factory('User', function () {
  return {
    first: 'John',
    last: 'Doe'
  };
});

app.controller('ACtrl', function($scope, User) {
  $scope.user = User;
});

app.controller('BCtrl', function($scope, User) {
  $scope.user = User;
});

My assumption was that a new instance was injected in a controller with a factory?

3079,26739167,"JWT (JSON Web Token) automatic prolongation of expiration

I would like to implement JWT-based authentication to our new REST API. But since the expiration is set in the token, is it possible to automatically prolong it? I don't want users to need to sign in after every X minutes if they were actively using the application in that period. That would be a huge UX fail.
But prolonging the expiration creates a new token (and the old one is still valid until it expires). And generating a new token after each request sounds silly to me. Sounds like a security issue when more than one token is valid at the same time. Of course I could invalidate the old used one using a blacklist but I would need to store the tokens. And one of the benefits of JWT is no storage.
I found how Auth0 solved it. They use not only JWT token but also a refresh token:
https://auth0.com/docs/tokens/refresh-tokens
But again, to implement this (without Auth0) I'd need to store refresh tokens and maintain their expiration. What is the real benefit then? Why not have only one token (not JWT) and keep the expiration on the server?

I argued a bit on this. Then he told me to try this myself at home. 

abstract class my {
    public void mymethod() {
        System.out.print(""Abstract"");
    }
}

class poly {
    public static void main(String a[]) {
        my m = new my() {};
        m.mymethod();
    }
}


Here, I'm creating instance of my class and calling method of abstract class. Can anyone please explain this to me? Was I really wrong during my interview?

3113,21198977,"Difference between Grunt, NPM, and Bower (package.json vs bower.json)

When I want to add a package (and check in the dependency into git), where does it belong - into package.json or into bower.json?
From what I gather,
running bower install will fetch the package and put it in /vendor directory,
running npm install it will fetch it and put it into /node_modules directory.
This SO answer says bower is for front-end and npm is for backend stuff.
Ember-app-kit seems to adhere to this distinction from the first glance... But instructions in gruntfile for enabling some functionality give two explicit commands, so I'm totally confused here.
Intuitively I would guess that

npm install --save-dev package-name would be equivalent to adding the package-name to my package.json

bower install --save package-name might be the same as adding the package to my bower.json and running bower install?


If that is the case, when should I ever install packages explicitly like that without adding them to the file that manages dependencies (apart from installing command line tools globally)?

3117,466521,"How many files can I put in a directory?

Does it matter how many files I keep in a single directory? If so, how many files in a directory is too many, and what are the impacts of having too many files? (This is on a Linux server.)

Background: I have a photo album website, and every image uploaded is renamed to an 8-hex-digit id (say, a58f375c.jpg).  This is to avoid filename conflicts (if lots of ""IMG0001.JPG"" files are uploaded, for example).  The original filename and any useful metadata is stored in a database.  Right now, I have somewhere around 1500 files in the images directory.  This makes listing the files in the directory (through FTP or SSH client) take a few seconds.  But I can't see that it has any effect other than that.  In particular, there doesn't seem to be any impact on how quickly an image file is served to the user.

I've thought about reducing the number of images by making 16 subdirectories: 0-9 and a-f.  Then I'd move the images into the subdirectories based on what the first hex digit of the filename was.  But I'm not sure that there's any reason to do so except for the occasional listing of the directory through FTP/SSH.

3135,5373198,"MongoDB relationships: embed or reference?

A question with some comments, like stackoverflow, would have a structure like this:
Question

At first, I thought of using embedded comments (I think embed is recommended in MongoDB), like this:

3141,619856,"Interface defining a constructor signature?

It's weird that this is the first time I've bumped into this problem, but:

How do you define a constructor in a C# interface?

Edit
Some people wanted an example (it's a free time project, so yes, it's a game)

IDrawable
 +Update
 +Draw

To be able to Update (check for edge of screen etc) and draw itself it will always need a GraphicsDeviceManager. So I want to make sure the object has a reference to it. This would belong in the constructor.

Now that I wrote this down I think what I'm implementing here is IObservable and the GraphicsDeviceManager should take the IDrawable...
It seems either I don't get the XNA framework, or the framework is not thought out very well.

Edit
There seems to be some confusion about my definition of constructor in the context of an interface. An interface can indeed not be instantiated so doesn't need a constructor. What I wanted to define was a signature to a constructor. Exactly like an interface can define a signature of a certain method, the interface could define the signature of a constructor.

3144,1365541,"How to move some files from one git repo to another (not a clone), preserving history

Our Git repositories started out as parts of a single monster SVN repository where the individual projects each had their own tree like so:

project1/branches
        /tags
        /trunk
project2/branches
        /tags
        /trunk


Obviously, it was pretty easy to move files from one to another with svn mv. But in Git, each project is in its own repository, and today I was asked to move a subdirectory from project2 to project1. I did something like this:

$ git clone project2 
$ cd project2
$ git filter-branch --subdirectory-filter deeply/buried/java/source/directory/A -- --all
$ git remote rm origin  # so I don't accidentally overwrite the repo ;-)
$ mkdir -p deeply/buried/different/java/source/directory/B
$ for f in *.java; do 
>  git mv $f deeply/buried/different/java/source/directory/B
>  done
$ git commit -m ""moved files to new subdirectory""
$ cd ..
$
$ git clone project1
$ cd project1
$ git remote add p2 ../project2
$ git fetch p2
$ git branch p2 remotes/p2/master
$ git merge p2 # --allow-unrelated-histories for git 2.9+
$ git remote rm p2
$ git push


But that seems pretty convoluted. Is there a better way to do this sort of thing in general? Or have I adopted the right approach?

Note that this involves merging the history into an existing repository, rather than simply creating a new standalone repository from part of another one (as in an earlier question).

3174,19036228,"UIScrollView Scrollable Content Size Ambiguity

Fellow devs,
I am having trouble with AutoLayout in Interface Builder (Xcode 5 / iOS 7).
It's very basic and important so I think everyone should know how this properly works. If this is a bug in Xcode, it is a critical one!

So, whenever I have a view hierarchy such as this I run into trouble:

>UIViewController
>> UIView
>>>UIScrollView
>>>>UILabel (or any other comparable UIKit Element)


The UIScrollView has solid constraints, e.g., 50 px from every side (no problem).
Then I add a Top Space constraint to the UILabel (no problem) (and I can even pin height / width of the label, changes nothing, but should be unneccessary due to the Label's intrinsic size)

The trouble starts when I add a trailing constraint to the UILabel:

E.g., Trailing Space to: Superview Equals: 25

Now two warnings occur - and I don't understand why:

A) Scrollable Content Size Ambiguity (Scroll View has ambiguous scrollable content height/width)

B) Misplaced Views (Label Expected: x= -67 Actual: x= 207

I did this minimal example in a freshly new project which you can download and I attached a screenshot. As you can see, Interface Builder expects the Label to sit outside of the UIScrollView's boundary (the orange dashed rectangle). Updating the Label's frame with the Resolve Issues Tool moves it right there.

Please note: If you replace the UIScrollView with a UIView, the behaviour is as expected (the Label's frame is correct and according to the constraint). So there seems to either be an issue with UIScrollView or I am missing out on something important.

When I run the App without updating the Label's frame as suggested by IB it is positioned just fine, exactly where it's supposed to be and the UIScrollView is scrollable.
If I DO update the frame the Label is out of sight and the UIScrollView does not scroll.

Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi! Why the ambiguous layout? Why the misplaced view?

Is there a good reason to prefer one over the other?



I accepted the most popular (and interesting) answer, but the real answer seems to be ""No, there is no good reason to prefer one over the other.""


They are equivalent (except as noted below).
Some people have reasons to always use typename.
Some people have reasons to always use class.
Some people have reasons to use both.
Some people don't care which one they use.


Note, however, that before C++17 in the case of template template parameters, use of class instead of typename was required. See user1428839's answer below. (But this particular case is not a matter of preference, it was a requirement of the language.)

3179,257288,"Templated check for the existence of a class member function?

Is it possible to write a template that changes behavior depending on if a certain member function is defined on a class?

Here's a simple example of what I would want to write:

template<class T>
std::string optionalToString(T* obj)
{
    if (FUNCTION_EXISTS(T->toString))
        return obj->toString();
    else
        return ""toString not defined"";
}


So, if class T has toString() defined, then it uses it; otherwise, it doesn't. The magical part that I don't know how to do is the ""FUNCTION_EXISTS"" part.

3180,708012,"How to declare global variables in Android?

I am creating an application which requires login. I created the main and the login activity.

In the main activity onCreate method I added the following condition:

public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.main);

    ...

    loadSettings();
    if(strSessionString == null)
    {
        login();
    }
    ...
}


The onActivityResult method which is executed when the login form terminates looks like this:

@Override
public void onActivityResult(int requestCode,
                             int resultCode,
                             Intent data)

                strUsername = data.getStringExtra(Login.USERNAME);
            }
        }
    }

Does anyone know how to set the variable global in order to avoid login form appearing after the user already successfully authenticates?

I am using Python 2.5.2. Trying some different versions of Python, it appears that Python 2.3.3 shows the above behaviour between 99 and 100.

Web applications that want to force a resource to be downloaded rather than directly rendered in a Web browser issue a Content-Disposition header in the HTTP response of the form:
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=FILENAME
The filename parameter can be used to suggest a name for the file into which the resource is downloaded by the browser. RFC 2183 (Content-Disposition), however, states in section 2.3 (The Filename Parameter) that the file name can only use US-ASCII characters:

Current [RFC 2045] grammar restricts
parameter values (and hence
Content-Disposition filenames) to
US-ASCII.  We recognize the great
desirability of allowing arbitrary
character sets in filenames, but it is
beyond the scope of this document to
define the necessary mechanisms.

There is empirical evidence, nevertheless, that most popular Web browsers today seem to permit non-US-ASCII characters yet (for the lack of a standard) disagree on the encoding scheme and character set specification of the file name. Question is then, what are the various schemes and encodings employed by the popular browsers if the file name “naïvefile” (without quotes and where the third letter is U+00EF) needed to be encoded into the Content-Disposition header?
For the purpose of this question, popular browsers being:

When using git at the command line, I am wondering if it is possible to use Visual Studio Code as the default editor, i.e. when creating commit comments and looking at a diff of a file from the command line.
I understand that it won't be possible to use it for doing merges (at least at the minute) but does anyone know if it is possible to use it for looking at diff's, and if so, what command line options would be required in the .gitconfig file to make this happen?
UPDATE 1:
I have tried an approach similar to what I have done for Notepad++ in the past, i.e.
#!/bin/sh

""c:/Program Files (x86)/Notepad++/notepad++.exe"" -multiInst -notabbar -nosession -noPlugin ""$*""

3238,31922866,"Why should Java 8's Optional not be used in arguments

I've read on many Web sites Optional should be used as a return type only, and not used in method arguments.  I'm struggling to find a logical reason why.  For example I have a piece of logic which has 2 optional parameters.  Therefore I think it would make sense to write my method signature like this (solution 1):

public int calculateSomething(Optional<String> p1, Optional<BigDecimal> p2 {
    // my logic
}


Many web pages specify Optional should not be used as method arguments. With this in mind, I could use the following method signature and add a clear Javadoc comment to specify that the arguments may be null, hoping future maintainers will read the Javadoc and therefore always carry out null checks prior to using the arguments (solution 2):

public int calculateSomething(String p1, BigDecimal p2) {
    // my logic
}


Alternatively I could replace my method with four public methods to provide a nicer interface and make it more obvious p1 and p2 are optional (solution 3):

public int calculateSomething() {
    calculateSomething(null, null);
}

public int calculateSomething(String p1) {
    calculateSomething(p1, null);
}

public int calculateSomething(BigDecimal p2) {
    calculateSomething(null, p2);
}

public int calculateSomething(String p1, BigDecimal p2) {
    // my logic
}


Now I try writing the code of the class which invokes this piece of logic for each approach.  I first retrieve the two input parameters from another object which returns Optionals and then, I invoke calculateSomething.  Therefore, if solution 1 is used the calling code would look like this:

Optional<String> p1 = otherObject.getP1();
Optional<BigInteger> p2 = otherObject.getP2();
int result = myObject.calculateSomething(p1, p2);


if solution 2 is used, the calling code would look like this:

Optional<String> p1 = otherObject.getP1();
Optional<BigInteger> p2 = otherObject.getP2();
int result = myObject.calculateSomething(p1.orElse(null), p2.orElse(null));


if solution 3 is applied, I could use the code above or I could use the following (but it's significantly more code):

Optional<String> p1 = otherObject.getP1();
Optional<BigInteger> p2 = otherObject.getP2();
int result;
if (p1.isPresent()) {
    if (p2.isPresent()) {
        result = myObject.calculateSomething(p1, p2);
    } else {
        result = myObject.calculateSomething(p1);
    }
} else {
    if (p2.isPresent()) {
        result = myObject.calculateSomething(p2);
    } else {
        result = myObject.calculateSomething();
    }
}


So my question is: Why is it considered bad practice to use Optionals as method arguments (see solution 1)?  It looks like the most readable solution to me and makes it most obvious that the parameters could be empty/null to future maintainers.  (I'm aware the designers of Optional intended it to only be used as a return type, but I can't find any logical reasons not to use it in this scenario).

3260,12578908,"Separation of business logic and data access in django

I am writing a project in Django and I see that 80% of the code is in the file models.py. This code is confusing and, after a certain time, I cease to understand what is really happening.
Here is what bothers me:

I find it ugly that my model level (which was supposed to be
responsible only for the work with data from a database) is also
sending email, walking on API to other services, etc.
Also, I find it unacceptable to place business logic in the view, because
this way it becomes difficult to control. For example, in my
application there are at least three ways to create new
instances of User, but technically it should create them uniformly.
I do not always notice when the methods and
properties of my models become non-deterministic and when they develop
side effects.

Here is a simple example. At first, the User model was like this:
class User(db.Models):

    def get_present_name(self):
        return self.name or 'Anonymous'

    def activate(self):
        self.status = 'activated'
        self.save()

Over time, it turned into this:
class User(db.Models):

    def get_present_name(self): 
        # property became non-deterministic in terms of database
        # data is taken from another service by api
        return remote_api.request_user_name(self.uid) or 'Anonymous' 

    def activate(self):
        # method now has a side effect (send message to user)
        self.status = 'activated'
        self.save()
        send_mail('Your account is activated!', '…', [self.email])

What I want is to separate entities in my code:

Database level entities, i.e. database level logic: What kind of data does my application store?
application level entities, i.e. business level logic: What does my application do?

For a new node.js project I'm working on, I'm thinking about switching over from a cookie based session approach (by this, I mean, storing an id to a key-value store containing user sessions in a user's browser) to a token-based session approach (no key-value store) using JSON Web Tokens (jwt).

The project is a game that utilizes socket.io - having a token-based session would be useful in such a scenario where there will be multiple communication channels in a single session (web and socket.io)

How would one provide token/session invalidation from the server using the jwt Approach? 

I also wanted to understand what common (or uncommon) pitfalls/attacks I should look out for with this sort of paradigm. For example, if this paradigm is vulnerable to the same/different kinds of attacks as the session store/cookie-based approach.

So, say I have the following (adapted from this and this):

Session Store Login:

app.get('/login', function(request, response) {
    var user = {username: request.body.username, password: request.body.password };
    // Validate somehow
    validate(user, function(isValid, profile) {
        // Create session token
        var token= createSessionToken();

        // Add to a key-value database
        KeyValueStore.add({token: {userid: profile.id, expiresInMinutes: 60}});

        // The client should save this session token in a cookie
        response.json({sessionToken: token});
    });
}


Token-Based Login:

var jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
app.get('/login', function(request, response) {
    var user = {username: request.body.username, password: request.body.password };
    // Validate somehow
    validate(user, function(isValid, profile) {
        var token = jwt.sign(profile, 'My Super Secret', {expiresInMinutes: 60});
        response.json({token: token});
    });
}


--

A logout (or invalidate) for the Session Store approach would require an update to the KeyValueStore 
database with the specified token.

It seems like such a mechanism would not exist in the token-based approach since the token itself would contain the info that would normally exist in the key-value store.

For systems on using AWS, you are better off using EC2 Elastic Load Balancers to handle SSL Termination, and allow regular HTTP traffic to your EC2 web servers. For further security, setup your security group such that only the ELB is allowed to send HTTP traffic to the EC2 instances, which will prevent external unencrypted HTTP traffic from hitting your machines.

I have been reading up and learning about Docker, and am trying to correctly choose the Django setup to use. So far there is either:
Docker Compose or Dockerfile

3273,967096,"Using jQuery to test if an input has focus

On the front page of a site I am building, several <div>s use the CSS :hover pseudo-class to add a border when the mouse is over them. One of the <div>s contains a <form> which, using jQuery, will keep the border if an input within it has focus. This works perfectly except that IE6 does not support :hover on any elements other than <a>s. So, for this browser only we are using jQuery to mimic CSS :hover using the $(#element).hover() method. The only problem is, now that jQuery handles both the form focus() and hover(), when an input has focus then the user moves the mouse in and out, the border goes away.

I was thinking we could use some kind of conditional to stop this behavior. For instance, if we tested on mouse out if any of the inputs had focus, we could stop the border from going away. AFAIK, there is no :focus selector in jQuery, so I'm not sure how to make this happen. Any ideas?

3274,1105990,"Is it better to call ToList() or ToArray() in LINQ queries?

I often run into the case where I want to eval a query right where I declare it. This is usually because I need to iterate over it multiple times and it is expensive to compute. For example:

var lines = (from l in raw.Split('\n')

This works fine. But if I am not going to modify the result, then I might as well call ToArray() instead of ToList().

I wonder however whether ToArray() is implemented by first calling ToList() and is therefore less memory efficient than just calling ToList().

Am I crazy? Should I just call ToArray() - safe and secure in the knowledge that the memory won't be allocated twice?

Based on the answers and the comments under the answers, many people think this is asking about capitalizing all words in the string.

Note:
The question is ambiguous as to whether letters after the first should be forced to lower case.  The accepted answer assumes that only the first letter should be altered.

If a picture's worth 1000 words, how much of a picture can you fit in 140 characters?

Note: That's it folks! Bounty deadline is here, and after some tough deliberation, I have decided that Boojum's entry just barely edged out Sam Hocevar's. I will post more detailed notes once I've had a chance to write them up. Of course, everyone should feel free to continue to submit solutions and improve solutions for people to vote on. Thank you to everyone who submitted and entry; I enjoyed all of them. This has been a lot of fun for me to run, and I hope it's been fun for both the entrants and the spectators.

I came across this interesting post about trying to compress images into a Twitter comment, and lots of people in that thread (and a thread on Reddit) had suggestions about different ways you could do it. So, I figure it would make a good coding challenge; let people put their money where their mouth is, and show how their ideas about encoding can lead to more detail in the limited space that you have available.

I challenge you to come up with a general purpose system for encoding images into 140 character Twitter messages, and decoding them into an image again. You can use Unicode characters, so you get more than 8 bits per character. Even allowing for Unicode characters, however, you will need to compress images into a very small amount of space; this will certainly be a lossy compression, and so there will have to be subjective judgements about how good each result looks.

Here is the result that the original author, Quasimondo, got from his encoding (image is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial license):


Can you do better?

Rules


Your program must have two modes: encoding and decoding.
When encoding:


Your program must take as input a graphic in any reasonable raster graphic format of your choice. We'll say that any raster format supported by ImageMagick counts as reasonable.
Your program must output a message which can be represented in 140 or fewer Unicode code points; 140 code points in the range U+0000–U+10FFFF, excluding non-characters (U+FFFE, U+FFFF, U+nFFFE, U+nFFFF where n is 1–10 hexadecimal, and the range U+FDD0–U+FDEF) and surrogate code points (U+D800–U+DFFF). It may be output in any reasonable encoding of your choice; any encoding supported by GNU iconv will be considered reasonable, and your platform native encoding or locale encoding would likely be a good choice. See Unicode notes below for more details.

When decoding:


Your program should take as input the output of your encoding mode.
Your program must output an image in any reasonable format of your choice, as defined above, though for output vector formats are OK as well.
The image output should be an approximation of the input image; the closer you can get to the input image, the better.
The decoding process may have no access to any other output of the encoding process other than the output specified above; that is, you can't upload the image somewhere and output the URL for the decoding process to download, or anything silly like that.

For the sake of consistency in user interface, your program must behave as follows:


Your program must be a script that can be set to executable on a platform with the appropriate interpreter, or a program that can be compiled into an executable.
Your program must take as its first argument either encode or decode to set the mode.
Your program must take input in one or more of the following ways (if you implement the one that takes file names, you may also read and write from stdin and stdout if file names are missing):


Take input from standard in and produce output on standard out.

my-program encode <input.png >output.txt
my-program decode <output.txt >output.png

Take input from a file named in the second argument, and produce output in the file named in the third.

my-program encode input.png output.txt
my-program decode output.txt output.png



For your solution, please post:


Your code, in full, and/or a link to it hosted elsewhere (if it's very long, or requires many files to compile, or something).
An explanation of how it works, if it's not immediately obvious from the code or if the code is long and people will be interested in a summary.
An example image, with the original image, the text it compresses down to, and the decoded image.
If you are building on an idea that someone else had, please attribute them. It's OK to try to do a refinement of someone else's idea, but you must attribute them.



Guidelines

These are basically rules that may be broken, suggestions, or scoring criteria:


Aesthetics are important. I'll be judging, and suggest that other people judge, based on:


How good the output image looks, and how much it looks like the original.
How nice the text looks. Completely random gobbledigook is OK if you have a really clever compression scheme, but I also want to see answers that turn images into mutli-lingual poems, or something clever like that. Note that the author of the original solution decided to use only Chinese characters, since it looked nicer that way.
Interesting code and clever algorithms are always good. I like short, to the point, and clear code, but really clever complicated algorithms are OK too as long as they produce good results.

Speed is also important, though not as important as how good a job compressing the image you do. I'd rather have a program that can convert an image in a tenth of a second than something that will be running genetic algorithms for days on end.
I will prefer shorter solutions to longer ones, as long as they are reasonably comparable in quality; conciseness is a virtue.
Your program should be implemented in a language that has a freely-available implementation on Mac OS X, Linux, or Windows. I'd like to be able to run the programs, but if you have a great solution that only runs under MATLAB or something, that's fine.
Your program should be as general as possible; it should work for as many different images as possible, though some may produce better results than others. In particular:


Having a few images built into the program that it matches and writes a reference to, and then produces the matching image upon decoding, is fairly lame and will only cover a few images.
A program that can take images of simple, flat, geometric shapes and decompose them into some vector primitive is pretty nifty, but if it fails on images beyond a certain complexity it is probably insufficiently general.
A program that can only take images of a particular fixed aspect ratio but does a good job with them would also be OK, but not ideal.
You may find that a black and white image can get more information into a smaller space than a color image. On the other hand, that may limit the types of image it's applicable to; faces come out fine in black and white, but abstract designs may not fare so well.
It is perfectly fine if the output image is smaller than the input, while being roughly the same proportion. It's OK if you have to scale the image up to compare it to the original; what's important is how it looks.

Your program should produce output that could actually go through Twitter and come out unscathed. This is only a guideline rather than a rule, since I couldn't find any documentation on the precise set of characters supported, but you should probably avoid control characters, funky invisible combining characters, private use characters, and the like.


Scoring rubric

As a general guide to how I will be ranking solutions when choosing my accepted solution, lets say that I'll probably be evaluating solutions on a 25 point scale (this is very rough, and I won't be scoring anything directly, just using this as a basic guideline):


15 points for how well the encoding scheme reproduces a wide range of input images. This is a subjective, aesthetic judgement


0 means that it doesn't work at all, it gives the same image back every time, or something
5 means that it can encode a few images, though the decoded version looks ugly and it may not work at all on more complicated images
10 means that it works on a wide range of images, and produces pleasant looking images which may occasionally be distinguishable
15 means that it produces perfect replicas of some images, and even for larger and more complex images, gives something that is recognizable. Or, perhaps it does not make images that are quite recognizable, but produces beautiful images that are clearly derived from the original.

3 points for clever use of the Unicode character set


0 points for simply using the entire set of allowed characters
1 point for using a limited set of characters that are safe for transfer over Twitter or in a wider variety of situations
2 points for using a thematic subset of characters, such as only Han ideographs or only right-to-left characters
3 points for doing something really neat, like generating readable text or using characters that look like the image in question

3 points for clever algorithmic approaches and code style


0 points for something that is 1000 lines of code only to scale the image down, treat it as 1 bit per pixel, and base64 encode that
1 point for something that uses a standard encoding technique and is well written and brief
2 points for something that introduces a relatively novel encoding technique, or that is surprisingly short and clean
3 points for a one liner that actually produces good results, or something that breaks new ground in graphics encoding (if this seems like a low number of points for breaking new ground, remember that a result this good will likely have a high score for aesthetics as well)

2 points for speed. All else being equal, faster is better, but the above criteria are all more important than speed
1 point for running on free (open source) software, because I prefer free software (note that C# will still be eligible for this point as long as it runs on Mono, likewise MATLAB code would be eligible if it runs on GNU Octave)
1 point for actually following all of the rules. These rules have gotten a bit big and complicated, so I'll probably accept otherwise good answers that get one small detail wrong, but I will give an extra point to any solution that does actually follow all of the rules


Reference images

Some folks have asked for some reference images. Here are a few reference images that you can try; smaller versions are embedded here, they all link to larger versions of the image if you need those:






Prize

I am offering a 500 rep bounty (plus the 50 that StackOverflow kicks in) for the solution that I like the best, based on the above criteria. Of course, I encourage everyone else to vote on their favorite solutions here as well.

Note on deadline

This contest will run until the bounty runs out, about 6 PM on Saturday, May 30. I can't say the precise time it will end; it may be anywhere from 5 to 7 PM. I will guarantee that I'll look at all entries submitted by 2 PM, and I will do my best to look at all entries submitted by 4 PM; if solutions are submitted after that, I may not have a chance to give them a fair look before I have to make my decision. Also, the earlier you submit, the more chance you will have for voting to be able to help me pick the best solution, so try and submit earlier rather than right at the deadline.

Unicode notes

There has also been some confusion on exactly what Unicode characters are allowed. The range of possible Unicode code points is U+0000 to U+10FFFF. There are some code points which are never valid to use as Unicode characters in any open interchange of data; these are the noncharacters and the surrogate code points. Noncharacters are defined in the Unidode Standard 5.1.0 section 16.7 as the values U+FFFE, U+FFFF, U+nFFFE, U+nFFFF where n is 1–10 hexadecimal, and the range U+FDD0–U+FDEF. These values are intended to be used for application-specific internal usage, and conforming applications may strip these characters out of text processed by them. Surrogate code points, defined in the Unicode Standard 5.1.0 section 3.8 as U+D800–U+DFFF, are used for encoding characters beyond the Basic Multilingual Plane in UTF-16; thus, it is impossible to represent these code points directly in the UTF-16 encoding, and it is invalid to encode them in any other encoding. Thus, for the purpose of this contest, I will allow any program which encodes images into a sequence of no more than 140 Unicode code points from the range U+0000–U+10FFFF, excluding all noncharacters and surrogate pairs as defined above.

I will prefer solutions that use only assigned characters, and even better ones that use clever subsets of assigned characters or do something interesting with the character set they use. For a list of assigned characters, see the Unicode Character Database; note that some characters are listed directly, while some are listed only as the start and end of a range. Also note that surrogate code points are listed in the database, but forbidden as mentioned above. If you would like to take advantage of certain properties of characters for making the text you output more interesting, there are a variety of databases of character information available, such as a list of named code blocks and various character properties.

Since Twitter does not specify the exact character set they support, I will be lenient about solutions which do not actually work with Twitter because certain characters count extra or certain characters are stripped. It is preferred but not required that all encoded outputs should be able to be transferred unharmed via Twitter or another microblogging service such as identi.ca. I have seen some documentation stating that Twitter entity-encodes <, >, and &, and thus counts those as 4, 4, and 5 characters respectively, but I have not tested that out myself, and their JavaScript character counter doesn't seem to count them that way.

Tips & Links


The definition of valid Unicode characters in the rules is a bit complicated. Choosing a single block of characters, such as CJK Unified Ideographs (U+4E00–U+9FCF) may be easier.
You may use existing image libraries, like ImageMagick or Python Imaging Library, for your image manipulation.
If you need some help understanding the Unicode character set and its various encodings, see this quick guide or this detailed FAQ on UTF-8 in Linux and Unix.
The earlier you get your solution in, the more time I (and other people voting) will have to look at it. You can edit your solution if you improve it; I'll base my bounty on the most recent version when I take my last look through the solutions.
If you want an easy image format to parse and write (and don't want to just use an existing format), I'd suggest using the PPM format. It's a text based format that's very easy to work with, and you can use ImageMagick to convert to and from it.

It works fine when I select the Build Variant which has the applicationId set to com.my.app.package.name (the package name used when generating the google-services.json). But, my other flavors have different applicationIds.

I know it can be done using task as mentioned in this post. Is there a simpler way to just have one file or pick right file based on gradle configuration?

3295,1745691,"LINQ: When to use SingleOrDefault vs. FirstOrDefault() with filtering criteria

Consider the IEnumerable extension methods SingleOrDefault() and FirstOrDefault()

MSDN documents that SingleOrDefault:


  Returns the only element of a sequence, or a default value if the sequence is empty; this method throws an exception if there is more than one element in the sequence.


whereas FirstOrDefault from MSDN (presumably when using an OrderBy() or  OrderByDescending() or none at all),


  Returns the first element of a sequence


Consider a handful of example  queries, it's not always clear when to use these two methods:

var someCust = db.Customers
.SingleOrDefault(c=>c.ID == 5); //unlikely(?) to be more than one, but technically COULD BE

var bobbyCust = db.Customers
.FirstOrDefault(c=>c.FirstName == ""Bobby""); //clearly could be one or many, so use First?

var latestCust = db.Customers
.OrderByDescending(x=> x.CreatedOn)
.FirstOrDefault();//Single or First, or does it matter?

What conventions do you follow or suggest when deciding to use SingleOrDefault() and FirstOrDefault() in your LINQ queries?

3296,3900549,"What is ""runtime""?

I have heard about things like ""C Runtime"", ""Visual C++ 2008 Runtime"", "".NET Common Language Runtime"", etc.

What is ""runtime"" exactly?
What is it made of?
How does it interact with my code? Or maybe more precisely, how is my code controlled by it?

When coding assembly language on Linux, I could use the INT instruction to make the system call. So, is the runtime nothing but a bunch of pre-fabricated functions that wrap the low level function into more abstract and high level functions? But doesn't this seem more like the definition for the library, not for the runtime?
Are ""runtime"" and ""runtime library"" two different things?
ADD 1
These days, I am thinking maybe Runtime has something in common with the so called Virtual Machine, such as JVM. Here's the quotation that leads to such thought:

This compilation process is sufficiently complex to be broken into
several layers of abstraction, and these usually involve three
translators: a compiler, a virtual machine implementation, and an
assembler.  --- The Elements of Computing Systems (Introduction,
The Road Down To Hardware Land)

ADD 2
The book Expert C Programming: Deep C Secrets. Chapter 6 Runtime Data Structures is an useful reference to this question.
ADD 3 - 7:31 AM 2/28/2021
Here's some of my perspective after getting some knowledge about processor design. The whole computer thing is just multiple levels of abstraction. It goes from elementary transistors all the way up to the running program. For any level N of abstraction, its runtime is the immediate level N-1 of abstraction that goes below it. And it is God that give us the level 0 of abstraction.

3307,611906,"HTTP POST with URL query parameters -- good idea or not?

I'm designing an API to go over HTTP and I am wondering if using the HTTP POST command, but with URL query parameters only and no request body, is a good way to go.
Considerations:

""Good Web design"" requires non-idempotent actions to be sent via POST. This is a non-idempotent action.
It is easier to develop and debug this app when the request parameters are present in the URL.
The API is not intended for widespread use.
It seems like making a POST request with no body will take a bit more work, e.g. a Content-Length: 0 header must be explicitly added.
It also seems to me that a POST with no body is a bit counter to most developer's and HTTP frameworks' expectations.

Are there any more pitfalls or advantages to sending parameters on a POST request via the URL query rather than the request body?
Edit: The reason this is under consideration is that the operations are not idempotent and have side effects other than retrieval. See the HTTP spec:

In particular, the convention has been
established that the GET and HEAD
methods SHOULD NOT have the
significance of taking an action other
than retrieval. These methods ought to
be considered ""safe"". This allows user
agents to represent other methods,
such as POST, PUT and DELETE, in a
special way, so that the user is made
aware of the fact that a possibly
unsafe action is being requested.
...
Methods can also have the property of
""idempotence"" in that (aside from
error or expiration issues) the
side-effects of N > 0 identical
requests is the same as for a single
request. The methods GET, HEAD, PUT
and DELETE share this property. Also,
the methods OPTIONS and TRACE SHOULD
NOT have side effects, and so are
inherently idempotent.

What is the preferred method for returning null values in JSON? Is there a different preference for primitives?
For example, if my object on the server has an Integer called ""myCount"" with no value, the most correct JSON for that value would be:
{}

or
{
    ""myCount"": null
}

or
{
    ""myCount"": 0
}

Same question for Strings - if I have a null string ""myString"" on the server, is the best JSON:
{}

or
{
    ""myString"": null
}

or
{
    ""myString"": """"
}

or (lord help me)
{
    ""myString"": ""null""
}

I like the convention for collections to be represented in the JSON as an empty collection http://jtechies.blogspot.nl/2012/07/item-43-return-empty-arrays-or.html
An empty Array would be represented:
{
    ""myArray"": []
}

EDIT Summary
The 'personal preference' argument seems realistic, but short sighted in that, as a community we will be consuming an ever greater number of disparate services/sources. Conventions for JSON structure would help normalize consumption and reuse of said services. As far as establishing a standard, I would suggest adopting most of the Jackson conventions with a few exceptions:

Objects are preferred over primitives.
Empty collections are preferred over null.
Objects with no value are represented as null.
Primitives return their value.

If you are returning a JSON object with mostly null values, you may have a candidate for refactoring into multiple services.
{
    ""value1"": null,
    ""value2"": null,
    ""text1"": null,
    ""text2"": ""hello"",
    ""intValue"": 0, //use primitive only if you are absolutely sure the answer is 0
    ""myList"": [],
    ""myEmptyList"": null, //NOT BEST PRACTICE - return [] instead
    ""boolean1"": null, //use primitive only if you are absolutely sure the answer is true/false
    ""littleboolean"": false
}

The above JSON was generated from the following Java class.
package jackson;    
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;    
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;

I'm developing a page that pulls images from Flickr and Panoramio via jQuery's AJAX support.

The Flickr side is working fine, but when I try to $.get(url, callback) from Panoramio, I see an error in Chrome's console:

If I query that URL from a browser directly it works fine.  What is going on, and can I get around this?  Am I composing my query incorrectly, or is this something that Panoramio does to hinder what I'm trying to do?

But what about if you style the outer anchor as display:block in the stylesheet? Is it still wrong? The HTML 4.01 spec on block-level and inline elements seems to think so:

Style sheets provide the means to
specify the rendering of arbitrary
elements, including whether an element
is rendered as block or inline. In
some cases, such as an inline style
for list elements, this may be
appropriate, but generally speaking,
authors are discouraged from
overriding the conventional

3344,5797014,"Why do browsers match CSS selectors from right to left?

CSS Selectors are matched by browser engines from right to left. So they first find the children and then check their parents to see if they match the rest of the parts of the rule.


Why is this?
Is it just because the spec says?
Does it affect the eventual layout if it was evaluated from left to right?


To me the simplest way to do it would be use the selectors with the least number of elements. So IDs first (as they should only return 1 element). Then maybe classes or an element that has the fewest number of nodes — e.g. there may only be one span on the page so go directly to that node with any rule that references a span.

Here are some links backing up my claims


http://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/docs/rendering.html
https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Writing_Efficient_CSS




It sounds like that it is done this way to avoid having to look at all the children of parent (which could be many) rather than all the parents of a child which must be one. Even if the DOM is deep it would only look at one node per level rather than multiple in the RTL matching. Is it easier/faster to evaluate CSS selectors LTR or RTL?

I'm developing a part of an application that's responsible for exporting some data into CSV files. The application always uses UTF-8 because of its multilingual nature at all levels. But opening such CSV files (containing e.g. diacritics, cyrillic letters, Greek letters) in Excel does not achieve the expected results showing something like Г„/Г¤, Г–/Г¶. And I don't know how to force Excel understand that the open CSV file is encoded in UTF-8. I also tried specifying UTF-8 BOM EF BB BF, but Excel ignores that.

Is there any workaround?

P.S. Which tools may potentially behave like Excel does?



UPDATE

I have to say that I've confused the community with the formulation of the question. When I was asking this question, I asked for a way of opening a UTF-8 CSV file in Excel without any problems for a user, in a fluent and transparent way. However, I used a wrong formulation asking for doing it automatically. That is very confusing and it clashes with VBA macro automation. There are two answers for this questions that I appreciate the most: the very first answer by Alex https://stackoverflow.com/a/6002338/166589, and I've accepted this answer; and the second one by Mark https://stackoverflow.com/a/6488070/166589 that have appeared a little later. From the usability point of view, Excel seemed to have lack of a good user-friendly UTF-8 CSV support, so I consider both answers are correct, and I have accepted Alex's answer first because it really stated that Excel was not able to do that transparently. That is what I confused with automatically here. Mark's answer promotes a more complicated way for more advanced users to achieve the expected result. Both answers are great, but Alex's one fits my not clearly specified question a little better.



UPDATE 2

Five months later after the last edit, I've noticed that Alex's answer has disappeared for some reason. I really hope it wasn't a technical issue and I hope there is no more discussion on which answer is greater now. So I'm accepting Mark's answer as the best one.

I am trying to understand the difference between these four methods. I know by default that == calls the method equal? which returns true when both operands refer to exactly the same object.

=== by default also calls == which calls equal?... okay, so if all these three methods are not overridden, then I guess
===, == and equal? do exactly the same thing?

Now comes eql?. What does this do (by default)? Does it make a call to the operand's hash/id? 

Why does Ruby have so many equality signs? Are they supposed to differ in semantics?

3398,5739611,"What are the differences between Abstract Factory and Factory design patterns?

I know there are many posts out there about the differences between these two patterns, but there are a few things that I cannot find.

From what I have been reading, I see that the factory method pattern allows you to define how to create a single concrete product but hiding the implementation from the client as they will see a generic product. My first question is about the abstract factory. Is its role to allow you to create families of concrete objects in (that can depend on what specific factory you use) rather than just a single concrete object? Does the abstract factory only return one very large object or many objects depending on what methods you call?

My final two questions are about a single quote that I cannot fully understand that I have seen in numerous places:


  One difference between the two is that
  with the Abstract Factory pattern, a
  class delegates the responsibility of
  object instantiation to another object
  via composition whereas the Factory
  Method pattern uses inheritance and
  relies on a subclass to handle the
  desired object instantiation.


My understanding is that the factory method pattern has a Creator interface that will make the ConcreteCreator be in charge of knowing which ConcreteProduct to instantiate. Is this what it means by using inheritance to handle object instantiation?

Now with regards to that quote, how exactly does the Abstract Factory pattern delegate the responsibility of object instantiation to another object via composition? What does this mean? It looks like the Abstract Factory pattern also uses inheritance to do the construction process as well in my eyes, but then again I am still learning about these patterns.

Any help especially with the last question, would be greatly appreciated.

3399,6162484,"Why does modern Perl avoid UTF-8 by default?

I wonder why most modern solutions built using Perl don't enable UTF-8 by default.

I understand there are many legacy problems for core Perl scripts, where it may break things. But, from my point of view, in the 21st century, big new projects (or projects with a big perspective) should make their software UTF-8 proof from scratch. Still I don't see it happening. For example, Moose enables strict and warnings, but not Unicode. Modern::Perl reduces boilerplate too, but no UTF-8 handling.

Why? Are there some reasons to avoid UTF-8 in modern Perl projects in the year 2011?



Commenting @tchrist got too long, so I'm adding it here.

It seems that I did not make myself clear. Let me try to add some things.

tchrist and I see situation pretty similarly, but our conclusions are completely in opposite ends. I agree, the situation with Unicode is complicated, but this is why we (Perl users and coders) need some layer (or pragma) which makes UTF-8 handling as easy as it must be nowadays.

tchrist pointed to many aspects to cover, I will read and think about them for days or even weeks. Still, this is not my point. tchrist tries to prove that there is not one single way ""to enable UTF-8"". I have not so much knowledge to argue with that. So, I stick to live examples.

I played around with Rakudo and UTF-8 was just there as I needed. I didn't have any problems, it just worked. Maybe there are some limitation somewhere deeper, but at start, all I tested worked as I expected.

Shouldn't that be a goal in modern Perl 5 too? I stress it more: I'm not suggesting UTF-8 as the default character set for core Perl, I suggest the possibility to trigger it with a snap for those who develop new projects.

Another example, but with a more negative tone. Frameworks should make development easier. Some years ago, I tried web frameworks, but just threw them away because ""enabling UTF-8"" was so obscure. I did not find how and where to hook Unicode support. It was so time-consuming that I found it easier to go the old way. Now I saw here there was a bounty to deal with the same problem with Mason 2: How to make Mason2 UTF-8 clean?. So, it is pretty new framework, but using it with UTF-8 needs deep knowledge of its internals. It is like a big red sign: STOP, don't use me!

I really like Perl. But dealing with Unicode is painful. I still find myself running against walls. Some way tchrist is right and answers my questions: new projects don't attract UTF-8 because it is too complicated in Perl 5.

If you browse around stubhub you'll get redirected and 'blocked' within one or two requests. I've been investigating this and I can't figure out how they can tell that a user is using Selenium.
How do they do it?
I installed the Selenium IDE plugin in Firefox and I got banned when I went to stubhub.com in the normal Firefox browser with only the additional plugin.
When I use Fiddler to view the HTTP requests being sent back and forth I've noticed that the 'fake browser's' requests often have 'no-cache' in the response header.
Results like this Is there a way to detect that I'm in a Selenium Webdriver page from JavaScript? suggest that there should be no way to detect when you are using a webdriver. But this evidence suggests otherwise.
The site uploads a fingerprint to their servers, but I checked and the fingerprint of Selenium is identical to the fingerprint when using Chrome.
This is one of the fingerprint payloads that they send to their servers:

3413,573294,"When to use reinterpret_cast?

I am little confused with the applicability of reinterpret_cast vs static_cast. From what I have read the general rules are to use static cast when the types can be interpreted at compile time hence the word static. This is the cast the C++ compiler uses internally for implicit casts also.

reinterpret_casts are applicable in two scenarios:


convert integer types to pointer types and vice versa 
convert one pointer type to another. The general idea I get is this is unportable and should be avoided.  


Where I am a little confused is one usage which I need, I am calling C++ from C and the C code needs to hold on to the C++ object so basically it holds a void*. What cast should be used to convert between the void * and the Class type?

I have seen usage of both static_cast and reinterpret_cast? Though from what I have been reading it appears static is better as the cast can happen at compile time? Though it says to use reinterpret_cast to convert from one pointer type to another?

3414,1220751,"How to choose an AES encryption mode (CBC ECB CTR OCB CFB)?

Which of them are preferred in which circumstances? 

I'd like to see the list of evaluation crtieria for the various modes, and maybe a discussion of the applicability of each criterion. 

For example,
I think one of the criteria is ""size of the code"" for encryption and decryption, which is important for micro-code embedded systems, like 802.11 network adapters. IF the code required to implement CBC is much smaller than that required for CTR (I don't know this is true, it's just an example), then I could understand why the mode with the smaller code would be preferred.  But if I am writing an app that runs on a server, and the AES library I am using implements both CBC and CTR anyway, then this criterion is irrelevant. 

See what I mean by ""list of evaluation criteria and applicability of each criterion"" ??  

This isn't really programming related but it is algorithm related.

As I understand it, the following chain of events occurs in OAuth 2 in order for Site-A to access User's information from Site-B.


Site-A registers on Site-B, and obtains a Secret and an ID.
When User tells Site-A to access Site-B, User is sent to Site-B where they tell Site-B that they would indeed like to give Site-A permissions to specific information.
Site-B redirects User back to Site-A, along with an Authorization Code.
Site-A then passes that Authorization Code along with its Secret back to Site-B in return for a Security Token. 
Site-A then makes requests to Site-B on behalf of User by bundling the Security Token along with requests.

Hibernate doesn't like two collections with FetchType.EAGER, but this seems to be a bug, I'm not doing unusual things...

Removing FetchType.EAGER from Parent or AnotherParent solves the problem, but I need it, so real solution is to use @LazyCollection(LazyCollectionOption.FALSE) instead of FetchType (thanks to Bozho for the solution).

3491,12930272,"JavaScript closures vs. anonymous functions

A friend of mine and I are currently discussing what is a closure in JS and what isn't. We just want to make sure we really understand it correctly.

Let's take this example. We have a counting loop and want to print the counter variable on the console delayed. Therefore we use setTimeout and closures to capture the value of the counter variable to make sure that it will not print N times the value N.

The wrong solution without closures or anything near to closures would be:

for(var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    setTimeout(function() {
        console.log(i);
    }, 1000);
}


which will of course print 10 times the value of i after the loop, namely 10.

So his attempt was:

for(var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    (function(){
        var i2 = i;
        setTimeout(function(){
            console.log(i2);
        }, 1000)
    })();
}


printing 0 to 9 as expected.

I told him that he isn't using a closure to capture i, but he insists that he is. I proved that he doesn't use closures by putting the for loop body within another setTimeout (passing his anonymous function to setTimeout), printing 10 times 10 again. The same applies if I store his function in a var and execute it after the loop, also printing 10 times 10. So my argument is that he doesn't really capture the value of i, making his version not a closure.

My attempt was:

for(var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    setTimeout((function(i2){
        return function() {
            console.log(i2);
        }
    })(i), 1000);
}


So I capture i (named i2 within the closure), but now I return another function and pass this around. In my case, the function passed to setTimeout really captures i.

Now who is using closures and who isn't?

Note that both solutions print 0 to 9 on the console delayed, so they solve the original problem, but we want to understand which of those two solutions uses closures to accomplish this.

3492,13733552,"logger configuration to log to file and print to stdout

I'm using Python's logging module to log some debug strings to a file which works pretty well. Now in addition, I'd like to use this module to also print the strings out to stdout. How do I do this? In order to log my strings to a file I use following code:

import logging
import logging.handlers
logger = logging.getLogger("""")
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
handler = logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler(
    LOGFILE, maxBytes=(1048576*5), backupCount=7
)
formatter = logging.Formatter(""%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s"")
handler.setFormatter(formatter)
logger.addHandler(handler)


and then call a logger function like

logger.debug(""I am written to the file"")


Thank you for some help here!

3493,17365222,"UPDATE and REPLACE part of a string

I've got a table with two columns, ID and Value. I want to change a part of some strings in the second column.

Example of Table:

ID            Value
---------------------------------
1             c:\temp\123\abc\111
2             c:\temp\123\abc\222
3             c:\temp\123\abc\333
4             c:\temp\123\abc\444


Now the 123\ in the Value string is not needed. I tried UPDATE and REPLACE:

UPDATE dbo.xxx
SET Value = REPLACE(Value, '%123%', '')
WHERE ID <= 4


When I execute the script SQL Server does not report an error, but it does not update anything either. Why is that?

3494,42564058,"How to use local docker images with Minikube?

I have several docker images that I want to use with minikube. I don't want to first have to upload and then download the same image instead of just using the local image directly. How do I do this?
Stuff I tried:
1. I tried running these commands (separately, deleting the instances of minikube both times and starting fresh)
kubectl run hdfs --image=fluxcapacitor/hdfs:latest --port=8989
kubectl run hdfs --image=fluxcapacitor/hdfs:latest --port=8989 imagePullPolicy=Never

hdfs-2425930030-q0sdl   0/1       ContainerCreating   0          10m

It just gets stuck on some status but never reaches the ready state.
2. I tried creating a registry and then putting images into it but that didn't work either. I might've done that incorrectly but I can't find proper instructions to do this task.

3495,47152691,"How can I pivot a dataframe?


What is pivot?
How do I pivot?
Long format to wide format?

I've seen a lot of questions that ask about pivot tables, even if they don't know it.  It is virtually impossible to write a canonical question and answer that encompasses all aspects of pivoting... But I'm going to give it a go.

The problem with existing questions and answers is that often the question is focused on a nuance that the OP has trouble generalizing in order to use a number of the existing good answers.  However, none of the answers attempt to give a comprehensive explanation (because it's a daunting task). Look at a few examples from my Google search:

How to pivot a dataframe in Pandas? - Good question and answer.  But the answer only answers the specific question with little explanation.
pandas pivot table to data frame - OP is concerned with the output of the pivot, namely how the columns look.  OP wanted it to look like R.  This isn't very helpful for pandas users.
pandas pivoting a dataframe, duplicate rows - Another decent question but the answer focuses on one method, namely pd.DataFrame.pivot


Setup
I conspicuously named my columns and relevant column values to correspond with how I'm going to pivot in the answers below.
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from numpy.core.defchararray import add

np.random.seed([3,1415])
n = 20

cols = np.array(['key', 'row', 'item', 'col'])
arr1 = (np.random.randint(5, size=(n, 4)) // [2, 1, 2, 1]).astype(str)

df = pd.DataFrame(
    add(cols, arr1), columns=cols
).join(
    pd.DataFrame(np.random.rand(n, 2).round(2)).add_prefix('val')
)
print(df)


     key   row   item   col  val0  val1
0   key0  row3  item1  col3  0.81  0.04
1   key1  row2  item1  col2  0.44  0.07
2   key1  row0  item1  col0  0.77  0.01
3   key0  row4  item0  col2  0.15  0.59
4   key1  row0  item2  col1  0.81  0.64
5   key1  row2  item2  col4  0.13  0.88
6   key2  row4  item1  col3  0.88  0.39
7   key1  row4  item1  col1  0.10  0.07
8   key1  row0  item2  col4  0.65  0.02
9   key1  row2  item0  col2  0.35  0.61
10  key2  row0  item2  col1  0.40  0.85

Questions

Why do I get ValueError: Index contains duplicate entries, cannot reshape?

How do I pivot df such that the col values are columns, row values are the index, and mean of val0 are the values?
col   col0   col1   col2   col3  col4
row
row0  0.77  0.605    NaN  0.860  0.65
row2  0.13    NaN  0.395  0.500  0.25
row3   NaN  0.310    NaN  0.545   NaN
row4   NaN  0.100  0.395  0.760  0.24


How do I make it so that missing values are 0?
col   col0   col1   col2   col3  col4
row
row0  0.77  0.605  0.000  0.860  0.65

row4  0.00  0.100  0.395  0.760  0.24


Can I get something other than mean, like maybe sum?
col   col0  col1  col2  col3  col4
row
row0  0.77  1.21  0.00  0.86  0.65

row4  0.00  0.10  0.79  1.52  0.24


Can I do more that one aggregation at a time?
       sum                          mean

3504,43618487,"Why are emoji characters like 👩‍👩‍👧‍👦 treated so strangely in Swift strings?

The character 👩‍👩‍👧‍👦 (family with two women, one girl, and one boy) is encoded as such:

U+1F469 WOMAN,
‍U+200D ZWJ,
U+1F469 WOMAN,
U+200D ZWJ,
U+1F467 GIRL,
U+200D ZWJ,
U+1F466 BOY

So it's very interestingly-encoded; the perfect target for a unit test. However, Swift doesn't seem to know how to treat it. Here's what I mean:

""👩‍👩‍👧‍👦"".contains(""👩‍👩‍👧‍👦"") // true
""👩‍👩‍👧‍👦"".contains(""👩"") // false
""👩‍👩‍👧‍👦"".contains(""\u{200D}"") // false
""👩‍👩‍👧‍👦"".contains(""👧"") // false
""👩‍👩‍👧‍👦"".contains(""👦"") // true


So, Swift says it contains itself (good) and a boy (good!). But it then says it does not contain a woman, girl, or zero-width joiner. What's happening here? Why does Swift know it contains a boy but not a woman or girl? I could understand if it treated it as a single character and only recognized it containing itself, but the fact that it got one subcomponent and no others baffles me.

This does not change if I use something like ""👩"".characters.first!.



Even more confounding is this:

let manual = ""\u{1F469}\u{200D}\u{1F469}\u{200D}\u{1F467}\u{200D}\u{1F466}""
Array(manual.characters) // [""👩‍"", ""👩‍"", ""👧‍"", ""👦""]


Even though I placed the ZWJs in there, they aren't reflected in the character array. What followed was a little telling:

manual.contains(""👩"") // false
manual.contains(""👧"") // false
manual.contains(""👦"") // true


So I get the same behavior with the character array... which is supremely annoying, since I know what the array looks like.

This also does not change if I use something like ""👩"".characters.first!.

What minimalistic approach would you use to output that to HTML (or text, for that matter) as a correctly ordered, correctly indented tree? 

Assume further you only have basic data structures (arrays and hashmaps), no fancy objects with parent/children references, no ORM, no framework, just your two hands. The table is represented as a result set, which can be accessed randomly. 

Pseudo code or plain English is okay, this is purely a conceptional question.

Bonus question: Is there a fundamentally better way to store a tree structure like this in a RDBMS?



EDITS AND ADDITIONS

To answer one commenter's (Mark Bessey's) question: A root node is not necessary, because it is never going to be displayed anyway. ParentId = 0 is the convention to express ""these are top level"". The Order column defines how nodes with the same parent are going to be sorted.

The ""result set"" I spoke of can be pictured as an array of hashmaps (to stay in that terminology). For my example was meant to be already there. Some answers go the extra mile and construct it first, but thats okay.

The tree can be arbitrarily deep. Each node can have N children. I did not exactly have a ""millions of entries"" tree in mind, though.

Don't mistake my choice of node naming ('Node 1.1.1') for something to rely on. The nodes could equally well be called 'Frank' or 'Bob', no naming structure is implied, this was merely to make it readable.

I have posted my own solution so you guys can pull it to pieces.

#
# This is the main Apache HTTP server configuration file.  It contains the
# configuration directives that give the server its instructions.
# See <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2> for detailed information.
# In particular, see
# <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/directives.html>
# for a discussion of each configuration directive.
#
# Do NOT simply read the instructions in here without understanding
# what they do.  They're here only as hints or reminders.  If you are unsure
# consult the online docs. You have been warned.
#
# Configuration and logfile names: If the filenames you specify for many
# of the server's control files begin with ""/"" (or ""drive:/"" for Win32), the
# server will use that explicit path.  If the filenames do *not* begin
# with ""/"", the value of ServerRoot is prepended -- so ""logs/foo.log""
# with ServerRoot set to ""C:/Program Files (x86)/Apache Software Foundation/Apache2.2"" will be interpreted by the
# server as ""C:/Program Files (x86)/Apache Software Foundation/Apache2.2/logs/foo.log"".
#
# NOTE: Where filenames are specified, you must use forward slashes
# instead of backslashes (e.g., ""c:/apache"" instead of ""c:\apache"").
# If a drive letter is omitted, the drive on which httpd.exe is located
# will be used by default.  It is recommended that you always supply
# an explicit drive letter in absolute paths to avoid confusion.

#
# ServerRoot: The top of the directory tree under which the server's
# configuration, error, and log files are kept.
#
# Do not add a slash at the end of the directory path.  If you point
# ServerRoot at a non-local disk, be sure to point the LockFile directive
# at a local disk.  If you wish to share the same ServerRoot for multiple
# httpd daemons, you will need to change at least LockFile and PidFile.
#
ServerRoot ""C:/Program Files (x86)/Apache Software Foundation/Apache2.2""

#
# Listen: Allows you to bind Apache to specific IP addresses and/or
# ports, instead of the default. See also the <VirtualHost>

3563,430142,"What algorithms compute directions from point A to point B on a map?

How do map providers (such as Google or Yahoo! Maps) suggest directions?

I mean, they probably have real-world data in some form, certainly including distances but also perhaps things like driving speeds, presence of sidewalks, train schedules, etc.  But suppose the data were in a simpler format, say a very large directed graph with edge weights reflecting distances.  I want to be able to quickly compute directions from one arbitrary point to another.  Sometimes these points will be close together (within one city) while sometimes they will be far apart (cross-country).

Graph algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm will not work because the graph is enormous.  Luckily, heuristic algorithms like A* will probably work.  However, our data is very structured, and perhaps some kind of tiered approach might work?  (For example, store precomputed directions between certain ""key"" points far apart, as well as some local directions.  Then directions for two far-away points will involve local directions to a key points, global directions to another key point, and then local directions again.)

What algorithms are actually used in practice?

PS.  This question was motivated by finding quirks in online mapping directions.  Contrary to the triangle inequality, sometimes Google Maps thinks that X-Z takes longer and is farther than using an intermediate point as in X-Y-Z.  But maybe their walking directions optimize for another parameter, too?

PPS.  Here's another violation of the triangle inequality that suggests (to me) that they use some kind of tiered approach: X-Z versus X-Y-Z.  The former seems to use prominent Boulevard de Sebastopol even though it's slightly out of the way.

Edit: Neither of these examples seem to work anymore, but both did at the time of the original post.

3564,1106377,"Detect when a browser receives a file download

I have a page that allows the user to download a dynamically-generated file. It takes a long time to generate, so I'd like to show a ""waiting"" indicator. The problem is, I can't figure out how to detect when the browser has received the file so that I can hide the indicator.
I'm requesting a hidden form, which POSTs to the server, and targets a hidden iframe for its results. This is, so I don't replace the entire browser window with the result. I listen for a ""load"" event on the iframe, hoping that it will fire when the download is complete.
I return a ""Content-Disposition: attachment"" header with the file, which causes the browser to show the ""Save"" dialog. But the browser doesn't fire a ""load"" event in the iframe.
One approach I tried is using a multi-part response. So it would send an empty HTML file, as well as the attached downloadable file.
For example:
Content-type: multipart/x-mixed-replace;boundary=""abcde""

--abcde
Content-type: text/html

--abcde
Content-type: application/vnd.fdf
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=foo.fdf

file-content
--abcde

This works in Firefox; it receives the empty HTML file, fires the ""load"" event, and then shows the ""Save"" dialog for the downloadable file. But it fails on Internet Explorer and Safari; Internet Explorer fires the ""load"" event, but it doesn't download the file, and Safari downloads the file (with the wrong name and content-type) and doesn't fire the ""load"" event.
A different approach might be to call to start the file creation, poll the server until it's ready, and then download the already-created file. But I'd rather avoid creating temporary files on the server.
What should I do?

What is a good way to design/structure large functional programs, especially in Haskell?

I've been through a bunch of the tutorials (Write Yourself a Scheme being my favorite, with Real World Haskell a close second) - but most of the programs are relatively small, and single-purpose.  Additionally, I don't consider some of them to be particularly elegant (for example, the vast lookup tables in WYAS).

I'm now wanting to write larger programs, with more moving parts - acquiring data from a variety of different sources, cleaning it, processing it in various ways, displaying it in user interfaces, persisting it, communicating over networks, etc.  How could one best structure such code to be legible, maintainable, and adaptable to changing requirements?

There is quite a large literature addressing these questions for large object-oriented imperative programs. Ideas like MVC, design patterns, etc. are decent prescriptions for realizing broad goals like separation of concerns and reusability in an OO style.  Additionally, newer imperative languages lend themselves to a 'design as you grow' style of refactoring to which, in my novice opinion, Haskell appears less well-suited.

Is there an equivalent literature for Haskell?  How is the zoo of exotic control structures available in functional programming (monads, arrows, applicative, etc.) best employed for this purpose? What best practices could you recommend?

Thanks!

EDIT (this is a follow-up to Don Stewart's answer):

@dons mentioned: ""Monads capture key architectural designs in types.""

I guess my question is: how should one think about key architectural designs in a pure functional language?

Consider the example of several data streams, and several processing steps.  I can write modular parsers for the data streams to a set of data structures, and I can implement each processing step as a pure function.  The processing steps required for one piece of data will depend on its value and others'.  Some of the steps should be followed by side-effects like GUI updates or database queries.

What's the 'Right' way to tie the data and the parsing steps in a nice way?  One could write a big function which does the right thing for the various data types.  Or one could use a monad to keep track of what's been processed so far and have each processing step get whatever it needs next from the monad state.  Or one could write largely separate programs and send messages around (I don't much like this option).

The slides he linked have a Things we Need bullet: ""Idioms for mapping design onto 
types/functions/classes/monads"".  What are the idioms? :)

3614,3521290,"Logout: GET or POST?

This question is not about when to use GET or POST in general; it is about which is the recommended one for handling logging out of a web application. I have found plenty of information on the differences between GET and POST in the general sense, but I did not find a definite answer for this particular scenario.

As a pragmatist, I'm inclined to use GET, because implementing it is way simpler than POST; just drop a simple link and you're done. This seems to be case with the vast majority of websites I can think of, at least from the top of my head. Even Stack Overflow handles logging out with GET.

The thing making me hesitate is the (albeit old) argument that some web accelerators/proxies pre-cache pages by going and retrieving every link they find in the page, so the user gets a faster response when she clicks on them. I'm not sure if this still applies, but if this was the case, then in theory a user with one of these accelerators would get kicked out of the application as soon as she logs in, because her accelerator would find and retrieve the logout link even if she never clicked on it.

Everything I have read so far suggest that POST should be used for ""destructive actions"", whereas actions that do not alter the internal state of the application -like querying and such- should be handled with GET. Based on this, the real question here is:

Is logging out of an application considered a destructive action/does it alter the internal state of the application?

3617,6974684,"How to send FormData objects with Ajax-requests in jQuery?

The XMLHttpRequest Level 2 standard (still a working draft) defines the FormData interface. This interface enables appending File objects to XHR-requests (Ajax-requests).

Btw, this is a new feature - in the past, the ""hidden-iframe-trick"" was used (read about that in my other question).

This is how it works (example):

var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(),
    fd = new FormData();

fd.append( 'file', input.files[0] );
xhr.open( 'POST', 'http://example.com/script.php', true );
xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;
xhr.send( fd );


where input is a <input type=""file""> field, and handler is the success-handler for the Ajax-request.

This works beautifully in all browsers (again, except IE).

Now, I would like to make this functionality work with jQuery. I tried this:

var fd = new FormData();    
fd.append( 'file', input.files[0] );

$.post( 'http://example.com/script.php', fd, handler );


Unfortunately, that won't work (an ""Illegal invocation"" error is thrown - screenshot is here). I assume jQuery expects a simple key-value object representing form-field-names / values, and the FormData instance that I'm passing in is apparently incompatible.

Now, since it is possible to pass a FormData instance into xhr.send(), I hope that it is also possible to make it work with jQuery.



Update:

I've created a ""feature ticket"" over at jQuery's Bug Tracker. It's here: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9995

I was suggested to use an ""Ajax prefilter""...



Update:

First, let me give a demo demonstrating what behavior I would like to achieve. 

HTML:

<form>
    <input type=""file"" id=""file"" name=""file"">
    <input type=""submit"">
</form>


JavaScript:

$( 'form' ).submit(function ( e ) {
    var data, xhr;

    data = new FormData();
    data.append( 'file', $( '#file' )[0].files[0] );

    xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();

    xhr.open( 'POST', 'http://hacheck.tel.fer.hr/xml.pl', true );
    xhr.onreadystatechange = function ( response ) {};
    xhr.send( data );

    e.preventDefault();
});


The above code results in this HTTP-request:



This is what I need - I want that ""multipart/form-data"" content-type!



The proposed solution would be like so:

$( 'form' ).submit(function ( e ) {
    var data;

    data = new FormData();
    data.append( 'file', $( '#file' )[0].files[0] );

    $.ajax({
        url: 'http://hacheck.tel.fer.hr/xml.pl',
        data: data,
        processData: false,
        type: 'POST',
        success: function ( data ) {
            alert( data );
        }
    });

    e.preventDefault();
});


However, this results in:



As you can see, the content type is wrong...

3620,18541940,"Map vs Object in JavaScript

I just discovered this feature:

Map: Map objects are simple key/value maps.

That confused me. Regular JavaScript objects are dictionaries, so how is a Map different from a dictionary? Conceptually, they're identical (according to another question on Stack Overflow)
The documentation doesn't help either:

Map objects are collections of key/value pairs where both the keys and values may be arbitrary ECMAScript language values. A distinct key value may only occur in one key/value pair within the Map’s collection. Distinct key values as discriminated using the a comparision algorithm that is selected when the Map is created.


A Map object can iterate its elements in insertion order. Map object must be implemented using either hash tables or other mechanisms that, on average, provide access times that are sublinear on the number of elements in the collection. The data structures used in this Map objects specification is only intended to describe the required observable semantics of Map objects. It is not intended to be a viable implementation model.

…still sounds like an object to me, so clearly I've missed something.
Why is JavaScript gaining a (well-supported) Map object? What does it do?

master is my this is the latest stable release code, develop is my this is the 'next' release code, and feature is a new feature being prepared for develop.
Using hooks, I want to be able to refuse pushes to feature to my remote repository, unless commit f is a direct descendant of develop HEAD. I.e., the commit tree looks like this, because feature has been git rebase on d.

3627,12567984,"Visual Studio debugging/loading very slow

I'm at wit's end. Visual Studio is typically painfully slow to debug or just plain load (""start without debugging"") my ASP.NET MVC sites. Not always: at first, the projects will load nice and fast, but once they load slow, they'll always load slowly after that. I could be waiting 1-2 minutes or more.
My setup:
I'm using Visual Studio 2012 Express, currently, but I've had the same problem in Visual Studio 2010 Express as well. My solution is stored on a network drive; specifically, it's My Documents redirected to a network drive, if it matters. (It shouldn't. There are times where my site loads very fast under this setup.)
I load in Internet  Explorer 9 usually, but the same problem happens in Firefox.
This can happen in any ASP.NET MVC project I work on, and it seems to revolve around having DisplayTemplates, which all my ASP.NET MVC projects do. And it's all C# and Razor if that mattered.
Symptoms:
The system will load my symbols hundreds of times. Basically, the following, but there are at least 300 such rows, each with ever-so-slightly different DLL files for the same CSHTMLs:
'iisexpress.exe' (Managed (v4.0.30319)): Loaded 'C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\Temporary ASP.NET Files\root\b63f8236\6775085d\App_Web_contact.cshtml.22013bb9.xighmhow.dll', Symbols loaded.

In the above, I've got three DisplayTemplates: ""Contact"", ""Location"", and ""StatusCode"". It appears that IIS is loading symbols twice for each time the display template gets called. Thus, if I'm displaying a table of 100 entries that call all three of these display templates, it's 600 separate symbols loaded.
This isn't a fast operation either. The log files that IIS generates take about 200  ms for each symbol to load. Thus, super-long delays.
What I've Tried:

Debug or Release version, it doesn't matter.
Putting my project on a full IIS implementation on a web server runs it super fast with no problems.
Cassini, IIS  Express 7.5, and IIS  Express 8.0 all have the problem.
Delete All Breakpoints does nothing.
Clean Solution, or deleting the .suo also do nothing.
If I repair IIS  Express/ delete the My Docs\IISExpress folder, or repair/reinstall Visual Studio → the issue MAY go away, but only for a while before it comes right back.

Any advice at all is appreciated.
To answer more questions, yes my machine definitely has horsepower. The infuriating thing is that the same project, with NOTHING altered, can sometimes load very quickly, typically after I repair IIS  Express and delete the My Docs\IISExpress folder. Eventually, ""something"" happens and it's down to 2 minutes to load again. What I'm working on is not a complicated project. No external libraries or dependencies and my VS.NET has no add-ons whatsoever.
Of note, this machine has Symantec Endpoint Protection, which has a history of causing havoc. But disabling it outright (it's good to be an administrator) did not fix the problem.
I have a theory at this point. I'm thinking this is all because I'm working off a redirected folder off a network share. While the debugger was going through its hundreds of ""loaded symbols"" lines, I paused to see what it was doing. It was in my code, loading the DisplayTemplate I had.

It looks like Visual Studio is recompiling my display template every time it's called, which is again, hundreds of times. My theory is that Visual Studio compiles the file, saves it to the network share, then somehow stamps a new time on it, and Visual Studio then thinks the file has changed. Thus, Visual Studio recompiles it yet again. Only a theory though; I really have no clue.
For one, apparently, I have offline files (this is a desktop computer in an office; I couldn't care less). I'm going to disable, reboot, and retry tomorrow.
Plus, moving my project, as is, to the local C: fixes it. It loads very quickly. But this is not ideal in a work environment. I lose Previous Versions, my code isn't backed up at all unless I manually copy it, and it's no longer shared with anyone.
I can make do with copying it back and forth from C to the network share if it comes to it. It's much more annoying to wait two minutes for every page to load.

I wrote a Python program that acts on a large input file to create a few million objects representing triangles.  The algorithm is:


read an input file
process the file and create a list of triangles, represented by their vertices
output the vertices in the OFF format: a list of vertices followed by a list of triangles.  The triangles are represented by indices into the list of vertices


The requirement of OFF that I print out the complete list of vertices before I print out the triangles means that I have to hold the list of triangles in memory before I write the output to file.  In the meanwhile I'm getting memory errors because of the sizes of the lists.

3638,54120862,"Does the C++ standard allow for an uninitialized bool to crash a program?

I know that an ""undefined behaviour"" in C++ can pretty much allow the compiler to do anything it wants. However, I had a crash that surprised me, as I assumed that the code was safe enough.

In this case, the real problem happened only on a specific platform using a specific compiler, and only if optimization was enabled.

I tried several things in order to reproduce the problem and simplify it to the maximum. Here's an extract of a function called Serialize, that would take a bool parameter, and copy the string true or false to an existing destination buffer.

Would this function be in a code review, there would be no way to tell that it, in fact, could crash if the bool parameter was an uninitialized value?

// Zero-filled global buffer of 16 characters
char destBuffer[16];

void Serialize(bool boolValue) {
    // Determine which string to print based on boolValue
    const char* whichString = boolValue ? ""true"" : ""false"";

    // Compute the length of the string we selected
    const size_t len = strlen(whichString);

    // Copy string into destination buffer, which is zero-filled (thus already null-terminated)
    memcpy(destBuffer, whichString, len);
}


If this code is executed with clang 5.0.0 + optimizations, it will/can crash.

The expected ternary-operator boolValue ? ""true"" : ""false"" looked safe enough for me, I was assuming, ""Whatever garbage value is in boolValue doesn't matter, since it will evaluate to true or false anyhow.""

I have setup a Compiler Explorer example that shows the problem in the disassembly, here the complete example. Note: in order to repro the issue, the combination I've found that worked is by using Clang 5.0.0 with -O2 optimisation.

#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>

// Simple struct, with an empty constructor that doesn't initialize anything
struct FStruct {
    bool uninitializedBool;

   __attribute__ ((noinline))  // Note: the constructor must be declared noinline to trigger the problem
   FStruct() {};
};

char destBuffer[16];

// Small utility function that allocates and returns a string ""true"" or ""false"" depending on the value of the parameter
void Serialize(bool boolValue) {
    // Determine which string to print depending if 'boolValue' is evaluated as true or false
    const char* whichString = boolValue ? ""true"" : ""false"";

    // Compute the length of the string we selected
    size_t len = strlen(whichString);

    memcpy(destBuffer, whichString, len);
}

int main()
{
    // Locally construct an instance of our struct here on the stack. The bool member uninitializedBool is uninitialized.
    FStruct structInstance;

    // Output ""true"" or ""false"" to stdout
    Serialize(structInstance.uninitializedBool);
    return 0;
}


The problem arises because of the optimizer: It was clever enough to deduce that the strings ""true"" and ""false"" only differs in length by 1. So instead of really calculating the length, it uses the value of the bool itself, which should technically be either 0 or 1, and goes like this:

const size_t len = strlen(whichString); // original code
const size_t len = 5 - boolValue;       // clang clever optimization


While this is ""clever"", so to speak, my question is: Does the C++ standard allow a compiler to assume a bool can only have an internal numerical representation of '0' or '1' and use it in such a way?

Or is this a case of implementation-defined, in which case the implementation assumed that all its bools will only ever contain 0 or 1, and any other value is undefined behaviour territory?

I have very large tables (30 million rows) that I would like to load as a dataframes in R.  read.table() has a lot of convenient features, but it seems like there is a lot of logic in the implementation that would slow things down.

I know that reading in a table as a list using scan() can be quite fast, e.g.:

datalist <- scan('myfile',sep='\t',list(url='',popularity=0,mintime=0,maxtime=0)))

3663,1984186,"What is private bytes, virtual bytes, working set?

I am trying to use the perfmon windows utility to debug memory leaks in a process.

This is how perfmon explains the terms:

Working Set is the current size, in bytes, of the Working Set of this process. The Working Set is the set of memory pages touched recently by the threads in the process. If free memory in the computer is above a threshold, pages are left in the Working Set of a process even if they are not in use.  When free memory falls below a threshold, pages are trimmed from Working Sets. If they are needed they will then be soft-faulted back into the Working Set before leaving main memory.

Virtual Bytes is the current size, in bytes, of the virtual address space the process is using. Use of virtual address space does not necessarily imply corresponding use of either disk or main memory pages. Virtual space is finite, and the process can limit its ability to load libraries.

Private Bytes is the current size, in bytes, of memory that this process has allocated that cannot be shared with other processes.

These are the questions I have:

Is it the Private Bytes which I should measure to be sure if the process is having any leaks as it does not involve any shared libraries and any leaks, if happening, will come from the process itself?

What is the total memory consumed by the process? Is it the Virtual Bytes or is it the sum of Virtual Bytes and Working Set?

Is there any relation between Private Bytes, Working Set and Virtual Bytes?

3673,299304,"Why does Java's hashCode() in String use 31 as a multiplier?

  using int arithmetic, where s[i] is the
   ith character of the string, n is the length of

Why is 31 used as a multiplier?

I understand that the multiplier should be a relatively large prime number. So why not 29, or 37, or even 97?

3679,512877,"Why can't I define a static method in a Java interface?

EDIT: As of Java 8, static methods are now allowed in interfaces.

Here's the example:

public interface IXMLizable<T>
{
  static T newInstanceFromXML(Element e);
  Element toXMLElement();
}


Of course this won't work.  But why not?

One of the possible issues would be, what happens when you call:

IXMLizable.newInstanceFromXML(e);


In this case, I think it should just call an empty method (i.e. {}).  All subclasses would be forced to implement the static method, so they'd all be fine when calling the static method.  So why isn't this possible?

EDIT: I guess I'm looking for answer that's deeper than ""because that's the way Java is"". 

Is there a particular technological reason why static methods can't be overwritten? That is, why did the designers of Java decide to make instance methods overrideable but not static methods?

EDIT: The problem with my design is I'm trying to use interfaces to enforce a coding convention.

That is, the goal of the interface is twofold:


I want the IXMLizable interface to allow me to convert classes that implement it to XML elements (using polymorphism, works fine).
If someone wants to make a new instance of a class that implements the IXMLizable interface, they will always know that there will be a newInstanceFromXML(Element e) static constructor.


Is there any other way to ensure this, other than just putting a comment in the interface?

So I am hoping for an answer with docker-compose on board commands, which will hopefully the case if they finish this issue.

There is a proposal for providing a built-in way to determine if a container is ""alive"". So docker-compose can maybe make use of it in near future.

3721,6068113,"Do sessions really violate RESTfulness?

Is using sessions in a RESTful API really violating RESTfulness? I have seen many opinions going either direction, but I'm not convinced that sessions are RESTless. From my point of view:


authentication is not prohibited for RESTfulness (otherwise there'd be little use in RESTful services)
authentication is done by sending an authentication token in the request, usually the header
this authentication token needs to be obtained somehow and may be revoked, in which case it needs to be renewed
the authentication token needs to be validated by the server (otherwise it wouldn't be authentication)


So how do sessions violate this?


client-side, sessions are realized using cookies
cookies are simply an extra HTTP header
a session cookie can be obtained and revoked at any time
session cookies can have an infinite life time if need be
the session id (authentication token) is validated server-side


As such, to the client, a session cookie is exactly the same as any other HTTP header based authentication mechanism, except that it uses the Cookie header instead of the Authorization or some other proprietary header. If there was no session attached to the cookie value server-side, why would that make a difference? The server side implementation does not need to concern the client as long as the server behaves RESTful. As such, cookies by themselves should not make an API RESTless, and sessions are simply cookies to the client.

Are my assumptions wrong? What makes session cookies RESTless?

3760,299068,"What are the effects of exceptions on performance in Java?

Question:  Is exception handling in Java actually slow?

Conventional wisdom, as well as a lot of Google results, says that exceptional logic shouldn't be used for normal program flow in Java.  Two reasons are usually given,


it is really slow - even an order of magnitude slower than regular code (the reasons given vary),  


and 


it is messy because people expect only errors to be handled in exceptional code.  


This question is about #1.

As an example, this page describes Java exception handling as ""very slow"" and relates the slowness to the creation of the exception message string - ""this string is then used in creating the exception object that is thrown. This is not fast.""  The article Effective Exception Handling in Java says that ""the reason for this is due to the object creation aspect of exception handling, which thereby makes throwing exceptions inherently slow"".  Another reason out there is that the stack trace generation is what slows it down.

My testing (using Java 1.6.0_07, Java HotSpot 10.0, on 32 bit Linux), indicates that exception handling is no slower than regular code.  I tried running a method in a loop that executes some code.  At the end of the method, I use a boolean to indicate whether to return or throw.  This way the actual processing is the same. I tried running the methods in different orders and averaging my test times, thinking it may have been the JVM warming up.  In all my tests, the throw was at least as fast as the return, if not faster (up to 3.1% faster).  I am completely open to the possibility that my tests were wrong, but I haven't seen anything out there in the way of the code sample, test comparisons, or results in the last year or two that show exception handling in Java to actually be slow.

What leads me down this path was an API I needed to use that threw exceptions as part of normal control logic.  I wanted to correct them in their usage, but now I may not be able to.  Will I instead have to praise them on their forward thinking?

In the paper Efficient Java exception handling in just-in-time compilation, the authors suggest that the presence of exception handlers alone, even if no exceptions are thrown, is enough to prevent the JIT compiler from optimizing the code properly, thus slowing it down.  I haven't tested this theory yet.

I do not like that kind of programming, as it is using exceptions to perform flow control. However, if it is included in the language, there must be a good reason for it, isn't it?

It is my understanding that exceptions are not errors, and that they should only be used for exceptional conditions (e.g. I try to write a file into disk and there is no more space, or maybe I do not have permission), and not for flow control. 

Normally I handle exceptions as:

something = some_default_value
try:
    something = try_this(whatever)
except SomeException as exception:
    #Handle exception
finally:
    return something


Or if I really do not want to return anything if an exception happens, then:

I am writing a client-side Swing application (graphical font designer) on Java 5. Recently, I am running into java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space error because I am not being conservative on memory usage. The user can open unlimited number of files, and the program keeps the opened objects in the memory. After a quick research I found Ergonomics in the 5.0 Java Virtual Machine and others saying on Windows machine the JVM defaults max heap size as 64MB.

Given this situation, how should I deal with this constraint?

I could increase the max heap size using command line option to java, but that would require figuring out available RAM and writing some launching program or script. Besides, increasing to some finite max does not ultimately get rid of the issue.

I could rewrite some of my code to persist objects to file system frequently (using database is the same thing) to free up the memory. It could work, but it's probably a lot work too.

If you could point me to details of above ideas or some alternatives like automatic virtual memory, extending heap size dynamically, that will be great.

3868,161053,"Which is faster: Stack allocation or Heap allocation

This question may sound fairly elementary, but this is a debate I had with another developer I work with.

I was taking care to stack allocate things where I could, instead of heap allocating them. He was talking to me and watching over my shoulder and commented that it wasn't necessary because they are the same performance wise.

I was always under the impression that growing the stack was constant time, and heap allocation's performance depended on the current complexity of the heap for both allocation (finding a hole of the proper size) and de-allocating (collapsing holes to reduce fragmentation, as many standard library implementations take time to do this during deletes if I am not mistaken).

This strikes me as something that would probably be very compiler dependent. For this project in particular I am using a Metrowerks compiler for the PPC architecture. Insight on this combination would be most helpful, but in general, for GCC, and MSVC++, what is the case? Is heap allocation not as high performing as stack allocation? Is there no difference? Or are the differences so minute it becomes pointless micro-optimization.

I'm wondering if it's possible to detect whether a browser is running on iOS, similar to how you can feature detect with Modernizr (although this is obviously device detection rather than feature detection).

3882,3975376,"Understanding dict.copy() - shallow or deep?

While reading up the documentation for dict.copy(), it says that it makes a shallow copy of the dictionary. Same goes for the book I am following (Beazley's Python Reference), which says: 


  The m.copy() method makes a shallow
  copy of the items contained in a
  mapping object and places them in a
  new mapping object.


Consider this:

>>> original = dict(a=1, b=2)
>>> new = original.copy()
>>> new.update({'c': 3})
>>> original
{'a': 1, 'b': 2}
>>> new
{'a': 1, 'c': 3, 'b': 2}


So I assumed this would update the value of original (and add 'c': 3) also since I was doing a shallow copy. Like if you do it for a list:

>>> original = [1, 2, 3]
>>> new = original
>>> new.append(4)
>>> new, original
([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4])


This works as expected.

Since both are shallow copies, why is that the dict.copy() doesn't work as I expect it to? Or my understanding of shallow vs deep copying is flawed?

The big piece of the puzzle that I was missing (not directly stated in the answers - at least not at the time of writing this) is that when you do the following:

that does NOT mean that ""john is of type Person and it might be nil"", as I originally thought. I was simply misunderstanding that Person and Person? are completely separate types.  Once I grasped that, all of the other ?, ! madness, and the great answers below, made a lot more sense.

In one of my interviews, I have been asked to explain the difference between an Interface and an Abstract class.

Here's my response:


  Methods of a Java interface are implicitly abstract
   and cannot have implementations. A Java abstract class can have
   instance methods that implements a default behaviour.
  
  Variables declared in a Java interface are by default final. An 
   abstract class may contain non-final variables.
  
  Members of a Java interface are public by default. A Java abstract
   class can have the usual flavours of class members like private,
   protected, etc.
  
  A Java interface should be implemented using keyword “implements”; A
  Java abstract class should be extended using keyword “extends”.
  
  An interface can extend another Java interface only, an abstract class
   can extend another Java class and implement multiple Java interfaces.
  
  A Java class can implement multiple interfaces but it can extend only
   one abstract class.


However, the interviewer was not satisfied, and told me that this description represented ""bookish knowledge"".

He asked me for a more practical response, explaining when I would choose an abstract class over an interface, using practical examples.

It works without the problems on R 2.11. (I launch the script with mpirun -H localhost,n1,n2,n3,n4 -n 1 R --slave -f code.R). Now when I try to do it with R 2.14.2, I get the following message:

Error: This is R 2.11.1, package 'snow' needs >= 2.12.1
In addition: Warning message:


So it seems that R loads the package snow version compiled for R 2.11. I've installed snow under R 2.14 into my home folder and I added the following lines to my code:

.libPaths(""/soft/R/lib/R/library"")
.libPaths(""~/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/2.11"")
print(.libPaths())
print(sessionInfo())
print(version)


And the output before the error confirms that I am indeed running R 2.14.2 and my R packages folder is first in search path. But I still get the error. 

So my question is how do I determine which version of package is loaded in R? I can see with  installed.packages all the packages which are installed, so maybe there is some function which lists similar information for loaded packages?

3914,15313598,"How to correctly save instance state of Fragments in back stack?

I have found many instances of a similar question on SO but no answer unfortunately meets my requirements.

I have different layouts for portrait and landscape and I am using back stack, which both prevents me from using setRetainState() and tricks using configuration change routines.

I show certain information to the user in TextViews, which do not get saved in the default handler. When writing my application solely using Activities, the following worked well:

TextView vstup;

@Override
public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.whatever);
    vstup = (TextView)findViewById(R.id.whatever);
    /* (...) */
}

@Override
public void onSaveInstanceState(Bundle state) {
    super.onSaveInstanceState(state);
    state.putCharSequence(App.VSTUP, vstup.getText());
}

@Override
public void onRestoreInstanceState(Bundle state) {
    super.onRestoreInstanceState(state);
    vstup.setText(state.getCharSequence(App.VSTUP));
}


With Fragments, this works only in very specific situations. Specifically, what breaks horribly is replacing a fragment, putting it in the back stack and then rotating the screen while the new fragment is shown. From what I understood, the old fragment does not receive a call to onSaveInstanceState() when being replaced but stays somehow linked to the Activity and this method is called later when its View does not exist anymore, so looking for any of my TextViews results into a NullPointerException.

Also, I found that keeping the reference to my TextViews is not a good idea with Fragments, even if it was OK with Activity's. In that case, onSaveInstanceState() actually saves the state but the problem reappears if I rotate the screen twice when the fragment is hidden, as its onCreateView() does not get called in the new instance.

I thought of saving the state in onDestroyView() into some Bundle-type class member element (it's actually more data, not just one TextView) and saving that in onSaveInstanceState() but there are other drawbacks. Primarily, if the fragment is currently shown, the order of calling the two functions is reversed, so I'd need to account for two different situations. There must be a cleaner and correct solution!

3918,1111980,"How to handle screen orientation change when progress dialog and background thread active?

My program does some network activity in a background thread. Before starting, it pops up a progress dialog. The dialog is dismissed on the handler. This all works fine, except when screen orientation changes while the dialog is up (and the background thread is going). At this point the app either crashes, or deadlocks, or gets into a weird stage where the app does not work at all until all the threads have been killed.

How can I handle the screen orientation change gracefully?

The sample code below matches roughly what my real program does:

public class MyAct extends Activity implements Runnable {
    public ProgressDialog mProgress;

    // UI has a button that when pressed calls send

    public void send() {
         mProgress = ProgressDialog.show(this, ""Please wait"", 
                      ""Please wait"", 
                      true, true);
        Thread thread = new Thread(this);
        thread.start();
    }

    public void run() {

I have an image, and I want to set it a specific width and height (in pixels)

3949,3550556,"I've found my software as cracked download on Internet, what to do?

So, after 6 months of hard work finally released my application. Today I found the first web site where people download it cracked, and I was wondering if any of you fellow programmers know how to react to such stuff? 

Is there anything the software author can do to get the cracked version offline, or I'm just boned and shouldn't create anymore software, but just work on client's projects? What's your advice? Anybody with experience in that?

edit: programming is what I do- so no question about whether or not continuing, just is that clients pay per project in real money, and I still don't know if indie development would pay at least for the time invested, and now with the cracked download I'm trying to evaluate what to do, and if there's way to react

3950,3937387,"Rotating videos with FFmpeg

I have been trying to figure out how to rotate videos with FFmpeg. I am working with iPhone videos taken in portrait mode. I know how to determine the current degrees of rotation using MediaInfo (excellent library, btw) but I'm stuck on FFmpeg now.

From what I've read, what you need to use is a vfilter option. According to what I see, it should look like this:

ffmpeg -vfilters ""rotate=90"" -i input.mp4 output.mp4


However, I can't get this to work. First, -vfilters doesn't exist anymore, it's now just -vf. Second, I get this error:

No such filter: 'rotate'
Error opening filters!


As far as I know, I have an all-options-on build of FFmpeg. Running ffmpeg -filters shows this:

Filters:
anull            Pass the source unchanged to the output.
aspect           Set the frame aspect ratio.
crop             Crop the input video to x:y:width:height.
fifo             Buffer input images and send them when they are requested.
format           Convert the input video to one of the specified pixel formats.
hflip            Horizontally flip the input video.
noformat         Force libavfilter not to use any of the specified pixel formats
 for the input to the next filter.
null             Pass the source unchanged to the output.
pad              Pad input image to width:height[:x:y[:color]] (default x and y:
 0, default color: black).
pixdesctest      Test pixel format definitions.
pixelaspect      Set the pixel aspect ratio.
scale            Scale the input video to width:height size and/or convert the i
mage format.
slicify          Pass the images of input video on to next video filter as multi
ple slices.
unsharp          Sharpen or blur the input video.
vflip            Flip the input video vertically.
buffer           Buffer video frames, and make them accessible to the filterchai
n.
color            Provide an uniformly colored input, syntax is: [color[:size[:ra
te]]]
nullsrc          Null video source, never return images.
nullsink         Do absolutely nothing with the input video.


Having the options for vflip and hflip are great and all, but they just won't get me where I need to go. I need to the ability to rotate videos 90 degrees at the very least. 270 degrees would be an excellent option to have as well. Where have the rotate options gone?

Is there any way to make an expression for something like ng-class to be a conditional?

For example, I have tried the following:

<span ng-class=""{test: 'obj.value1 == \'someothervalue\''}"">test</span>


The issue with this code is that no matter what obj.value1 is, the class test is always applied to the element. Doing this:

<span ng-class=""{test: obj.value2}"">test</span>


As long as obj.value2 does not equal a truthy value, the class in not applied.  Now I can work around the issue in the first example by doing this:

<span ng-class=""{test: checkValue1()}"">test</span>

$scope.checkValue1 = function() {

3992,1476295,"When to use MongoDB or other document oriented database systems?

We offer a platform for video- and audio-clips, photos and vector-grafics. We started with MySQL as the database backend and recently included MongoDB for storing all meta-information of the files, because MongoDB better fits the requirements. For example: photos may have Exif information, videos may have audio-tracks where we to want to store the meta-information of, too. Videos and vector-graphics don't share any common meta-information, etc. so I know, that MongoDB is perfect to store this unstructured data and keep it searchable.

However, we continue developing our platform and adding features. Now one of the next steps will be providing a forum for our users. The question that now arises is: use the MySQL database, which would be a good choice for storing forums and forum-posts, etc. or use MongoDB for this, too?

So the question is: when to use MongoDB and when to use a RDBMS. What would you take, mongoDB or MySQL, if you had the choice and why would you take it?

But since this is called in the CustomButton class, the parent can vary from LinearLayout to TableLayout, and I'd rather not have him get his parent and check the instanceof that parent. That'll also be quite inperformant, I imagine.

Also, when calling (using LayoutParams) parentLayout.addView(myCustomButton, newParams), I don't know if this adds it to the correct position (haven't tried however), say the middle button of a row of five.

Question: Is there any easier way to set the margin of a single Button programmatically besides using LayoutParams?

EDIT: I know of the LayoutParams way, but I'd like a solution that avoids handling each different container type:

ViewGroup.LayoutParams p = this.getLayoutParams();
    if (p instanceof LinearLayout.LayoutParams) {
        LinearLayout.LayoutParams lp = (LinearLayout.LayoutParams)p;
        if (_default) lp.setMargins(mc.oml, mc.omt, mc.omr, mc.omb);
        else lp.setMargins(mc.ml, mc.mt, mc.mr, mc.mb);
        this.setLayoutParams(lp);
    }
    else if (p instanceof RelativeLayout.LayoutParams) {
        RelativeLayout.LayoutParams lp = (RelativeLayout.LayoutParams)p;
        if (_default) lp.setMargins(mc.oml, mc.omt, mc.omr, mc.omb);
        else lp.setMargins(mc.ml, mc.mt, mc.mr, mc.mb);
        this.setLayoutParams(lp);
    }
    else if (p instanceof TableRow.LayoutParams) {
        TableRow.LayoutParams lp = (TableRow.LayoutParams)p;
        if (_default) lp.setMargins(mc.oml, mc.omt, mc.omr, mc.omb);
        else lp.setMargins(mc.ml, mc.mt, mc.mr, mc.mb);
        this.setLayoutParams(lp);
    }
}


Because this.getLayoutParams();returns a ViewGroup.LayoutParams, which do not have the attributes topMargin, bottomMargin, leftMargin, rightMargin.
The mc instance you see is just a MarginContainer which contains offset (-3dp) margins and (oml, omr, omt, omb) and the original margins (ml, mr, mt, mb).

There are a lot of questions here related to Bootstrap. I see a lot of people using it.

4042,35945001,"Binding select element to object in Angular

I'd like to bind a select element to a list of objects -- which is easy enough:
@Component({
   selector: 'myApp',
   template: 
      `<h1>My Application</h1>
       <select [(ngModel)]=""selectedValue"">
          <option *ngFor=""#c of countries"" value=""c.id"">{{c.name}}</option>
       </select>`
    })
export class AppComponent{
   countries = [
      {id: 1, name: ""United States""},
      {id: 2, name: ""Australia""}
      {id: 3, name: ""Canada""},
      {id: 4, name: ""Brazil""},
      {id: 5, name: ""England""}
   ];
   selectedValue = null;
}

In this case, it appears that selectedValue would be a number -- the id of the selected item.
However, I'd actually like to bind to the country object itself so that selectedValue is the object rather than just the id.  I tried changing the value of the option like so:
<option *ngFor=""#c of countries"" value=""c"">{{c.name}}</option>

but this does not seem to work.  It seems to place an object in my selectedValue -- but not the object that I'm expecting.  You can see this in my Plunker example.
I also tried binding to the change event so that I could set the object myself based on the selected id; however, it appears that the change event fires before the bound ngModel is updated -- meaning I don't have access to the newly selected value at that point.
Is there a clean way to bind a select element to an object with Angular 2?

4066,2703102,"typeof !== ""undefined"" vs. != null

I often see JavaScript code which checks for undefined parameters etc. this way:

if (typeof input !== ""undefined"") {

This seems kind of wasteful, since it involves both a type lookup and a string comparison, not to mention its verbosity. It's needed because undefined could be renamed, though. 

My question is:
How is that code any better than this approach:

if (null != input) {
    // do stuff
}


As far as I know, you can't redefine null, so it's not going to break unexpectedly. And, because of the type-coercion of the != operator, this checks for both undefined and null... which is often exactly what you want (e.g. for optional function parameters). 

Yet this form does not seem widespread, and it even causes JSLint to yell at you for using the evil != operator. 

Why is this considered bad style?

4077,150750,"HashSet vs. List performance

It's clear that a search performance of the generic HashSet<T> class is higher than of the generic List<T> class. Just compare the hash-based key with the linear approach in the List<T> class.

However calculating a hash key may itself take some CPU cycles, so for a small amount of items the linear search can be a real alternative to the HashSet<T>.

My question: where is the break-even?

To simplify the scenario (and to be fair) let's assume that the List<T> class uses the element's Equals() method to identify an item.

4078,390250,"Elegant ways to support equivalence (""equality"") in Python classes

When writing custom classes it is often important to allow equivalence by means of the == and != operators. In Python, this is made possible by implementing the __eq__ and __ne__ special methods, respectively. The easiest way I've found to do this is the following method:

class Foo:
    def __init__(self, item):
        self.item = item

    def __eq__(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, self.__class__):
            return self.__dict__ == other.__dict__
        else:
            return False

    def __ne__(self, other):
        return not self.__eq__(other)


Do you know of more elegant means of doing this? Do you know of any particular disadvantages to using the above method of comparing __dict__s?

Note: A bit of clarification--when __eq__ and __ne__ are undefined, you'll find this behavior:

>>> a = Foo(1)
>>> b = Foo(1)
>>> a is b
False
>>> a == b
False


That is, a == b evaluates to False because it really runs a is b, a test of identity (i.e., ""Is a the same object as b?"").

When __eq__ and __ne__ are defined, you'll find this behavior (which is the one we're after):

>>> a = Foo(1)
>>> b = Foo(1)
>>> a is b
False
>>> a == b
True

4094,1820908,"How to turn off the Eclipse code formatter for certain sections of Java code?

I've got some Java code with SQL statements written as Java strings (please no OR/M flamewars, the embedded SQL is what it is - not my decision).

I've broken the SQL statements semantically into several concatenated strings over several lines of code for ease of maintenance. So instead of something like:

String query = ""SELECT FOO, BAR, BAZ FROM ABC WHERE BAR > 4"";


I have something like:

String query =
    ""SELECT FOO, BAR, BAZ"" +
    ""  FROM ABC          "" +
    "" WHERE BAR > 4      "";


This style makes the SQL much easier to read and maintain (IMHO), especially for larger queries. For example, I can put my editor into ""overwrite"" mode and modify the text in-place fairly easily.

Note that this issue generalizes beyond the particular example of SQL. Any code that is written with any vertical formatting, particularly tabular constructs, is susceptible to destruction by a pretty printer.

Now, some project members use the Eclipse editor and the semantic formatting is often destroyed when they format an entire source file.

Is there a way to instruct Eclipse to ignore certain lines of source with respect to formatting?

I'm looking for something like a special comment that toggles the Eclipse formatter. Ideally, such a comment could be configurable to be whatever we choose, and other formatters could be programmed to respect it as well:

// STOP-ECLIPSE-FORMATTING
String query =
    ""SELECT FOO, BAR, BAZ"" +
    ""  FROM ABC          "" +
    "" WHERE BAR > 4      "";
// START-ECLIPSE-FORMATTING


Obviously, one ""solution"" is to have our team members standardize on some external formatter like Jalopy or JIndent, but that's not what this question is about (also, not my decision on this project): I'm specifically looking for a way to avoid the Eclipse formatter on an ad-hoc basis.

Ideally, a solution will allow me to insert instructions for the Eclipse formatter without requiring team members using Eclipse to do any IDE reconfiguration (other than possibly choosing a formatter agnostic command comment: STOP-ECLIPSE-FORMATTING → STOP-FORMATTING).

Please avoid bloat macro-based answer, or try to reduce the #define overhead as minimum as possible.
Please no manual enum -> string mapping.

Nice to have

Support enum values starting from a number different from zero
Support negative enum values
Support fragmented enum values
Support class enum (C++11)
Support class enum : <type> having any allowed <type> (C++11)
Compile-time (not run-time) conversions to a string,
or at least fast execution at run-time (e.g. std::map is not a great idea...)
constexpr (C++11, then relaxed in C++14/17/20)
noexcept (C++11)
C++17/C++20 friendly snippet

One possible idea could be using the C++ compiler capabilities to generate C++ code at compilation-time using meta-programming tricks based on variadic template class and constexpr functions...

I've got a two column CSV with a name and a number. Some people's name use commas, for example Joe Blow, CFA. This comma breaks the CSV format, since it's interpreted as a new column.

I've read up and the most common prescription seems to be replacing that character, or replacing the delimiter, with a new value (e.g. this|that|the, other).

I'd really like to keep the comma separator (I know excel supports other delimiters but other interpreters may not). I'd also like to keep the comma in the name, as Joe Blow| CFA looks pretty silly.

4153,11743392,"How to check if an array is empty or exists?

When the page is loading for the first time, I need to check if there is an image in image_array and load the last image.

Otherwise, I disable the preview buttons, alert the user to push new image button and create an empty array to put the images;

The problem is that image_array in the else fires all time. If an array exists - it just overrides it, but alert doesn't work.

if(image_array.length > 0)
    $('#images').append('<img src=""'+image_array[image_array.length-1]+'"" class=""images"" id=""1"" />');

Before loading html, I have something like this:

<?php if(count($images) != 0): ?>
<script type=""text/javascript"">
    <?php echo ""image_array = "".json_encode($images);?>

I am trying to install a Python package from a private GitHub repository. For a public repository, I can issue the following command which works fine:

However, if I try this for a private repository:

I am designing a new website and I want it to be compatible with as much browsers and browser settings as possible. I am trying to decide what unit of measurement I should use for the sizes of my fonts and elements, but am unable to find a conclusive answer.
My question is: should I use px or rem in my CSS?

So far I know that using px isn't compatible with users who adjust their base font size in their browser.
I've disregarded ems because they are more of a hassle to maintain, compared to rems, as they cascade.
Some say that rems are resolution independent and therefore more desirable. But others say that most modern browsers zoom all elements equally anyway, so using px is not a problem.

I'm asking this because there are a lot of different opinions as to what is the most desirable measure of distance in CSS, and I am not sure which is best.

4198,51936369,"What is the Record type?

What does Record<K, T> mean in Typescript?
Typescript 2.1 introduced the Record type, describing it in an example:

// For every properties K of type T, transform it to U
function mapObject<K extends string, T, U>(obj: Record<K, T>, f: (x: T) => U): Record<K, U>


see Typescript 2.1
And the Advanced Types page mentions Record under the Mapped Types heading alongside Readonly, Partial, and Pick, in what appears to be its definition:

type Record<K extends string, T> = {
    [P in K]: T;
}



Readonly, Partial and Pick are homomorphic whereas Record is not. One clue that Record is not homomorphic is that it doesn’t take an input type to copy properties from:
type ThreeStringProps = Record<'prop1' | 'prop2' | 'prop3', string>


And that's it. Besides the above quotes, there is no other mention of Record on typescriptlang.org.
Questions

Can someone give a simple definition of what Record is?

Is Record<K,T> merely a way of saying ""all properties on this object will have type T""? Probably not all properties, since K has some purpose...

Does the K generic forbid additional keys on the object that are not K, or does it allow them and just indicate that their properties are not transformed to T?

With the given example:
type ThreeStringProps = Record<'prop1' | 'prop2' | 'prop3', string>

Is it exactly the same as this?:
type ThreeStringProps = {prop1: string, prop2: string, prop3: string}

4226,18391212,"Is it not possible to stringify an Error using JSON.stringify?

Reproducing the problem

I'm running into an issue when trying to pass error messages around using web sockets. I can replicate the issue I am facing using JSON.stringify to cater to a wider audience:

// node v0.10.15
> var error = new Error('simple error message');
    undefined

> error
    [Error: simple error message]

> Object.getOwnPropertyNames(error);
    [ 'stack', 'arguments', 'type', 'message' ]

> JSON.stringify(error);
    '{}'


The problem is that I end up with an empty object.

What I've tried

Browsers

I first tried leaving node.js and running it in various browsers. Chrome version 28 gives me the same result, and interestingly enough, Firefox at least makes an attempt but left out the message:

>>> JSON.stringify(error); // Firebug, Firefox 23
{""fileName"":""debug eval code"",""lineNumber"":1,""stack"":""@debug eval code:1\n""}


Replacer function

I then looked at the Error.prototype. It shows that the prototype contains methods such as toString and toSource. Knowing that functions can't be stringified, I included a replacer function when calling JSON.stringify to remove all functions, but then realized that it too had some weird behavior:

var error = new Error('simple error message');
JSON.stringify(error, function(key, value) {
    console.log(key === ''); // true (?)
    console.log(value === error); // true (?)
});


It doesn't seem to loop over the object as it normally would, and therefore I can't check if the key is a function and ignore it.

The Question

Is there any way to stringify native Error messages with JSON.stringify? If not, why does this behavior occur?

Methods of getting around this


Stick with simple string-based error messages, or create personal error objects and don't rely on the native Error object.
Pull properties: JSON.stringify({ message: error.message, stack: error.stack })


Updates

@Ray Toal Suggested in a comment that I take a look at the property descriptors. It is clear now why it does not work:

var error = new Error('simple error message');
var propertyNames = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(error);
var descriptor;
for (var property, i = 0, len = propertyNames.length; i < len; ++i) {
    property = propertyNames[i];
    descriptor = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(error, property);
    console.log(property, descriptor);
}


Output:

4233,5364050,"Reloading submodules in IPython

Currently I am working on a python project that contains sub modules and uses numpy/scipy. Ipython is used as interactive console. Unfortunately I am not very happy with workflow that I am using right now, I would appreciate some advice.

In IPython, the framework is loaded by a simple import command. However, it is often necessary to change code in one of the submodules of the framework. At this point a model is already loaded and I use IPython to interact with it. 

Now, the framework contains many modules that depend on each other, i.e. when the framework is initially loaded the main module is importing and configuring the submodules.  The changes to the code are only executed if the module is reloaded using reload(main_mod.sub_mod). This is cumbersome as I need to reload all changed modules individually using the full path. It would be very convenient if reload(main_module) would also reload all sub modules, but without reloading numpy/scipy..

C++ inherited arrays from C where they are used virtually everywhere. C++ provides abstractions that are easier to use and less error-prone (std::vector<T> since C++98 and std::array<T, n> since C++11), so the need for arrays does not arise quite as often as it does in C. However, when you read legacy code or interact with a library written in C, you should have a firm grasp on how arrays work.
This FAQ is split into five parts:

arrays on the type level and accessing elements
array creation and initialization
assignment and parameter passing
multidimensional arrays and arrays of pointers
common pitfalls when using arrays

If you feel something important is missing in this FAQ, write an answer and link it here as an additional part.

4257,39174989,"How to register multiple implementations of the same interface in Asp.Net Core?

I have services that are derived from the same interface.

public interface IService { }
public class ServiceA : IService { }

public class ServiceC : IService { }


Typically, other IoC containers like Unity allow you to register concrete implementations by some Key that distinguishes them.

In ASP.NET Core, how do I register these services and resolve them at runtime based on some key?   

I don't see any Add Service methods that take a key or name parameter, which would typically be used to distinguish the concrete implementation.

    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {            
         // How do I register services of the same interface?

       public void DoSomething(string key)
       { 
          // How do I resolve the service by key?
       }
    }


Is the Factory pattern the only option here?

Update1
I have gone though the article here that shows how to use the factory pattern to get service instances when we have multiple concrete implementations. However, it is still not a complete solution.  When I call the _serviceProvider.GetService() method, I cannot inject data into the constructor. 

For example consider this:

public class ServiceA : IService
{
     private string _efConnectionString;
     ServiceA(string efconnectionString)
     {
       _efConnecttionString = efConnectionString;
     } 
}

public class ServiceB : IService
{    
   private string _mongoConnectionString;
   public ServiceB(string mongoConnectionString)
   {
      _mongoConnectionString = mongoConnectionString;
   }
}

public class ServiceC : IService
{    
    private string _someOtherConnectionString
    public ServiceC(string someOtherConnectionString)
    {
      _someOtherConnectionString = someOtherConnectionString;
    }
}


How can _serviceProvider.GetService() inject the appropriate connection string?
In Unity, or any other IoC library, we can do that at type registration. I can use IOption, however, that will require me to inject all settings.  I cannot inject a particular connection string into the service.

Also note that I am trying to avoid using other containers (including Unity) because then I have to register everything else (e.g., Controllers) with the new container as well.

Also, using the factory pattern to create service instances is against DIP, as it increases the number of dependencies a client has details here.

So, I think the default DI in ASP.NET Core is missing two things:


The ability to register instances using a key
The ability to inject static data into constructors during registration

Fragments seem to be very nice for separation of UI logic into some modules. But along with ViewPager its lifecycle is still misty to me. So Guru thoughts are badly needed! 

Edit

See dumb solution below ;-)

Scope

Main activity has a ViewPager with fragments. Those fragments could implement a little bit different logic for other (submain) activities, so the fragments' data is filled via a callback interface inside the activity. And everything works fine on first launch, but!...

Problem

When the activity gets recreated (e.g. on orientation change) so do the ViewPager's fragments. The code (you'll find below) says that every time the activity is created I try to create a new ViewPager fragments adapter the same as fragments (maybe this is the problem) but FragmentManager already has all these fragments stored somewhere (where?) and starts the recreation mechanism for those. So the recreation mechanism calls the ""old"" fragment's onAttach, onCreateView, etc. with my callback interface call for initiating data via the Activity's implemented method. But this method points to the newly created fragment which is created via the Activity's onCreate method.

Issue

Maybe I'm using wrong patterns but even Android 3 Pro book doesn't have much about it. So, please, give me one-two punch and point out how to do it the right way. Many thanks!

Code

Main Activity

public class DashboardActivity extends BasePagerActivity implements OnMessageListActionListener {

private MessagesFragment mMessagesFragment;

@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    Logger.d(""Dash onCreate"");
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

    setContentView(R.layout.viewpager_container);
    new DefaultToolbar(this);

    // create fragments to use
    mMessagesFragment = new MessagesFragment();
    mStreamsFragment = new StreamsFragment();

    // set titles and fragments for view pager
    Map<String, Fragment> screens = new LinkedHashMap<String, Fragment>();
    screens.put(getApplicationContext().getString(R.string.dashboard_title_dumb), new DumbFragment());
    screens.put(getApplicationContext().getString(R.string.dashboard_title_messages), mMessagesFragment);

    // instantiate view pager via adapter
    mPager = (ViewPager) findViewById(R.id.viewpager_pager);
    mPagerAdapter = new BasePagerAdapter(screens, getSupportFragmentManager());
    mPager.setAdapter(mPagerAdapter);

    // set title indicator
    TitlePageIndicator indicator = (TitlePageIndicator) findViewById(R.id.viewpager_titles);
    indicator.setViewPager(mPager, 1);

}

/* set of fragments callback interface implementations */

@Override
public void onMessageInitialisation() {

    Logger.d(""Dash onMessageInitialisation"");
    if (mMessagesFragment != null)
        mMessagesFragment.loadLastMessages();
}

@Override
public void onMessageSelected(Message selectedMessage) {

    Intent intent = new Intent(this, StreamActivity.class);
    intent.putExtra(Message.class.getName(), selectedMessage);
    startActivity(intent);
}


BasePagerActivity aka helper

public class BasePagerActivity extends FragmentActivity {

BasePagerAdapter mPagerAdapter;
ViewPager mPager;
}


Adapter

public class BasePagerAdapter extends FragmentPagerAdapter implements TitleProvider {

private Map<String, Fragment> mScreens;

public BasePagerAdapter(Map<String, Fragment> screenMap, FragmentManager fm) {

    super(fm);
    this.mScreens = screenMap;
}

@Override
public Fragment getItem(int position) {

    return mScreens.values().toArray(new Fragment[mScreens.size()])[position];
}

@Override
public int getCount() {

    return mScreens.size();
}

@Override
public String getTitle(int position) {

    return mScreens.keySet().toArray(new String[mScreens.size()])[position];
}

// hack. we don't want to destroy our fragments and re-initiate them after
@Override
public void destroyItem(View container, int position, Object object) {

    // TODO Auto-generated method stub
}

}


Fragment

public class MessagesFragment extends ListFragment {

private boolean mIsLastMessages;

private List<Message> mMessagesList;
private MessageArrayAdapter mAdapter;

private LoadMessagesTask mLoadMessagesTask;
private OnMessageListActionListener mListener;

// define callback interface
public interface OnMessageListActionListener {
    public void onMessageInitialisation();
    public void onMessageSelected(Message selectedMessage);
}

@Override
public void onAttach(Activity activity) {
    super.onAttach(activity);
    // setting callback
    mListener = (OnMessageListActionListener) activity;
    mIsLastMessages = activity instanceof DashboardActivity;

}

@Override
public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container, Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    inflater.inflate(R.layout.fragment_listview, container);
    mProgressView = inflater.inflate(R.layout.listrow_progress, null);
    mEmptyView = inflater.inflate(R.layout.fragment_nodata, null);
    return super.onCreateView(inflater, container, savedInstanceState);
}

@Override
public void onActivityCreated(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onActivityCreated(savedInstanceState);

    // instantiate loading task
    mLoadMessagesTask = new LoadMessagesTask();

    // instantiate list of messages
    mMessagesList = new ArrayList<Message>();
    mAdapter = new MessageArrayAdapter(getActivity(), mMessagesList);
    setListAdapter(mAdapter);
}

@Override
public void onResume() {
    mListener.onMessageInitialisation();
    super.onResume();
}

public void onListItemClick(ListView l, View v, int position, long id) {
    Message selectedMessage = (Message) getListAdapter().getItem(position);
    mListener.onMessageSelected(selectedMessage);
    super.onListItemClick(l, v, position, id);
}

/* public methods to load messages from host acitivity, etc... */
}


Solution

The dumb solution is to save the fragments inside onSaveInstanceState (of host Activity) with putFragment and get them inside onCreate via getFragment. But I still have a strange feeling that things shouldn't work like that... See code below:

    @Override
protected void onSaveInstanceState(Bundle outState) {

    super.onSaveInstanceState(outState);
    getSupportFragmentManager()
            .putFragment(outState, MessagesFragment.class.getName(), mMessagesFragment);
}

protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    Logger.d(""Dash onCreate"");
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

    ...
    // create fragments to use
    if (savedInstanceState != null) {
        mMessagesFragment = (MessagesFragment) getSupportFragmentManager().getFragment(
                savedInstanceState, MessagesFragment.class.getName());
                StreamsFragment.class.getName());
    }
    if (mMessagesFragment == null)
        mMessagesFragment = new MessagesFragment();
    ...
}

4269,10856129,"Setting an environment variable before a command in Bash is not working for the second command in a pipe

In a given shell, normally I'd set a variable or variables and then run a command. Recently I learned about the concept of prepending a variable definition to a command:
FOO=bar somecommand someargs

This works... kind of. It doesn't work when you're changing a LC_* variable (which seems to affect the command, but not its arguments, for example, [a-z] char ranges) or when piping output to another command thusly:
FOO=bar somecommand someargs | somecommand2  # somecommand2 is unaware of FOO

I can prepend somecommand2 with FOO=bar as well, which works, but which adds unwanted duplication, and it doesn't help with arguments that are interpreted depending on the variable (for example, [a-z]).
So, what's a good way to do this on a single line?
I'm thinking something on the order of:
FOO=bar (somecommand someargs | somecommand2)  # Doesn't actually work


I got lots of good answers! The goal is to keep this a one-liner, preferably without using export. The method using a call to Bash was best overall, though the parenthetical version with export in it was a little more compact. The method of using redirection rather than a pipe is interesting as well.

    //Get the response context, flush it and get the response filter.

4313,14507591,"Python Dictionary Comprehension

Is it possible to create a dictionary comprehension in Python (for the keys)?

Without list comprehensions, you can use something like this:

l = []
for n in range(1, 11):
    l.append(n)


We can shorten this to a list comprehension: l = [n for n in range(1, 11)].

However, say I want to set a dictionary's keys to the same value.
I can do:

d = {}
for n in range(1, 11):

I've tried this:

d = {}
d[i for i in range(1, 11)] = True


However, I get a SyntaxError on the for.

In addition (I don't need this part, but just wondering), can you set a dictionary's keys to a bunch of different values, like this:

What does the (h handler) and the (s *GracefulServer) between parenthesis mean? What does the entire function declaration mean, taking into account the meaning of the things between parenthesis?
Edit
This is not a duplicate of Whats the difference of functions and methods in Go? : this question came to me because I didn't know what the things in parenthesis before the function name were, not because I wondered what was the difference between functions and methods... if I knew that this declaration was a method I wouldn't have had this question in the first place. If someone has the same doubt as me one day, I don't believe she will go searching for ""golang methods"" because she doesn't know that this is the case. It would be like wondering what the letter ""sigma"" means before a mathematical expression (not knowing it means summation) and someone says it's a duplicate of what's the difference between summation and some other thing.
Also, the short answer to this question (""it's a receiver"") is no answer to ""what's the difference between functions and methods"".

4325,2176424,"Hiding axis text in matplotlib plots

I'm trying to plot a figure without tickmarks or numbers on either of the axes (I use axes in the traditional sense, not the matplotlib nomenclature!). An issue I have come across is where matplotlib adjusts the x(y)ticklabels by subtracting a value N, then adds N at the end of the axis.

This may be vague, but the following simplified example highlights the issue, with '6.18' being the offending value of N:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import random
prefix = 6.18

rx = [prefix+(0.001*random.random()) for i in arange(100)]
ry = [prefix+(0.001*random.random()) for i in arange(100)]
plt.plot(rx,ry,'ko')

frame1 = plt.gca()
for xlabel_i in frame1.axes.get_xticklabels():
    xlabel_i.set_visible(False)
    xlabel_i.set_fontsize(0.0)
for xlabel_i in frame1.axes.get_yticklabels():
    xlabel_i.set_fontsize(0.0)
    xlabel_i.set_visible(False)
for tick in frame1.axes.get_xticklines():
    tick.set_visible(False)
for tick in frame1.axes.get_yticklines():
    tick.set_visible(False)

plt.show()


The three things I would like to know are:

4329,7229226,"Should I avoid the use of set(Preferred|Maximum|Minimum)Size methods in Java Swing?

Several times I've been criticized for having suggested the use of the following methods:

setMaximumSize


on Swing components. I don't see any alternative to their use when I want to define proportions between displayed components. I have been told this:


  With layouts the answer is always the same: use a suitable
  LayoutManager


I have searched the web a little bit, but I haven't found any comprehensive analysis of the subject. So I have the following questions:


Should I completely avoid the use of those methods?
The methods have been defined for a reason. So when should I use them? In which context? For what purposes? 
What exactly are the negative consequences of using those methods? (I can only think adding portability between systems with different screen resolution).
I don't think any LayoutManager can exactly satisfy all desired layout needs. Do I really need to implement a new LayoutManager for every little variation on my layout ? 
If the answer to 4 is ""yes"", won't this lead to a proliferation of LayoutManager classes which will become difficult to maintain?
In a situation where I need to define proportions between children of a Component (eg, child1 should use 10% of space, child2 40% ,child3 50%), is it possible to achieve that without implementing a custom LayoutManager?

4331,12863663,"Complex nesting of partials and templates

My question involves how to go about dealing with complex nesting of templates (also called partials) in an AngularJS application.

The best way to describe my situation is with an image I created:



As you can see this has the potential to be a fairly complex application with lots of nested models.

The application is single-page, so it loads an index.html that contains a div element in the DOM with the ng-view attribute.

For circle 1, You see that there is a Primary navigation that loads the appropriate templates into the ng-view.  I'm doing this by passing $routeParams to the main app module.  Here is an example of what's in my app:

angular.module('myApp', []).
    config(['$routeProvider', function($routeProvider) {
        $routeProvider.                     
            when(""/job/:jobId/zones/:zoneId"", { controller: JobDetailController, templateUrl: 'assets/job_list_app/templates/zone_edit.html' }).
            when(""/job/:jobId/initial_inspection"", { controller: JobDetailController, templateUrl: 'assets/job_list_app/templates/initial_inspection.html' }).
            when(""/job/:jobId/zones/:zoneId/rooms/:roomId"", { controller: JobDetailController, templateUrl: 'assets/job_list_app/templates/room_edit.html' })       

    }]);


In circle 2, the template that is loaded into the ng-view has an additional sub-navigation.  This sub-nav then needs to load templates into the area below it - but since ng-view is already being used, I'm not sure how to go about doing this.

I know that I can include additional templates within the 1st template, but these templates are all going to be pretty complex.  I would like to keep all the templates separate in order to make the application easier to update and not have a dependency on the parent template having to be loaded in order to access its children.

In circle 3, you can see things get even more complex.  There is the potential that the sub-navigation templates will have a 2nd sub-navigation that will need to load its own templates as well into the area in circle 4

How does one go about structuring an AngularJS app to deal with such complex nesting of templates while keeping them all separate from one another?

Or not create filter and in each request put a param token? So that each API first checks the token and after executes something to retrieve resource.

4345,577554,"When is assembly faster than C?

One of the stated reasons for knowing assembler is that, on occasion, it can be employed to write code that will be more performant than writing that code in a higher-level language, C in particular.  However, I've also heard it stated many times that although that's not entirely false, the cases where assembler can actually be used to generate more performant code are both extremely rare and require expert knowledge of and experience with assembly.  

This question doesn't even get into the fact that assembler instructions will be machine-specific and non-portable, or any of the other aspects of assembler.  There are plenty of good reasons for knowing assembly besides this one, of course, but this is meant to be a specific question soliciting examples and data, not an extended discourse on assembler versus higher-level languages.

Can anyone provide some specific examples of cases where assembly will be faster than well-written C code using a modern compiler, and can you support that claim with profiling evidence?  I am pretty confident these cases exist, but I really want to know exactly how esoteric these cases are, since it seems to be a point of some contention.

4350,19470873,"Why does GCC generate 15-20% faster code if I optimize for size instead of speed?

I first noticed in 2009 that GCC (at least on my projects and on my machines) have the tendency to generate noticeably faster code if I optimize for size (-Os) instead of speed (-O2 or -O3), and I have been wondering ever since why.

I have managed to create (rather silly) code that shows this surprising behavior and is sufficiently small to be posted here.

const int LOOP_BOUND = 200000000;

__attribute__((noinline))
static int add(const int& x, const int& y) {
    return x + y;
}

__attribute__((noinline))
static int work(int xval, int yval) {
    int sum(0);
    for (int i=0; i<LOOP_BOUND; ++i) {
        int x(xval+sum);
        int y(yval+sum);
        int z = add(x, y);
        sum += z;
    }
    return sum;
}

int main(int , char* argv[]) {
    int result = work(*argv[1], *argv[2]);
    return result;
}


If I compile it with -Os, it takes 0.38 s to execute this program, and 0.44 s if it is compiled with -O2 or -O3. These times are obtained consistently and with practically no noise (gcc 4.7.2, x86_64 GNU/Linux, Intel Core i5-3320M).

(Update: I have moved all assembly code to GitHub: They made the post bloated and apparently add very little value to the questions as the fno-align-* flags have the same effect.)

Here is the generated assembly with -Os and -O2.

Unfortunately, my understanding of assembly is very limited, so I have no idea whether what I did next was correct: I grabbed the assembly for -O2 and merged all its differences into the assembly for -Os except the .p2align lines, result here. This code still runs in 0.38s and the only difference is the .p2align stuff.

If I guess correctly, these are paddings for stack alignment. According to Why does GCC pad functions with NOPs? it is done in the hope that the code will run faster, but apparently this optimization backfired in my case.

Is it the padding that is the culprit in this case? Why and how?

The noise it makes pretty much makes timing micro-optimizations impossible.

How can I make sure that such accidental lucky / unlucky alignments are not interfering when I do micro-optimizations (unrelated to stack alignment) on C or C++ source code?



UPDATE:

Following Pascal Cuoq's answer I tinkered a little bit with the alignments. By passing -O2 -fno-align-functions -fno-align-loops to gcc, all .p2align are gone from the assembly and the generated executable runs in 0.38s. According to the gcc documentation:


  -Os enables all -O2 optimizations [but] -Os disables the following optimization flags:

  -falign-functions  -falign-jumps  -falign-loops
  -falign-labels  -freorder-blocks  -freorder-blocks-and-partition
  -fprefetch-loop-arrays



So, it pretty much seems like a (mis)alignment issue.

I am still skeptical about -march=native as suggested in Marat Dukhan's answer. I am not convinced that it isn't just interfering with this (mis)alignment issue; it has absolutely no effect on my machine. (Nevertheless, I upvoted his answer.)



UPDATE 2:

We can take -Os out of the picture. The following times are obtained by compiling with


-O2 -fno-omit-frame-pointer 0.37s
-O2 -fno-align-functions -fno-align-loops 0.37s
-S -O2 then manually moving the assembly of add() after work() 0.37s
-O2 0.44s


It looks like to me the distance of add() from the call site matters a lot. I have tried perf, but the output of perf stat and perf report makes very little sense to me. However, I could only get one consistent result out of it:

It looks like we are stalling on the call to add() in the slow case.

I have examined everything that perf -e can spit out on my machine; not just the stats that are given above.

For the same executable, the stalled-cycles-frontend shows linear correlation with the execution time; I did not notice anything else that would correlate so clearly. (Comparing stalled-cycles-frontend for different executables doesn't make sense to me.)

I included the cache misses as it came up as the first comment. I examined all the cache misses that can be measured on my machine by perf, not just the ones given above. The cache misses are very very noisy and show little to no correlation with the execution times.

For the sake of discussion let see some code.
CREATE TABLE parent (

);

For ON DELETE CASCADE, if a parent with an id is deleted, a record in child with parent_id = parent.id will be automatically deleted. This should be no problem.

This means that ON UPDATE CASCADE will do the same thing when id of the parent is updated?

If (1) is true, it means that there is no need to use ON UPDATE CASCADE if parent.id is not updatable (or will never be updated) like when it is AUTO_INCREMENT or always set to be TIMESTAMP. Is that right?

If (2) is not true, in what other kind of situation should we use ON UPDATE CASCADE?

What if I (for some reason) update the child.parent_id to be something not existing, will it then be automatically deleted?

"
4374,450835,"Stopping scripters from slamming your website


I've accepted an answer, but sadly, I believe we're stuck with our original worst case scenario: CAPTCHA everyone on purchase attempts of the crap. Short explanation: caching / web farms make it impossible to track hits, and any workaround (sending a non-cached web-beacon, writing to a unified table, etc.) slows the site down worse than the bots would. There is likely some pricey hardware from Cisco or the like that can help at a high level, but it's hard to justify the cost if CAPTCHA-ing everyone is an alternative. I'll attempt a more full explanation later, as well as cleaning this up for future searchers (though others are welcome to try, as it's community wiki).

Situation
This is about the bag o' crap sales on woot.com. I'm the president of Woot Workshop, the subsidiary of Woot that does the design, writes the product descriptions, podcasts, blog posts, and moderates the forums. I work with CSS/HTML and am only barely familiar with other technologies. I work closely with the developers and have talked through all of the answers here (and many other ideas we've had).
Usability is a massive part of my job, and making the site exciting and fun is most of the rest of it. That's where the three goals below derive. CAPTCHA harms usability, and bots steal the fun and excitement out of our crap sales.
Bots are slamming our front page tens of times a second screen scraping (and/or scanning our RSS) for the Random Crap sale. The moment they see that, it triggers a second stage of the program that logs in, clicks I want One, fills out the form, and buys the crap.
Evaluation

lc: On stackoverflow and other sites that use this method, they're almost always dealing with authenticated (logged in) users, because the task being attempted requires that.

On Woot, anonymous (non-logged) users can view our home page. In other words, the slamming bots can be non-authenticated (and essentially non-trackable except by IP address).
So we're back to scanning for IPs, which a) is fairly useless in this age of cloud networking and spambot zombies and b) catches too many innocents given the number of businesses that come from one IP address (not to mention the issues with non-static IP ISPs and potential performance hits to trying to track this).
Oh, and having people call us would be the worst possible scenario. Can we have them call you?

BradC: Ned Batchelder's methods look pretty cool, but they're pretty firmly designed to defeat bots built for a network of sites. Our problem is bots are built specifically to defeat our site. Some of these methods could likely work for a short time until the scripters evolved their bots to ignore the honeypot, screen-scrape for nearby label names instead of form ids, and use a javascript-capable browser control.

 

lc again: ""Unless, of course, the hype is part of your marketing scheme."" Yes, it definitely is. The surprise of when the item appears, as well as the excitement if you manage to get one is probably as much or more important than the crap you actually end up getting. Anything that eliminates first-come/first-serve is detrimental to the thrill of 'winning' the crap.

 

novatrust: And I, for one, welcome our new bot overlords. We actually do offer RSSfeeds to allow 3rd party apps to scan our site for product info, but not ahead of the main site HTML. If I'm interpreting it right, your solution does help goal 2 (performance issues) by completely sacrificing goal 1, and just resigning the fact that bots will be buying most of the crap. I up-voted your response, because your last paragraph pessimism feels accurate to me. There seems to be no silver bullet here.

The rest of the responses generally rely on IP tracking, which, again, seems to both be useless (with botnets/zombies/cloud networking) and detrimental (catching many innocents who come from same-IP destinations).
Any other approaches / ideas? My developers keep saying ""let's just do CAPTCHA"" but I'm hoping there's less intrusive methods to all actual humans wanting some of our crap.
Original question
Say you're selling something cheap that has a very high perceived value, and you have a very limited amount. No one knows exactly when you will sell this item. And over a million people regularly come by to see what you're selling.
You end up with scripters and bots attempting to programmatically [a] figure out when you're selling said item, and [b] make sure they're among the first to buy it. This sucks for two reasons:

Your site is slammed by non-humans, slowing everything down for everyone.
The scripters end up 'winning' the product, causing the regulars to feel cheated.

A seemingly obvious solution is to create some hoops for your users to jump through before placing their order, but there are at least three problems with this:

The user experience sucks for humans, as they have to decipher CAPTCHA, pick out the cat, or solve a math problem.
If the perceived benefit is high enough, and the crowd large enough, some group will find their way around any tweak, leading to an arms race. (This is especially true the simpler the tweak is; hidden 'comments' form, re-arranging the form elements, mis-labeling them, hidden 'gotcha' text all will work once and then need to be changed to fight targeting this specific form.)
Even if the scripters can't 'solve' your tweak it doesn't prevent them from slamming your front page, and then sounding an alarm for the scripter to fill out the order, manually. Given they get the advantage from solving [a], they will likely still win [b] since they'll be the first humans reaching the order page. Additionally, 1. still happens, causing server errors and a decreased performance for everyone.

Another solution is to watch for IPs hitting too often, block them from the firewall, or otherwise prevent them from ordering. This could solve 2. and prevent [b] but the performance hit from scanning for IPs is massive and would likely cause more problems like 1. than the scripters were causing on their own. Additionally, the possibility of cloud networking and spambot zombies makes IP checking fairly useless.
A third idea, forcing the order form to be loaded for some time (say, half a second) would potentially slow the progress of the speedy orders, but again, the scripters would still be the first people in, at any speed not detrimental to actual users.
Goals

Sell the item to non-scripting humans.
Keep the site running at a speed not slowed by bots.
Don't hassle the 'normal' users with any tasks to complete to prove they're human.

4397,914939,"Simple tool to 'accept theirs' or 'accept mine' on a whole file using git

I don't want a visual merge tool, and I also don't want to have to vi the conflicted file and manually choose the between HEAD (mine) and the imported change (theirs).  Most of the time I either want all of their changes or all of mine.  Commonly this is because my change made it upsteam and is coming back to me through a pull, but may be slightly modified in various places.

Is there a command line tool which will get rid of the conflict markers and choose all one way or another based on my choice?  Or a set of git commands which I can alias myself to do each one.

# accept mine
alias am=""some_sequence;of;commands""
alias at=""some_other_sequence;of;commands""


Doing this is rather annoying.
For 'accept mine' I have tried: 

randy@sabotage ~/linus $ git merge test-branch
Auto-merging Makefile
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in Makefile
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

randy@sabotage ~/linus $ git checkout Makefile 
error: path 'Makefile' is unmerged

andy@sabotage ~/linus $ git reset --hard HEAD Makefile 
fatal: Cannot do hard reset with paths.


How am I supposed to get rid of these change markers?

I can do: 

git reset HEAD Makefile; rm Makefile; git checkout Makefile


But this seems rather round about, there must be a better way.  And at this point, I'm not sure if git even thinks the merge happened, so I don't think this necessarily even works.

Going the other way, doing 'accept theirs' is equally messy.
The only way I can figure it out is do:

git show test-branch:Makefile > Makefile; git add Makefile;


This also gives me a messed up commit message, which has Conflicts: Makefile in it twice.

Can someone please point out how to do the above two actions in a simpler way?  Thanks

4421,2196995,"Is there any advantage of using map over unordered_map in case of trivial keys?

A recent talk about unordered_map in C++ made me realize that I should use unordered_map for most cases where I used map before, because of the efficiency of lookup ( amortized O(1) vs. O(log n) ). Most times I use a map, I use either int or std::string as the key type; hence, I've got no problems with the definition of the hash function. The more I thought about it, the more I came to realize that I can't find any reason of using a std::map over a std::unordered_map in the case of keys with simple types -- I took a look at the interfaces, and didn't find any significant differences that would impact my code. 

Hence the question: is there any real reason to use std::map over std::unordered_map in the case of simple types like int and std::string?

I'm asking from a strictly programming point of view -- I know that it's not fully considered standard, and that it may pose problems with porting.

Also, I expect that one of the correct answers might be ""it's more efficient for smaller sets of data"" because of a smaller overhead (is that true?) -- hence I'd like to restrict the question to cases where the amount of keys is non-trivial (>1 024).

I have a Docker container that I've created simply by installing Docker on Ubuntu and doing:

exit

Then I wanted to add a volume and realised that this is not as straightforward as I thought it would be. If I use sudo docker -v /somedir run ... then I end up with a fresh new container, so I'd have to install Java and do what I've already done before just to arrive at a container with a mounted volume.
All the documentation about mounting a folder from the host seems to imply that mounting a volume is something that can be done when creating a container. So the only option I have to avoid reconfiguring a new container from scratch is to commit the existing container to a repository and use that as the basis of a new one whilst mounting the volume.

This might sound like too basic of a question, but I have searched for answers and I am more confused now than before.

What does ""ours"" and ""theirs"" mean in git when merging my branch into my other branch?
Both branches are ""ours"". 

In a merge conflict is ""ours"" always the upper of the two versions displayed? 

Does ""ours"" always refer to the branch that HEAD was pointing to when the merge began? If so then why not use a clear possessive reference like ""current branch's"" instead of using a possessive pronoun like ""ours"" that is referentially ambiguous (since both branches are technically ours)? 

Or just use the branch name (instead of saying ""ours"" just say ""local master's"" or such)?

The most confusing part to me is if I specify in a specific branch's .gitattributes file. Lets say in test branch I have the following .gitattributes file:

config.xml merge=ours


Now I checkout and point HEAD to master then merge in test. Since master is ours, and test's .gitattributes is not checked out, will it even have an effect? If it does have an effect, since master is now ""ours"", then what will happen?

4455,28969861,"Managing jQuery plugin dependency in webpack

I'm using Webpack in my application, in which I create two entry points - bundle.js for all my JavaScript files/codes, and vendors.js for all libraries like jQuery and React. What do I do in order to use plugins which have jQuery as their dependencies and I want to have them also in vendors.js? What if those plugins have multiple dependencies?

Currently I'm trying to use this jQuery plugin here - https://github.com/mbklein/jquery-elastic. The Webpack documentation mentions providePlugin and imports-loader. I used providePlugin, but still the jQuery object is not available. Here is how my webpack.config.js looks like-

var webpack = require('webpack');
var bower_dir = __dirname + '/bower_components';
var node_dir = __dirname + '/node_modules';
var lib_dir = __dirname + '/public/js/libs';

        this.module.noParse.push(new RegExp(path));
    },

            ""window.jQuery"": ""jquery""

    ],
    entry: {
        app: ['./public/js/main.js'],

    },
    resolve: {
        alias: {
            'jquery': node_dir + '/jquery/dist/jquery.js',
            'jquery.elastic': lib_dir + '/jquery.elastic.source.js'
        }
    },
    output: {
        path: './public/js',
        filename: 'bundle.js'
    },

};

config.addVendor('jquery', node_dir + '/jquery/dist/jquery.js');
config.addVendor('jquery.elastic', lib_dir +'/jquery.elastic.source.js');

module.exports = config;


But in spite of this, it still throws an error in the browser console:


  Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined


Similarly, when I use the imports-loader, it throws an error,


  require is not defined'


in this line:

var jQuery = require(""jquery"")


However, I could use the same plugin when I don't add it to my vendors.js file and instead required it in the normal AMD way as how I include my other JavaScript code files, like-

define(

    'react',
    '../../common-functions',
    '../../libs/jquery.elastic.source'
],function($,React,commonFunctions){
    $(""#myInput"").elastic() //It works

});


But this is not what I want to do, as this would mean that jquery.elastic.source.js is bundled along with my JavaScript code in bundle.js, and I want all my jQuery plugins to be in the vendors.js bundle. So how do I go about achieving this?

If you want a Cartesian product of the same list with itself multiple times, itertools.product can handle that elegantly. See Operation on every pair of element in a list or Generating permutations with repetitions.

4473,23542989,"Pointers vs. values in parameters and return values

In Go there are various ways to return a struct value or slice thereof. For individual ones I've seen:

type MyStruct struct {
    Val int
}

func myfunc() MyStruct {
    return MyStruct{Val: 1}
}

func myfunc() *MyStruct {
    return &MyStruct{}
}

func myfunc(s *MyStruct) {
    s.Val = 1
}


I understand the differences between these. The first returns a copy of the struct, the second a pointer to the struct value created within the function, the third expects an existing struct to be passed in and overrides the value.

I've seen all of these patterns be used in various contexts, I'm wondering what the best practices are regarding these. When would you use which? For instance, the first one could be ok for small structs (because the overhead is minimal), the second for bigger ones. And the third if you want to be extremely memory efficient, because you can easily reuse a single struct instance between calls. Are there any best practices for when to use which?

Similarly, the same question regarding slices:

func myfunc() []MyStruct {
    return []MyStruct{ MyStruct{Val: 1} }
}

func myfunc() []*MyStruct {
    return []MyStruct{ &MyStruct{Val: 1} }
}

func myfunc(s *[]MyStruct) {
    *s = []MyStruct{ MyStruct{Val: 1} }
}

func myfunc(s *[]*MyStruct) {
    *s = []MyStruct{ &MyStruct{Val: 1} }
}


Again: what are best practices here. I know slices are always pointers, so returning a pointer to a slice isn't useful. However, should I return a slice of struct values, a slice of pointers to structs, should I pass in a pointer to a slice as argument (a pattern used in the Go App Engine API)?

4480,7267102,"How do I update/upsert a document in Mongoose?

Perhaps it's the time, perhaps it's me drowning in sparse documentation and not being able to wrap my head around the concept of updating in Mongoose :)

Here's the deal: 

I have a contact schema and model (shortened properties):

var mongoose = require('mongoose'),
    Schema = mongoose.Schema;

var mongooseTypes = require(""mongoose-types""),
    useTimestamps = mongooseTypes.useTimestamps;


var ContactSchema = new Schema({
    phone: {
        type: String,
        index: {
            unique: true,
            dropDups: true
        }
    },
    status: {
        type: String,
        lowercase: true,
        trim: true,
        default: 'on'
    }
});
ContactSchema.plugin(useTimestamps);
var Contact = mongoose.model('Contact', ContactSchema);


I receive a request from the client, containing the fields I need and use my model thusly:

mongoose.connect(connectionString);
var contact = new Contact({
    phone: request.phone,
    status: request.status
});


And now we reach the problem:


If I call contact.save(function(err){...}) I'll receive an error if the contact with the same phone number already exists (as expected - unique)
I can't call update() on contact, since that method does not exist on a document
If I call update on the model:
Contact.update({phone:request.phone}, contact, {upsert: true}, function(err{...})
I get into an infinite loop of some sorts, since the Mongoose update implementation clearly doesn't want an object as the second parameter.
If I do the same, but in the second parameter I pass an associative array of the request properties {status: request.status, phone: request.phone ...} it works - but then I have no reference to the specific contact and cannot find out its createdAt and updatedAt properties.


So the bottom line, after all I tried: given a document contact, how do I update it if it exists, or add it if it doesn't?

4485,15381105,"What is the motivation behind the introduction of preflight CORS requests?

Cross-origin resource sharing is a mechanism that allows a web page to make XMLHttpRequests to another domain (from Wikipedia).
I've been fiddling with CORS for the last couple of days and I think I have a pretty good understanding of how everything works.
So my question is not about how CORS / preflight work, it's about the reason behind coming up with preflights as a new request type. I fail to see any reason why server A needs to send a preflight (PR) to server B just to find out if the real request (RR) will be accepted or not - it would certainly be possible for B to accept/reject RR without any prior PR.
After searching quite a bit I found this piece of information at www.w3.org (7.1.5):

To protect resources against cross-origin requests that could not originate from certain user agents before this specification existed a
preflight request is made to ensure that the resource is aware of this
specification.

I find this is the hardest to understand sentence ever. My interpretation (should better call it 'best guess') is that it's about protecting server B against requests from server C that is not aware of the spec.
Can someone please explain a scenario / show a problem that PR + RR solves better than RR alone?

Essentially, the changes to href='#topic' and href='' under the base tag are very incompatible with their default behavior, and this change from the default behavior could easily make third party libraries outside of your control very unreliable  in unexpected ways, since they will logically depend on the default behavior.  Often the changes are subtle and lead to not-immediately-obvious problems when dealing with a large codebase.  I have since created an answer detailing the issues that I experienced below.

"
4515,16286605,"AngularJS : Initialize service with asynchronous data

I have an AngularJS service that I want to initialize with some asynchronous data. Something like this:

myModule.service('MyService', function($http) {
    var myData = null;

    $http.get('data.json').success(function (data) {
        myData = data;
    });

    return {
        setData: function (data) {
            myData = data;
        },
        doStuff: function () {
            return myData.getSomeData();
        }
    };
});


Obviously this won't work because if something tries to call doStuff() before myData gets back I will get a null pointer exception. As far as I can tell from reading some of the other questions asked here and here I have a few options, but none of them seem very clean (perhaps I am missing something):

Setup Service with ""run""

When setting up my app do this:

myApp.run(function ($http, MyService) {
    $http.get('data.json').success(function (data) {
        MyService.setData(data);
    });
});


Then my service would look like this:

myModule.service('MyService', function() {
    var myData = null;
    return {
        setData: function (data) {
            myData = data;
        },
        doStuff: function () {
            return myData.getSomeData();
        }
    };
});


This works some of the time but if the asynchronous data happens to take longer than it takes for everything to get initialized I get a null pointer exception when I call doStuff()

Use promise objects

This would probably work. The only downside it everywhere I call MyService I will have to know that doStuff() returns a promise and all the code will have to us then to interact with the promise. I would rather just wait until myData is back before loading the my application.

Manual Bootstrap 

angular.element(document).ready(function() {
    $.getJSON(""data.json"", function (data) {
       // can't initialize the data here because the service doesn't exist yet
       angular.bootstrap(document);
       // too late to initialize here because something may have already
       // tried to call doStuff() and would have got a null pointer exception
    });
});


Global Javascript Var
I could send my JSON directly to a global Javascript variable:

HTML:

<script type=""text/javascript"" src=""data.js""></script>


data.js:

var dataForMyService = { 
// myData here
};


Then it would be available when initializing MyService:

myModule.service('MyService', function() {
    var myData = dataForMyService;
    return {
        doStuff: function () {
            return myData.getSomeData();
        }
    };
});


This would work too, but then I have a global javascript variable which smells bad.

Are these my only options? Are one of these options better than the others? I know this is a pretty long question, but I wanted to show that I have tried to explore all my options. Any guidance would greatly be appreciated.

I can appreciate that a greasemonkey script would want to bundle anything it can within the source as opposed to host it on a server, that's obvious enough. But since I had not seen this technique previously, I considered its use and it seems appealing for a number of reasons:


It will reduce the amount of HTTP requests on page load, thus enhancing performance
If no CDN, then it will reduce the amount of traffic generated through cookies being sent alongside of images
CSS files can be cached
CSS files can be GZIPPED 


Considering that IE6 (for instance) has problems with cache for background images, this seems like it's not the worst idea...

So, is this a good or bad practice, why WOULDN'T you use it and what tools would you use to base64 encode the images?

178.1Kb 
GZIP encoding server side

Nice, but it will be slightly less useful for smaller images, I guess.

4544,41509439,"What's the difference between ClusterIP, NodePort and LoadBalancer service types in Kubernetes?

Question 1 - I'm reading the documentation and I'm slightly confused with the wording. It says:

ClusterIP: Exposes the service on a cluster-internal IP. Choosing this value makes the service only reachable from within the cluster. This is the default ServiceType
NodePort: Exposes the service on each Node’s IP at a static port (the NodePort). A ClusterIP service, to which the NodePort service will route, is automatically created. You’ll be able to contact the NodePort service, from outside the cluster, by requesting <NodeIP>:<NodePort>.
LoadBalancer: Exposes the service externally using a cloud provider’s load balancer. NodePort and ClusterIP services, to which the external load balancer will route, are automatically created.

Does the NodePort service type still use the ClusterIP but just at a different port, which is open to external clients? So in this case is <NodeIP>:<NodePort> the same as <ClusterIP>:<NodePort>?
Or is the NodeIP actually the IP found when you run kubectl get nodes and not the virtual IP used for the ClusterIP service type?
Question 2 - Also in the diagram from the link below:

Is there any particular reason why the Client is inside the Node? I assumed it would need to be inside a Clusterin the case of a ClusterIP service type?
If the same diagram was drawn for NodePort, would it be valid to draw the client completely outside both the Node andCluster or am I completely missing the point?

4549,1606797,"Use of .apply() with 'new' operator. Is this possible?

In JavaScript, I want to create an object instance (via the new operator), but pass an arbitrary number of arguments to the constructor. Is this possible?

What I want to do is something like this (but the code below does not work):

function Something(){
    // init stuff
}
function createSomething(){
    return new Something.apply(null, arguments);
}
var s = createSomething(a,b,c); // 's' is an instance of Something




The Answer

From the responses here, it became clear that there's no built-in way to call .apply() with the new operator. However, people suggested a number of really interesting solutions to the problem.

My preferred solution was this one from Matthew Crumley (I've modified it to pass the arguments property):

var createSomething = (function() {
    function F(args) {
        return Something.apply(this, args);
    }
    F.prototype = Something.prototype;

    return function() {
        return new F(arguments);
    }
})();

4634,413807,"Is there a way for non-root processes to bind to ""privileged"" ports on Linux?

It's very annoying to have this limitation on my development box, when there won't ever be any users other than me.

I'm aware of the standard workarounds, but none of them do exactly what I want:


authbind (The version in Debian testing, 1.0, only supports IPv4)
Using the iptables REDIRECT target to redirect a low port to a high port (the ""nat"" table is not yet implemented for ip6tables, the IPv6 version of iptables)
sudo (Running as root is what I'm trying to avoid)
SELinux (or similar). (This is just my dev box, I don't want to introduce a lot of extra complexity.)


Is there some simple sysctl variable to allow non-root processes to bind to ""privileged"" ports (ports less than 1024) on Linux, or am I just out of luck?

4640,21163108,"Custom thread pool in Java 8 parallel stream

Is it possible to specify a custom thread pool for Java 8 parallel stream? I can not find it anywhere. 

Imagine that I have a server application and I would like to use parallel streams. But the application is large and multi-threaded so I want to compartmentalize it. I do not want a slow running task in one module of the applicationblock tasks from another module.

If I can not use different thread pools for different modules, it means I can not safely use parallel streams in most of real world situations.

Try the following example. There are some CPU intensive tasks executed in separate threads.
The tasks leverage parallel streams. The first task is broken, so each step takes 1 second (simulated by thread sleep). The issue is that other threads get stuck and wait for the broken task to finish. This is contrived example, but imagine a servlet app and someone submitting a long running task to the shared fork join pool.

4642,23935810,"Mipmap drawables for icons

Since Android 4.3 (Jelly Bean) we can now make use of the res/mipmap folders to store ""mipmap"" images.

For example, Chrome for Android stores its icons in these folders instead of the more normal res/drawable folders.

How are these mipmap images different from the other familiar drawable images?

I see that in my manifest, we use the @mipmap/ qualifier, instead of @drawable/, which makes sense given the resource folder name:

<activity
    android:name="".MipmapDemp""
    android:icon=""@mipmap/ic_launcher"" />




References:

The Android 4.3 APIs document has the following to say:


  Using a mipmap as the source for your bitmap or drawable is a simple
  way to provide a quality image and various image scales, which can be
  particularly useful if you expect your image to be scaled during an
  animation.
  
  Android 4.2 (API level 17) added support for mipmaps in the Bitmap
  class—Android swaps the mip images in your Bitmap when you've supplied
  a mipmap source and have enabled setHasMipMap(). Now in Android 4.3,
  you can enable mipmaps for a BitmapDrawable object as well, by
  providing a mipmap asset and setting the android:mipMap attribute in a
  bitmap resource file or by calling hasMipMap().


I don't see anything in there that helps me to understand.



XML Bitmap resources have an android:mipMap property:


  Boolean. Enables or disables the mipmap hint. See setHasMipMap() for
  more information. Default value is false.


This does not apply to launcher icons as far as I can see.



The question was raised on Google Groups (The purpose of resource name ""mipmap""?!), to which Romain Guy replied:


  It's useful to provide an image at a larger resolution that would
  normally be computed (for instance, on an mdpi device, Launcher might
  want the larger hdpi icon to display large app shortcuts.)


I feel like this almost makes sense of it, but not quite.

I'm still inclined to go with Randy Sugianto's follow up:


  What are the advantages of this? Is there any guide how to use
  mipmaps, probably for better launcher icons?




Of course, Wikipedia has a page for ""Mipmap"", which refers to an older technique invented in 1983, that I can't quite relate to the current Android implementation.



Should we be storing all our app icons in res/mipmap folders these days, and what are the guidelines for these mipmap images?



Update #1

Here's a blog post that tries to explain it a bit.


Mipmapping for drawables in Android 4.3


But the image used in that blog post shows what looks like one file with many logos in it. This is not what I see in Chrome's mipmap folder.

Chrome's mipmap-hdpi folder contains three images. One is the Chrome logo, on its own.



Strangely, it is 72x72, not 48x48 which I would expect to see.

Perhaps that is all there is to this - we just need to keep bigger icons in the mipmap folders?



Update #2

The Android Developers Blog post of 23/10/2014 again confirms the idea of using the mipmap folders for application icons:


Getting Your Apps Ready for Nexus 6 and Nexus 9


When talking about the Nexus 6 screen density, the author writes:


  It’s best practice to place your app icons in mipmap- folders (not the
  drawable- folders) because they are used at resolutions different from
  the device’s current density. For example, an xxxhdpi app icon can be
  used on the launcher for an xxhdpi device.




Update #3

Note that Android Studio creates the ic_launcher.png icons in the mipmap... folders rather than the drawable... folders that Eclipse used to create them in.

From MSDN:


  An

  expression, in the catch or finally block of an exception handling
  statement, in the block of a lock statement, or in an unsafe context.


I assume this is either difficult or impossible for the compiler team to implement for some reason.

I attempted a work around with the using statement:

class Async
{
    public static async Task<IDisposable> Lock(object obj)
    {
        while (!Monitor.TryEnter(obj))

{
    await SomethingAsync();

However this does not work as expected.  The call to Monitor.Exit within ExitDisposable.Dispose seems to block indefinitely (most of the time) causing deadlocks as other threads attempt to acquire the lock.  I suspect the unreliability of my work around and the reason await statements are not allowed in lock statement are somehow related.

Say you have a linked list structure in Java.  It's made up of Nodes:

class Node {
    Node next;

}


and each Node points to the next node, except for the last Node, which has null for next.  Say there is a possibility that the list can contain a loop - i.e. the final Node, instead of having a null, has a reference to one of the nodes in the list which came before it.

What's the best way of writing

boolean hasLoop(Node first)


which would return true if the given Node is the first of a list with a loop, and false otherwise?  How could you write so that it takes a constant amount of space and a reasonable amount of time?

Heroku has a policy of ignoring all branches but 'master'.

A test or QA team might manage such a repository to try out different candidate branches, but they would have to coordinate so that they all agree on what branch they are pushing to it on any given day.

Needless to say, it would also be a very good idea to have a separate remote repository (like GitHub) without this restriction for backing everything up to. I'd call that one ""origin"" and use ""heroku"" for Heroku so that ""git push"" always backs up everything to origin, and ""git push heroku"" pushes whatever branch I'm currently on to Heroku's master branch, overwriting it if necessary.

Would this work?


[remote ""heroku""]
    url = git@heroku.com:my-app.git
    push = +refs/heads/*:refs/heads/master


I'd like to hear from someone more experienced before I begin to experiment, although I suppose I could create a dummy app on Heroku and experiment with that.

As for fetching, I don't really care if the Heroku repository is write-only. I still have a separate repository, like GitHub, for backup and cloning of all my work.

Footnote: This question is similar to, but not quite the same as Good Git deployment using branches strategy with Heroku?

4710,3090369,"Disable validation of HTML form elements

In my forms, I'd like to use the new HTML form types, for example <input type=""url"" /> (more info about the types here).
The problem is that Chrome wants to be super helpful and validate these elements for me, except that it sucks at it. If it fails the built-in validation, there's no message or indication other than the element getting focus. I prefill URL elements with ""http://"", and so my own custom validation just treats those values as empty strings, however Chrome rejects that. If I could change its validation rules, that would work too.
I know I could just revert back to using type=""text"" but I want the nice enhancements using these new types offers (eg: it automatically switches to a custom keyboard layout on mobile devices):

Is there a way to switch off or customise the automatic validation?

4711,5508110,"Why is this program erroneously rejected by three C++ compilers?

I am having some difficulty compiling a C++ program that I've written.

This program is very simple and, to the best of my knowledge, conforms to all the rules set forth in the C++ Standard.  I've read over the entirety of ISO/IEC 14882:2003 twice to be sure.

The program is as follows:



Here is the output I received when trying to compile this program with Visual C++ 2010:

c:\dev>cl /nologo helloworld.png
cl : Command line warning D9024 : unrecognized source file type 'helloworld.png', object file assumed
helloworld.png : fatal error LNK1107: invalid or corrupt file: cannot read at 0x5172


Dismayed, I tried g++ 4.5.2, but it was equally unhelpful:

c:\dev>g++ helloworld.png
helloworld.png: file not recognized: File format not recognized
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status


I figured that Clang (version 3.0 trunk 127530) must work, since it is so highly praised for its standards conformance.  Unfortunately, it didn't even give me one of its pretty, highlighted error messages:

c:\dev>clang++ helloworld.png
helloworld.png: file not recognized: File format not recognized
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
clang++: error: linker (via gcc) command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)


To be honest, I don't really know what any of these error message mean.

Many other C++ programs have source files with a .cpp extension, so I thought perhaps I needed to rename my file.  I changed its name to helloworld.cpp, but that didn't help.  I think there is a very serious bug in Clang because when I tried using it to compile the renamed program, it flipped out, printed ""84 warnings and 20 errors generated."" and made my computer beep a lot!

What have I done wrong here?  Have I missed some critical part of the C++ Standard?  Or are all three compilers really just so broken that they can't compile this simple program?

else { <a class=""anon"">My link here</a> }

4758,26556436,"React ""after render"" code?

I have an app where I need to set the height of an element (lets say ""app-content"") dynamically. It takes the height of the ""chrome"" of the app and subtracts it and then sets the height of the ""app-content"" to fit 100% within those constraints. This is super simple with vanilla JS, jQuery, or Backbone views, but I'm struggling to figure out what the right process would be for doing this in React?

Below is an example component. I want to be able to set app-content's height to be 100% of the window minus the size of the ActionBar and BalanceBar, but how do I know when everything is rendered and where would I put the calculation stuff in this React Class?

/** @jsx React.DOM */

Calling MyAsyncMethod() without awaiting it causes a ""Because this call is not awaited, the current method continues to run before the call is completed"" warning in visual studio. On the page for that warning it states:

You should consider suppressing the warning only if you're sure that you don't want to wait for the asynchronous call to complete and that the called method won't raise any exceptions.

I'm sure I don't want to wait for the call to complete; I don't need to or have the time to. But the call might raise exceptions.
I've stumbled into this problem a few times and I'm sure it's a common problem which must have a common solution.
How do I safely call an async method without awaiting the result?
Update:
For people suggesting that I just await the result, this is code that is responding to a web request on our web service (ASP.NET Web API). Awaiting in a UI context keeps the UI thread free, but awaiting in a web request call will wait for the Task to finish before responding to the request, thereby increasing response times with no reason.

4783,1566595,"Can I use multiple versions of jQuery on the same page?

A project I'm working on requires the use of jQuery on customers' Web pages. Customers will insert a chunk of code that we'll supply which includes a few <script> elements that build a widget in a <script>-created <iframe>. If they aren't already using the latest version of jQuery, this will also include (most likely) a <script> for Google's hosted version of jQuery.

The problem is that some customers may already have an older version of jQuery installed. While this may work if it's at least a fairly recent version, our code does rely on some recently introduced functionality in the jQuery library, so there are bound to be instances when a customer's jQuery version is just too old. We can't require that they upgrade to the latest version of jQuery.

Is there any way to load a newer version of jQuery to use only within the context of our code, that will not interfere with, or affect, any code on the customer's page? Ideally, maybe we could check for the presence of jQuery, detect the version, and if it's too old, then somehow load the most recent version just to use for our code.

I had the idea of loading jQuery in an <iframe> in the customer's domain that also includes our <script>, which seems like it might be feasible, but I'm hoping there's a more elegant way to do it (not to mention without the performance and complexity penalties of extra <iframe>s).

4788,4485059,"Git Bash is extremely slow on Windows 7 x64

I've been using Git on both Windows and Ubuntu during the development of a small project, frequently flipping back and forth between the two. The issue is that Git Bash consistently becomes slow.

When I say slow, I mean that running cd takes anywhere from 8-25 seconds, running git commands take from 5-20 seconds, and ls can take up to 30 seconds sometimes. Needless to say, this is not fun, not to mention unproductive. I know Git is slower on Windows, but this is ridiculous.

The one solution which has worked--temporarily--for me has been to disable my network connection (as suggested in this answer), start Git Bash, and then reconnect. Sometimes it continues to run quickly for days after doing that, but the performance always degrades eventually. I've trawled through the msysgit discussion group, Stack Overflow, msysgit issue list, etc. on and off for weeks, but I haven't been able to turn up solutions which work.

So far, I've tried:


Adding Git & project folders to the virus scanner's exclusion list
Disabling my virus scanner completely (Kaspersky IS 2011)
Ensuring that Outlook is not running (Outlook 2007)
Shutting down all other applications
Running Git Bash as administrator
Disabling network connection, starting Git Bash, and keeping connection disabled
Disabling network connection, starting Git Bash, re-enabling connection (works only occasionally)
Running git gc
And combinations of the above


I did read that a couple of people had success disabling Bash completion, but ideally I'd like to keep that active. The version of msysgit is 1.7.3.1-preview20101002 & the OS is Windows 7 x64. Running the same things on Linux is, predictably, lightning fast. I would use Linux exclusively, but I need to run stuff in Windows, too (certain applications, testing, etc.).

Has anyone encountered a similar issue? If so, what was the underlying problem and what was the solution (if any)?

  Failure to comply could result in severe penalties.
  For further information, click here.
  Does your product contain encryption?


I use https://, but only via NSURLConnection and UIWebView.

The memset_16aligned function requires a 16-byte aligned pointer passed to it, or it will crash.
a) How would you allocate 1024 bytes of memory, and align it to a 16 byte boundary?
b) Free the memory after the memset_16aligned has executed.

{    
   void *mem;
   void *ptr;

   // answer a) here

   memset_16aligned(ptr, 0, 1024);

   // answer b) here

4841,366860,"When would you use the different git merge strategies?

From the man page on git-merge, there are a number of merge strategies you can use.  


resolve - 
This can only resolve two heads (i.e. the current branch and another branch you pulled from) using 3-way merge algorithm. It tries to carefully detect criss-cross merge ambiguities and is considered generally safe and fast.
recursive - 
This can only resolve two heads using 3-way merge algorithm. When there are more than one common ancestors that can be used for 3-way merge, it creates a merged tree of the common ancestors and uses that as the reference tree for the 3-way merge. This has been reported to result in fewer merge conflicts without causing mis-merges by tests done on actual merge commits taken from Linux 2.6 kernel development history. Additionally this can detect and handle merges involving renames. This is the default merge strategy when pulling or merging one branch.
octopus - 
This resolves more than two-head case, but refuses to do complex merge that needs manual resolution. It is primarily meant to be used for bundling topic branch heads together. This is the default merge strategy when pulling or merging more than one branches.
ours - 
This resolves any number of heads, but the result of the merge is always the current branch head. It is meant to be used to supersede old development history of side branches.
subtree - 
This is a modified recursive strategy. When merging trees A and B, if B corresponds to a subtree of A, B is first adjusted to match the tree structure of A, instead of reading the trees at the same level. This adjustment is also done to the common ancestor tree.


When should I specify something different than the default?  What scenarios are each best for?

4842,757684,"Enum ""Inheritance""

I have an enum in a low level namespace. I'd like to provide a class or enum in a mid level namespace that ""inherits"" the low level enum.

namespace low
{
   public enum base
   {
      x, y, z
   }
}

namespace mid
{
   public enum consume : low.base

I'm hoping that this is possible, or perhaps some kind of class that can take the place of the enum consume which will provide a layer of abstraction for the enum, but still let an instance of that class access the enum.

Thoughts?

EDIT:
One of the reasons I haven't just switched this to consts in classes is that the low level enum is needed by a service that I must consume. I have been given the WSDLs and the XSDs, which define the structure as an enum. The service cannot be changed.

The arguments object in JavaScript is an odd wart—it acts just like an array in most situations, but it's not actually an array object. Since it's really something else entirely, it doesn't have the useful functions from Array.prototype like forEach, sort, filter, and map.

function sortArgs() {

        args[i] = arguments[i];

4896,32369,"Disable browser 'Save Password' functionality

One of the joys of working for a government healthcare agency is having to deal with all of the paranoia around dealing with PHI (Protected Health Information). Don't get me wrong, I'm all for doing everything possible to protect people's personal information (health, financial, surfing habits, etc.), but sometimes people get a little too jumpy.

Case in point: One of our state customers recently found out that the browser provides the handy feature to save your password. We all know that it has been there for a while and is completely optional and is up to the end user to decide whether or not it is a smart decision to use or not. However, there is a bit of an uproar at the moment and we are being demanded to find a way to disable that functionality for our site.

Question: Is there a way for a site to tell the browser not to offer to remember passwords? I've been around web development a long time but don't know that I have come across that before.

Any help is appreciated.

4900,1062963,"How do browser cookie domains work?

Due to weird domain/subdomain cookie issues that I'm getting, I'd like to know how browsers handle cookies. If they do it in different ways, it would also be nice to know the differences.

In other words - when a browser receives a cookie, that cookie MAY have a domain and a path attached to it. Or not, in which case the browser probably substitutes some defaults for them. Question 1: what are they?

Later, when the browser is about to make a request, it checks its cookies and filters out the ones it should send for that request. It does so by matching them against the requests path and domain. Question 2: what are the matching rules?

Added:

The reason I'm asking this is because I'm interested in some edge cases. Like:


Will a cookie for .example.com be available for www.example.com?
Will a cookie for .example.com be available for example.com?
Will a cookie for example.com be available for www.example.com?
Will a cookie for example.com be available for anotherexample.com?
Will www.example.com be able to set cookie for example.com?
Will www.example.com be able to set cookie for www2.example.com?
Will www.example.com be able to set cookie for .com?
Etc.

Also, could someone suggest how I should set a cookie so that:


It can be set by either www.example.com or example.com;
It is accessible by both www.example.com and example.com.

4921,2224844,"How to get the absolute coordinates of a view

I'm trying to get the absolute screen pixel coordinates of the top left corner of a view. However, all methods I can find such as getLeft() and getRight() don't work as they all seem to be relative to the parent of the view, thus giving me 0. What is the proper way to do this?

If it helps, this is for a 'put the picture back in order' game. I want the user to be able to draw a box to select multiple pieces. My assumption is that the easiest way to do that is to getRawX() and getRawY() from the MotionEvent and then compare those values against the top left corner of the layout holding the pieces. Knowing the size of the pieces, I can then determine how many pieces have been selected. I realise I can use getX() and getY() on the MotionEvent, but as that returns a relative position that makes determining which pieces were selected more difficult. (Not impossible, I know, but it seems unnecessarily complicated).

Edit: This is the code I used to try to get the size of the holding container, as per one of the questions. TableLayout is the table which holds all the puzzle pieces.

TableLayout tableLayout = (TableLayout) findViewById(R.id.tableLayout);
Log.d(LOG_TAG, ""Values "" + tableLayout.getTop() + tableLayout.getLeft());


Edit 2: Here is the code I've tried, following more of the suggested answers.

public int[] tableLayoutCorners = new int[2];
(...)

TableLayout tableLayout = (TableLayout) findViewById(R.id.tableLayout);
tableLayout.requestLayout();
Rect corners = new Rect();
tableLayout.getLocalVisibleRect(corners);
Log.d(LOG_TAG, ""Top left "" + corners.top + "", "" + corners.left + "", "" + corners.right
            + "", "" + corners.bottom);

cells[4].getLocationOnScreen(tableLayoutCorners);
Log.d(LOG_TAG, ""Values "" + tableLayoutCorners[0] + "", "" + tableLayoutCorners[1]);


This code was added after all the initialisation is done. The image has been divided up into a array of ImageViews (the cells[] array) contained within a TableLayout. Cells[0] is the top left ImageView, and I picked cells[4] as it's somewhere in the middle and most definitely should not have coordinates of (0,0).

The code shown above still gives me all 0s in the logs, which I really don't understand because the various puzzle pieces are correctly displayed. (I tried public int for tableLayoutCorners and default visibility, both giving the same result.)

I don't know if this is significant, but the ImageViews are originally not given a size. The size of the ImageViews is determined during the initialisation automatically by the View when I give it an image to display. Could this contribute to their values being 0, even though that logging code is after they have been given an image and have automatically resized themselves? To potentially counter that, I added the code tableLayout.requestLayout() as shown above, but that didn't help.

Is there any way I can separate a List<SomeObject> into several separate lists of SomeObject, using the item index as the delimiter of each split?

Let me exemplify:

I have a List<SomeObject> and I need a List<List<SomeObject>> or List<SomeObject>[], so that each of these resulting lists will contain a group of 3 items of the original list (sequentially).

eg.:


Original List: [a, g, e, w, p, s, q, f, x, y, i, m, c]
Resulting lists: [a, g, e], [w, p, s], [q, f, x], [y, i, m], [c]


I'd also need the resulting lists size to be a parameter of this function.

I have a script named test1.py which is not in a module. It just has code that should execute when the script itself is run. There are no functions, classes, methods, etc. I have another script which runs as a service. I want to call test1.py from the script running as a service.

4968,7058339,"When to use references vs. pointers

I understand the syntax and general semantics of pointers versus references, but how should I decide when it is more-or-less appropriate to use references or pointers in an API?

Naturally some situations need one or the other (operator++ needs a reference argument), but in general I'm finding I prefer to use pointers (and const pointers) as the syntax is clear that the variables are being passed destructively.

E.g. in the following code:

void add_one(int& n) { n += 1; }
void add_one(int* const n) { *n += 1; }
int main() {
  int a = 0;
  add_one(a); // Not clear that a may be modified
  add_one(&a); // 'a' is clearly being passed destructively
}


With the pointer, it's always (more) obvious what's going on, so for APIs and the like where clarity is a big concern are pointers not more appropriate than references? Does that mean references should only be used when necessary (e.g. operator++)? Are there any performance concerns with one or the other?

EDIT (OUTDATED):

Besides allowing NULL values and dealing with raw arrays, it seems the choice comes down to personal preference. I've accepted the answer below that references Google's C++ Style Guide, as they present the view that ""References can be confusing, as they have value syntax but pointer semantics."".

Due to the additional work required to sanitise pointer arguments that should not be NULL (e.g. add_one(0) will call the pointer version and break during runtime), it makes sense from a maintainability perspective to use references where an object MUST be present, though it is a shame to lose the syntactic clarity.

4970,16392260,"Which websocket library to use with Node.js?

Currently there is a plethora of websocket libraries for node.js, the most popular seem to be:


https://github.com/Worlize/WebSocket-Node
https://github.com/einaros/ws
https://github.com/LearnBoost/engine.io
https://github.com/learnboost/socket.io
https://github.com/sockjs


However I can't find any solid concrete comparisons between any of them...
Apparently Socket.io was awesome, but has become quite dated and has failing builds. Both ws and websocket-node claim they are the fastest. And engine.io seems new, but a lot heavier than the lighter aletarntives.

It would be amazing if we or someone could put together an answer that serves as a guide on which socket library to use and when, as well as a comparison between them.

4973,40465047,"How can I mock an ES6 module import using Jest?

I want to test that one of my ES6 modules calls another ES6 module in a particular way. With Jasmine this is super easy --
The application code:
// myModule.js
import dependency from './dependency';

export default (x) => {
  dependency.doSomething(x * 2);
}

And the test code:
//myModule-test.js
import myModule from '../myModule';
import dependency from '../dependency';

describe('myModule', () => {
  it('calls the dependency with double the input', () => {
    spyOn(dependency, 'doSomething');

    myModule(2);

    expect(dependency.doSomething).toHaveBeenCalledWith(4);
  });
});

What's the equivalent with Jest? I feel like this is such a simple thing to want to do, but I've been tearing my hair out trying to figure it out.
The closest I've come is by replacing the imports with requires, and moving them inside the tests/functions. Neither of which are things I want to do.
// myModule.js
export default (x) => {
  const dependency = require('./dependency'); // Yuck
  dependency.doSomething(x * 2);
}

//myModule-test.js
describe('myModule', () => {
  it('calls the dependency with double the input', () => {
    jest.mock('../dependency');

    myModule(2);

    const dependency = require('../dependency'); // Also yuck
    expect(dependency.doSomething).toBeCalledWith(4);
  });
});

For bonus points, I'd love to make the whole thing work when the function inside dependency.js is a default export. However, I know that spying on default exports doesn't work in Jasmine (or at least I could never get it to work), so I'm not holding out hope that it's possible in Jest either.

"
4978,499126,"jQuery Set Cursor Position in Text Area

How do you set the cursor position in a text field using jQuery?  I've got a text field with content, and I want the users cursor to be positioned at a certain offset when they focus on the field.  The code should look kind of like this:

$('#input').focus(function() {
  $(this).setCursorPosition(4);
});


What would the implementation of that setCursorPosition function look like?  If you had a text field with the content abcdefg, this call would result in the cursor being positioned as follows: abcd**|**efg.

Java has a similar function, setCaretPosition.  Does a similar method exist for javascript?

Update: I modified CMS's code to work with jQuery as follows:

new function($) {
  $.fn.setCursorPosition = function(pos) {
    if (this.setSelectionRange) {
      this.setSelectionRange(pos, pos);
    } else if (this.createTextRange) {

4983,4153517,"How exactly does the android:onClick XML attribute differ from setOnClickListener?

From that I've read you can assign a onClick handler to a button in two ways.

Using the android:onClick XML attribute where you just use the name of a public method with the signaturevoid name(View v) or by using the setOnClickListener method where you pass an object that implement the OnClickListener interface. The latter often requires an anonymous class which personally I don't like (personal taste) or defining an internal class that implements the OnClickListener.

By using the XML attribute you just need to define a method instead of a class so I was
wondering if the same can be done via code and not in the XML layout.
