What is the difference between __str__ and __repr__ in Python?
"	1436703	"In Python, __str__ and __repr__ are both dunder methods used to define human-readable and unambiguous string representations of an object, respectively.

__str__ is meant to return a string that provides a concise, user-friendly representation of an object. The output of __str__ is usually intended for display to end-users, while still being informative enough to give an idea of what the object represents.

__repr__, on the other hand, is intended to provide a unambiguous, complete representation of an object. This representation should be formatted as a string and should ideally be usable as code to recreate the object if passed to eval(). The output of __repr__ is intended for debugging and development purposes.

"Comparing Java enum members: == or equals()?

"C++11 introduced a standardized memory model. What does it mean? And how is it going to affect C++ programming?
C++11 introduced a standardized memory model, but what exactly does that mean? And how is it going to affect C++ programming?
This article (by Gavin Clarke who quotes Herb Sutter) says that,
The memory model means that C++ code
now has a standardized library to call
regardless of who made the compiler
and on what platform it's running.
There's a standard way to control how
different threads talk to the
processor's memory.
""When you are talking about splitting
[code] across different cores that's
in the standard, we are talking about
the memory model. We are going to
optimize it without breaking the
following assumptions people are going
to make in the code,"" Sutter said.
Well, I can memorize this and similar paragraphs available online (as I've had my own memory model since birth :P) and can even post as an answer to questions asked by others, but to be honest, I don't exactly understand this.
C++ programmers used to develop multi-threaded applications even before, so how does it matter if it's POSIX threads, or Windows threads, or C++11 threads? What are the benefits? I want to understand the low-level details.
I also get this feeling that the C++11 memory model is somehow related to C++11 multi-threading support, as I often see these two together. If it is, how exactly? Why should they be related?
I don't know how the internals of multi-threading work, and what memory model means in general.
"	6319146	"The C++11 Standardized Memory Model specifies the rules for accessing and modifying the shared data in concurrent programs. It defines how the different threads in a program interact with memory and the order in which memory accesses by different threads should become visible to each other. This is important for ensuring the consistency and predictability of program behavior in multithreaded environments.

The introduction of the standardized memory model in C++11 will affect C++ programming by providing a clear and well-defined framework for writing concurrent programs in C++. This will lead to more consistent and predictable behavior across different platforms and make it easier to write programs that can take advantage of multiple cores and processors. Additionally, it will make it easier to write concurrent code that is portable across different systems and platforms."	eu.5cb84d29-f2e4-4dfc-93b2-88dd0e33994a				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de3970bf8cf9761109d9b2	00023da2e8--63de236e2ff0b42c197a2ed4	00023da2e8--63de3970bf8cf9761109d9b2	e94a0e4a9bc57c10ae8b01b0d910b306	APPROVED	2023-02-04T10:54:40.741	+

How do I convert a string to a byte[] in .NET (C#) without manually specifying a specific encoding?
I'm going to encrypt the string. I can encrypt it without converting, but I'd still like to know why encoding comes to play here.
Also, why should encoding even be taken into consideration? Can't I simply get what bytes the string has been stored in? Why is there a dependency on character encodings?
"	472906	"In .NET, strings are encoded as UTF-16, which means each character in a string is represented by two bytes. When you convert a string to a byte array, you need to specify an encoding to determine how the string should be translated into a byte representation. The choice of encoding can affect the resulting byte array, because different encodings may map the same string to different sequences of bytes.

For example, if you convert a string to a byte array using the UTF-8 encoding, the resulting byte array will be different than if you use the UTF-16 encoding.

When encrypting a string, you should use a consistent encoding to ensure that the same string is always translated to the same sequence of bytes, so that you can properly encrypt and decrypt it. If you don't specify an encoding, .NET will use the default encoding for your system, which may not be what you expect.

It's not possible to simply get the bytes that the string has been stored in, because a string is a higher-level object that is abstracted from the underlying representation of its characters in memory. To convert a string to a byte array, you need to translate the string into a specific representation, such as UTF-8 or UTF-16, using an encoding."	eu.0e05b549-ae86-4ec8-a45b-d2456654c867				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de3a086adb8b18a528516b	00023da2e8--63de236c2ff0b42c197a2dc8	00023da2e8--63de3a086adb8b18a528516b	3588b7726e48388a2b8a3e76f71466fc	APPROVED	2023-02-04T10:57:12.371	+

"What is the optimal algorithm for the game 2048?
I have recently stumbled upon the game 2048. You merge similar tiles by moving them in any of the four directions to make ""bigger"" tiles. After each move, a new tile appears at random empty position with a value of either 2 or 4. The game terminates when all the boxes are filled and there are no moves that can merge tiles, or you create a tile with a value of 2048.
One, I need to follow a well-defined strategy to reach the goal. So, I thought of writing a program for it.
My current algorithm:
while (!game_over) {
    for each possible move:
        count_no_of_merges_for_2-tiles and 4-tiles
    choose the move with a large number of merges
}
What I am doing is at any point, I will try to merge the tiles with values 2 and 4, that is, I try to have 2 and 4 tiles, as minimum as possible. If I try it this way, all other tiles were automatically getting merged and the strategy seems good.
But, when I actually use this algorithm, I only get around 4000 points before the game terminates. Maximum points AFAIK is slightly more than 20,000 points which is way larger than my current score. Is there a better algorithm than the above?
"	22342854	"Your current algorithm is a basic greedy approach, which only focuses on merging 2 and 4 tiles, but it doesn't consider other factors such as tile placement and maximizing the number of empty tiles.

A better approach is to use a Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. The algorithm simulates all possible moves and evaluates the best move by assigning scores to each possible game state. The score is calculated based on several factors such as tile placement, number of empty tiles, and the sum of tile values.

There are also more sophisticated algorithms such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), which can be used to find the optimal strategy. MCTS is a powerful algorithm that has been used to solve complex games such as chess and Go. However, it can be computationally intensive, so you may need to implement it carefully to ensure it runs efficiently for 2048."	eu.36c9c2eb-7eaf-4f08-8f89-acb6adccbb93				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de3caa8820411c59c712d5	00023da2e8--63de236f2ff0b42c197a2f55	00023da2e8--63de3caa8820411c59c712d5	eecfce578ec8f52e1db33743c0b80f7f	APPROVED	2023-02-04T11:08:26.922	+

"Difference between decimal, float and double in .NET?
What is the difference between decimal, float and double in .NET?
When would someone use one of these?
"	618535	"In .NET, decimal, float, and double are data types used to represent numeric values with varying levels of precision and range.

decimal: It is a high-precision floating-point data type with 28-29 significant digits of precision. It is used when precision is required, such as in financial calculations.

float: It is a single-precision floating-point data type with 7 significant digits of precision. It has a smaller range and precision than decimal but is faster for floating-point operations.

double: It is a double-precision floating-point data type with 15-16 significant digits of precision. It has a larger range and precision than float but is slower for floating-point operations.

In general, you would choose decimal for financial calculations that require high precision, float for single-precision floating-point operations, and double for double-precision floating-point operations"	eu.6e59e776-f604-40fd-97e8-2f92f3f4d388				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de3df7d7780d1c2015e2f9	00023da2e8--63de236b2ff0b42c197a2dae	00023da2e8--63de3df7d7780d1c2015e2f9	3588b7726e48388a2b8a3e76f71466fc	APPROVED	2023-02-04T11:13:59.931	+

"How to decide when to use Node.js?
I am new to this kind of stuff, but lately I've been hearing a lot about how good Node.js is. Considering how much I love working with jQuery and JavaScript in general, I can't help but wonder how to decide when to use Node.js. The web application I have in mind is something like Bitly - takes some content, archives it. 
From all the homework I have been doing in the last few days, I obtained the following information. Node.js 
is a command-line tool that can be run as a regular web server and lets one run JavaScript programs
utilizes the great V8 JavaScript engine
is very good when you need to do several things at the same time
is event-based so all the wonderful Ajax-like stuff can be done on the server side
lets us share code between the browser and the backend
lets us talk with MySQL
Some of the sources that I have come across are:
Diving into Node.js – Introduction and Installation
Understanding NodeJS
Node by Example (Archive.is)
Let’s Make a Web App: NodePad
Considering that Node.js can be run almost out-of-the-box on Amazon's EC2 instances, I am trying to understand what type of problems require Node.js as opposed to any of the mighty kings out there like PHP, Python and Ruby. I understand that it really depends on the expertise one has on a language, but my question falls more into the general category of: When to use a particular framework and what type of problems is it particularly suited for?

Web applications with real-time updates (e.g. chat applications)
Streaming data-intensive services (e.g. video and audio streaming)
RESTful APIs
Command-line tools and utilities
It's important to note that Node.js is not the best choice for every type of application. For example, it may not be the best choice for CPU-intensive applications or applications with complex server-side logic. In general, it's best to use Node.js when you need a fast and efficient solution for building network applications, and when you are comfortable with JavaScript."	eu.74fb3e20-d8fd-46b6-8934-fc09918cdfe8				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de3e08aff36b55e4ce1e20	00023da2e8--63de236d2ff0b42c197a2e83	00023da2e8--63de3e08aff36b55e4ce1e20	420edf6930f74d245330296489f788e8	APPROVED	2023-02-04T11:14:16.317	+

"Java inner class and static nested class
What is the main difference between an inner class and a static nested class in Java? Does design / implementation play a role in choosing one of these?
"	70324	"In Java, the main difference between an inner class and a static nested class is the way they are associated with the enclosing class.

An inner class is a non-static nested class that has access to the instance variables and methods of its enclosing class. It can be declared within the body of the enclosing class and is often used as a way to logically group classes that are only used in the context of the enclosing class.

A static nested class is a nested class that is declared with the static keyword. Unlike an inner class, it does not have access to the instance variables and methods of its enclosing class. It can be used as a regular class and is often used as a way to logically group related classes.

Design and implementation do play a role in choosing between an inner class and a static nested class. The choice between the two often depends on how tightly the class is coupled to the enclosing class. If the class is tightly coupled and needs access to the instance variables and methods of the enclosing class, an inner class may be the best choice. If the class is more loosely coupled and does not need access to the enclosing class, a static nested class may be a better choice."	eu.9ae13070-6e40-4266-b4b7-8f1b1c12c1a2				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de3e50c819b6546da843c0	00023da2e8--63de23702ff0b42c197a2f8e	00023da2e8--63de3e50c819b6546da843c0	420edf6930f74d245330296489f788e8	APPROVED	2023-02-04T11:15:28.439	+

Given that indexing is so important as your data set increases in size, can someone explain how indexing works at a database-agnostic level?
For information on queries to index a field, check out How do I index a database column.
"	1108	"Indexing in databases is a technique that allows for faster data retrieval operations on a database table by creating a separate data structure (the index) that stores a mapping of values in the indexed columns to their corresponding rows in the table. When a query is executed, the database first looks in the index rather than scanning the entire table, reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed.

The basic idea behind indexing is to provide a search tree-like data structure that allows for efficient searching of the data. The most common index structure used in databases is the B-Tree, which provides logarithmic time complexity for most operations. Other index structures such as Hash Tables or Tries can also be used depending on the use case.

When a new record is inserted or an existing record is updated, the index must also be updated to reflect the changes in the underlying data. The cost of maintaining the index needs to be balanced against the benefits of faster query performance.

In summary, indexing in databases is a technique used to increase the performance of data retrieval operations by creating a separate data structure that maps values in the indexed columns to their corresponding rows in the table. This allows the database to search the data more efficiently, reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed."	eu.24388116-fc27-4ced-b52e-28ea0a03624d				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de3f1a2ff0b42c197fddd4	00023da2e8--63de23682ff0b42c197a2c22	00023da2e8--63de3f1a2ff0b42c197fddd4	420edf6930f74d245330296489f788e8	APPROVED	2023-02-04T11:18:50.886	+

How would I validate that a program exists, in a way that will either return an error and exit, or continue with the script?
It seems like it should be easy, but it's been stumping me.

"How to lazy load images in ListView in Android
I am using a ListView to display some images and captions associated with those images. I am getting the images from the Internet. Is there a way to lazy load images so while the text displays, the UI is not blocked and images are displayed as they are downloaded?

    Add Picasso to your gradle dependencies:

python

implementation 'com.squareup.picasso:picasso:2.71828'

    In your custom adapter class, load images using Picasso in the getView method:

java

@Override
public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) {
    // Your existing code to inflate the view and set the text

    Picasso.get().load(""http://i.imgur.com/DvpvklR.png"").into(imageView);

}

"	588866	"In Objective-C, ""atomic"" and ""nonatomic"" are used as attributes in the property declarations of a class to control the behavior of the generated accessor methods for the property.

""atomic"" properties guarantee that access to the property value is thread-safe and will not result in data corruption by ensuring that access to the property value is done in a way that prevents multiple threads from simultaneously reading or writing to it.
""nonatomic"" properties, on the other hand, do not make any guarantees about thread safety, and multiple threads may access the property value simultaneously, potentially resulting in data corruption.
When ""atomic"" is not specified, the default behavior is ""atomic"".

So, in your examples:

""@property(nonatomic, retain) UITextField *userName;"" creates a ""nonatomic"" property.

"How do I profile C++ code running on Linux?
How do I find areas of my code that run slowly in a C++ application running on Linux?
"	375913	"There are several tools that can help you profile C++ code running on Linux:

    gprof: A standard Unix tool for profiling code that reports function-level information about how much time was spent in each function and how many times it was called.

    perf: A Linux performance analysis tool that provides performance metrics for hardware events such as CPU cycles and cache misses, as well as software events such as context switches and page faults.

    Valgrind: A dynamic analysis tool that can be used to find memory leaks, invalid memory accesses, and other problems in C++ programs.

    Callgrind: A tool that is part of the Valgrind suite that provides function-level information about how many times each function was called, how much time was spent in each function, and how many cache misses were incurred.

    gdb: A debugger that can be used to monitor the execution of a program and to identify the source of performance problems.

    Visual Studio Code: A popular open-source code editor that has a C++ profiling tool.

You can use these tools to identify performance bottlenecks in your code, such as functions that are taking too much time to execute, or areas of the code where you are using too much memory."	eu.9082f29a-f337-417c-befb-d670cd20039c				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de41dac934756c0b06c42b	00023da2e8--63de236e2ff0b42c197a2f1e	00023da2e8--63de41dac934756c0b06c42b	eecfce578ec8f52e1db33743c0b80f7f	APPROVED	2023-02-04T11:30:34.054	+

Remove duplicate values from JS array
Similar question:
Get all non-unique values (i.e.: duplicate/more than one occurrence) in an array
"	1960473	"The code you have posted uses an object-based approach to remove duplicates from an array. This approach works by adding each element in the array as a property of an object, which can only have unique properties. However, when an element is 0, this approach will not work as expected.

The reason is that when you add a property with a value of 0 to an object, it will be converted to a string and become ""0"", which is different from the original number 0. Therefore, when the second loop iterates over the properties of the object, it will include ""0"" in the result array, instead of 0.

To fix this, you can use the following code:

css

Array.prototype.getUnique = function() {
  var o = {}, a = [], i, e;
  for (i = 0; e = this[i]; i++) {
    o[e] = 1;
  }
  for (e in o) {
    a.push(+e);
  }
  return a;
};

Here, we use the unary plus operator (+) to convert the property back to a number before pushing it into the result array.

"Why is char[] preferred over String for passwords?
In Swing, the password field has a getPassword() (returns char[]) method instead of the usual getText() (returns String) method. Similarly, I have come across a suggestion not to use String to handle passwords.
Why does String pose a threat to security when it comes to passwords?
It feels inconvenient to use char[].
"	8881291	"Strings are immutable in Java and once created, they cannot be changed. This means that when you perform operations on a String, it creates a new String object in memory, while the original one remains unchanged. If a password is stored in a String, it remains in memory until garbage collection reclaims the memory. This increases the risk of the password being exposed, as it can be accessed by an attacker who gains access to the memory dump.

On the other hand, char arrays can be easily wiped out of memory after use, which makes them a safer option for storing passwords. The getPassword() method returns a char array, allowing the password to be cleared from memory after use, reducing the risk of exposure.

While using char[] might feel inconvenient, it is a recommended security measure to protect sensitive information like passwords."	eu.c44c3cb5-914b-4593-bc3a-8c22925e9d38				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de4448dc927a3420c9cbb2	00023da2e8--63de23642ff0b42c197a2a7a	00023da2e8--63de4448dc927a3420c9cbb2	420edf6930f74d245330296489f788e8	APPROVED	2023-02-04T11:40:56.908	+

Failing to use the global keyword where appropriate often causes UnboundLocalError. The precise rules for this are explained at UnboundLocalError on local variable when reassigned after first use. Generally, please close other questions as a duplicate of that question when an explanation is sought, and this question when someone simply needs to know the global keyword.
"	423379	"To use a global variable inside a function, you need to use the ""global"" keyword before the variable. This tells Python that the variable is a global variable and can be used across different functions. Here's an example:

x = 10

def my_function():
    global x
    x += 1
    print(x)

# Call the function
my_function() # Output: 11

# The global variable has been changed by the function
print(x) # Output: 11

To use a global variable that was defined in one function inside other functions, you need to use the ""global"" keyword in each function that wants to access the global variable:

python

# Define a global variable
x = 10

def first_function():
    global x
    x += 1

def second_function():

How does data binding work in the AngularJS framework?
I haven't found technical details on their site. It's more or less clear how it works when data is propagated from view to model. But how does AngularJS track changes of model properties without setters and getters?
I found that there are JavaScript watchers that may do this work. But they are not supported in Internet Explorer 6 and Internet Explorer 7. So how does AngularJS know that I changed for example the following and reflected this change on a view?
myobject.myproperty=""new value"";
"	9682092	"In AngularJS, data binding is achieved through a combination of dirty checking and digest cycles. When a model property is changed, AngularJS adds the property to a ""dirty"" checking list and runs a digest cycle to see if any changes have been made. The digest cycle runs until all model properties have stabilized and there are no more changes to be made. This process is repeated continuously to ensure that the view and model are always in sync.

AngularJS uses JavaScript getters and setters to track changes to model properties. In modern browsers, these getters and setters are automatically generated for object properties, but in older browsers such as Internet Explorer 6 and 7, AngularJS uses a fallback method based on AngularJS' own implementation of getters and setters, known as ""accessors."" These accessors are not subject to the same limitations as the native getters and setters, and thus AngularJS can continue to track changes to model properties even in older browsers."	eu.cd10a28c-a5dc-43d3-8fdf-99f64087efb9				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de4496405a38476b4dc3f7	00023da2e8--63de23702ff0b42c197a2f8c	00023da2e8--63de4496405a38476b4dc3f7	e94a0e4a9bc57c10ae8b01b0d910b306	APPROVED	2023-02-04T11:42:14.213	+

"How do CSS triangles work?
There're plenty of different CSS shapes over at CSS Tricks - Shapes of CSS and I'm particularly puzzled with a triangle:
#triangle-up {
  width: 0;
  height: 0;
  border-left: 50px solid transparent;
  border-right: 50px solid transparent;
  border-bottom: 100px solid red;

How and why does it work?
"	7073484	"CSS triangles work by setting the width and height of an element to 0 and creating transparent borders along two sides, while the third side is given a solid color border. This creates an illusion of a triangle by revealing only the color of the third border, and hiding the other two sides.

In the example, the triangle is facing upwards and has a width of 100px (the sum of the two 50px wide transparent borders), a height of 100px (the height of the red border), and is colored red. The border-bottom property creates the solid red border, while the border-left and border-right properties create the transparent borders."	eu.45ffb932-334f-4cb7-8551-245d055f477d				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de45108820411c59c82f69	00023da2e8--63de23702ff0b42c197a2fc3	00023da2e8--63de45108820411c59c82f69	69ac9e9ef4bf0b8c8b083d7e212aa393	APPROVED	2023-02-04T11:44:16.448	+

"Detecting an ""invalid date"" Date instance in JavaScript
I'd like to tell the difference between valid and invalid date objects in JS, but couldn't figure out how:
var d = new Date(""foo"");
console.log(d.toString()); // shows 'Invalid Date'
console.log(typeof d); // shows 'object'
console.log(d instanceof Date); // shows 'true'
Any ideas for writing an isValidDate function?
Ash recommended Date.parse for parsing date strings, which gives an authoritative way to check if the date string is valid.
What I would prefer, if possible, is have my API accept a Date instance and to be able to check/assert whether it's valid or not. Borgar's solution does that, but I need to test it across browsers. I also wonder whether there's a more elegant way.
Ash made me consider not having my API accept Date instances at all, this would be easiest to validate.
Borgar suggested testing for a Date instance, and then testing for the Date's time value. If the date is invalid, the time value is NaN. I checked with ECMA-262 and this behavior is in the standard, which is exactly what I'm looking for.
"	1353684	"The most elegant way to check if a Date object is valid in JavaScript is by checking its time value, which is represented as a numeric value. An invalid date object in JavaScript has a time value of NaN (Not-A-Number).

"Why can templates only be implemented in the header file?
Quote from The C++ standard library: a tutorial and handbook:
  The only portable way of using templates at the moment is to implement them in header files by using inline functions.
Why is this?
(Clarification: header files are not the only portable solution. But they are the most convenient portable solution.)
"	495021	The reason templates are typically implemented in header files is because they are compiled as part of the program that uses them, not as a separate object file like normal functions. The implementation of the template must be visible to the compiler at the point of instantiation, which occurs in the source file that uses the template. By including the implementation in a header file and including the header file in the source file, the compiler has access to the implementation at the point of instantiation. This makes it possible to instantiate the template for different types, generating different versions of the same code.	eu.088cd3ee-5070-45c7-823e-3dfc110e93bb				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de45c1461aef4decd4fbfa	00023da2e8--63de236d2ff0b42c197a2e9a	00023da2e8--63de45c1461aef4decd4fbfa	e94a0e4a9bc57c10ae8b01b0d910b306	APPROVED	2023-02-04T11:47:13.508	+

"Showing which files have changed between two revisions
I want to merge two branches that have been separated for a while and wanted to know which files have been modified.
Came across this link: http://linux.yyz.us/git-howto.html (moved to web.archive.org) which was quite useful.
The tools to compare branches I've come across are:
git diff master..branch
git log master..branch
git shortlog master..branch
Was wondering if there's something like ""git status master..branch"" to only see those files that are different between the two branches.
Without creating a new tool, I think this is the closest you can get to do that now (which of course will show repeats if a file was modified more than once):
git diff master..branch | grep ""^diff""
Was wondering if there's something I missed...
"	822811	"You can use git diff to compare two branches and show which files have changed between them. The command you mentioned, git diff master..branch, will display a detailed comparison of the changes made in each file between the two branches.

And then make changes to the new object that are not reflected in the original object.

How can I clone or deep copy an object so that the cloned object can be modified without any changes being reflected in the original object?
"	78536	"To deep clone an object in C#, you can use the System.Object.MemberwiseClone() method, which creates a shallow copy of the object. However, this method only creates a shallow copy, meaning that any reference type fields will still refer to the same object instances as the original object.

To create a true deep copy, you can implement a custom deep clone method by manually copying each field, including reference type fields, to a new object. Alternatively, you can use a serialization technique, such as BinaryFormatter or JsonSerializer, to serialize the original object to a memory stream, and then deserialize the memory stream to a new object, effectively creating a deep copy.

"Why is ""1000000000000000 in range(1000000000000001)"" so fast in Python 3?
It is my understanding that the range() function, which is actually an object type in Python 3, generates its contents on the fly, similar to a generator.
This being the case, I would have expected the following line to take an inordinate amount of time because, in order to determine whether 1 quadrillion is in the range, a quadrillion values would have to be generated:
1_000_000_000_000_000 in range(1_000_000_000_000_001)
Furthermore: it seems that no matter how many zeroes I add on, the calculation more or less takes the same amount of time (basically instantaneous).
I have also tried things like this, but the calculation is still almost instant:
# count by tens
1_000_000_000_000_000_000_000 in range(0,1_000_000_000_000_000_000_001,10)
If I try to implement my own range function, the result is not so nice!
def my_crappy_range(N):
    i = 0
    while i < N:
        yield i
        i += 1
    return
What is the range() object doing under the hood that makes it so fast?
Martijn Pieters's answer was chosen for its completeness, but also see abarnert's first answer for a good discussion of what it means for range to be a full-fledged sequence in Python 3, and some information/warning regarding potential inconsistency for __contains__ function optimization across Python implementations. abarnert's other answer goes into some more detail and provides links for those interested in the history behind the optimization in Python 3 (and lack of optimization of xrange in Python 2). Answers by poke and by wim provide the relevant C source code and explanations for those who are interested.
"	30081275	"In Python 3, the range function is optimized and implemented as an object of range type, which is a full-fledged sequence that implements an efficient __contains__ method. This method uses a binary search algorithm to check if a value is in the range, making it much faster than generating all the values in the range and checking one by one. The optimization makes the in operator with a range object very fast, even for large ranges. The behavior of the range object in Python 3 is not consistent across Python implementations, and the optimization may not be present in all implementations.

"What is JSONP, and why was it created?
I understand JSON, but not JSONP. Wikipedia's document on JSON is (was) the top search result for JSONP. It says this:

Huh? What call? That doesn't make any sense to me. JSON is a data format. There's no call.

  JSONP is script tag injection, passing the response from the server in to a user specified function.

Addendum: I've just created a new page for JSONP on Wikipedia; it now has a clear and thorough description of JSONP, based on jvenema's answer.
"	2067472	"JSONP (JSON with Padding) is a technique for overcoming the same-origin policy limitations of web browsers, which prevent a web page from making requests to a different domain than the one the web page originated from.

JSONP works by wrapping the JSON data in a function call, and then returning the data to the web page as a script file. The web page specifies the function name to be called in the URL of the JSONP request. When the server returns the JSON data wrapped in the specified function, the browser executes the function and passes the JSON data as an argument.

JSONP was created as a workaround to allow communication between domains, when the same-origin policy was preventing regular AJAX (XMLHttpRequest) requests. JSONP was widely used in the early days of the web, before the introduction of CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing), which provides a standard way for a web page to make requests to a different domain.

You would use JSONP in situations where you need to make a request to a server in a different domain, and CORS is not supported or is not a suitable solution. JSONP can be a simple and effective solution, but it has some limitations and security concerns, so it's not always the best choice.

When a single-argument constructor is declared explicit, it cannot be used to perform implicit conversions. For example, consider the following code:

"Class (static) variables and methods
How do I create class (i.e. static) variables or methods in Python?
"	68645	"In Python, you can create static variables by declaring a variable inside a class but outside any method using the staticmethod or classmethod decorator. The difference between the two is that classmethod receives the class as its first argument, while staticmethod does not receive any special first argument.

Here's an example of using a static variable:

ruby

class MyClass:
    static_variable = 42
    
    @staticmethod
    def static_method():
        print(MyClass.static_variable)

And here's an example of using a class method:

python

class MyClass:
    static_variable = 42
    
    @classmethod
    def class_method(cls):
        print(cls.static_variable)

You can access static variables or methods by referencing the class name, like so:

python

MyClass.static_variable  # 42
MyClass.static_method()  # 42
MyClass.class_method()   # 42

"What are drawbacks or disadvantages of singleton pattern?
The singleton pattern is a fully paid up member of the GoF's patterns book, but it lately seems rather orphaned by the developer world. I still use quite a lot of singletons, especially for factory classes, and while you have to be a bit careful about multithreading issues (like any class actually), I fail to see why they are so awful.
Stack Overflow especially seems to assume that everyone agrees that Singletons are evil. Why?
Please support your answers with ""facts, references, or specific expertise""
"	137975	"There are several drawbacks or disadvantages of using the singleton pattern:

    Global State: Singletons introduce global state into your application, making it harder to reason about the flow of data and state changes. This can lead to tight coupling between objects, making it harder to maintain and test your code.

    Testing difficulties: Singletons can be difficult to test, as they are tightly coupled to the rest of the application and cannot be easily substituted with mock objects. This can lead to slow, difficult-to-maintain test suites.

    Dependency Injection: Singletons can be seen as an anti-pattern when used in conjunction with dependency injection, as they undermine the entire purpose of dependency injection, which is to achieve loose coupling between objects.

    Tight coupling: Singletons can lead to tight coupling between objects, making it harder to maintain and test your code.

    Hard to subclass: Singletons can be difficult to subclass, as they often have complex, global state that cannot be easily changed or extended.

These are some of the main criticisms of the singleton pattern. However, it's worth noting that, like any design pattern, singletons have their place in certain situations, such as when a single instance of a class is required to coordinate actions across the system. The key is to be mindful of their limitations and use them appropriately.

"How does JavaScript .prototype work?
I'm not that into dynamic programming languages but I've written my fair share of JavaScript code. I never really got my head around this prototype-based programming, does any one know how this works?

var obj2 = new obj();

But what is the exact purpose of this "".prototype"" property in JavaScript? How does it relate to instantiating objects?
Update: correct way
var obj = new Object(); // not a functional object
obj.prototype.test = function() { alert('Hello?'); }; // this is wrong!
function MyObject() {} // a first class functional object
MyObject.prototype.test = function() { alert('OK'); } // OK
Also these slides really helped a lot.
"	572897	"JavaScript uses prototype-based programming, which is different from class-based programming in languages like Java or C#. In JavaScript, there is no concept of classes, only objects. When you create an object, it has an internal property called prototype, which is a reference to another object.

The prototype property is used to share properties and methods between objects. If you try to access a property or a method on an object and it can't be found, JavaScript will look for it on the object's prototype. This is called prototype chaining, and it is how inheritance is implemented in JavaScript.

In the code example you provided, obj is an instance of the built-in Object object. However, you cannot add properties to obj.prototype directly because obj is not a function object. Functions are used to create objects in JavaScript, and they have their own prototype property.

The correct way to add properties to the prototype of a custom object type is to create a function object and add properties to its prototype property. In the updated code example, you created a function MyObject and added a test method to its prototype property. This way, when you create an instance of MyObject using var obj2 = new MyObject(), it will have access to the test method via prototype chaining."	eu.8a452c88-31c4-45df-ab0a-b2dba7a949c3				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de54bfdc927a3420cc9c97	00023da2e8--63de236e2ff0b42c197a2eab	00023da2e8--63de54bfdc927a3420cc9c97	286ce83192d264c83604997426952e82	APPROVED	2023-02-04T12:51:11.157	+

"NPM vs. Bower vs. Browserify vs. Gulp vs. Grunt vs. Webpack
I'm trying to summarize my knowledge about the most popular JavaScript package managers, bundlers, and task runners. Please correct me if I'm wrong:
npm & bower are package managers. They just download the dependencies and don't know how to build projects on their own. What they know is to call webpack/gulp/grunt after fetching all the dependencies.
bower is like npm, but builds a flattened dependency trees (unlike npm which does it recursively). Meaning npm fetches the dependencies for each dependency (may fetch the same a few times), while bower expects you to manually include sub-dependencies. Sometimes bower and npm are used together for front-end and back-end respectively (since each megabyte might matter in front-end).
grunt and gulp are task runners to automate everything that can be automated (i.e. compile CSS/Sass, optimize images, make a bundle and minify/transpile it).
grunt vs. gulp (is like maven vs. gradle or configuration vs. code). Grunt is based on configuring separate independent tasks, each task opens/handles/closes file. Gulp requires less amount of code and is based on Node streams, which allows it to build pipe chains (w/o reopening the same file) and makes it faster. 
webpack (webpack-dev-server) - for me it's a task runner with hot reloading of changes which allows you to forget about all JS/CSS watchers. 
npm/bower + plugins may replace task runners. Their abilities often intersect so there are different implications if you need to use gulp/grunt over npm + plugins. But task runners are definitely better for complex tasks (e.g. ""on each build create bundle, transpile from ES6 to ES5, run it at all browsers emulators, make screenshots and deploy to dropbox through ftp"").
browserify allows packaging node modules for browsers. browserify vs node's require is actually AMD vs CommonJS.
Questions:
What is webpack & webpack-dev-server? Official documentation says it's a module bundler but for me it's just a task runner. What's the difference?
Where would you use browserify? Can't we do the same with node/ES6 imports? 
When would you use gulp/grunt over npm + plugins?
Please provide examples when you need to use a combination
"	35062852	"You have a good overall understanding of these tools. Here are a few corrections and additional points:

npm and bower are both package managers, but bower was originally created to manage front-end dependencies (e.g. libraries and frameworks) while npm was created for managing back-end dependencies. Nowadays, npm has become the de facto package manager for both front-end and back-end JavaScript packages.
Grunt and gulp are both task runners, but gulp uses a more code-based approach, using JavaScript functions and pipelines to automate tasks, while Grunt uses a configuration file to define tasks.
Webpack is not just a task runner, it's a module bundler. It takes your code and dependencies, and generates static assets (bundles) that can be included in a web page. It also has built-in optimization features like minification, code splitting, and tree shaking. The webpack-dev-server is a development server that uses webpack under the hood, and provides features like hot reloading and automatic bundling on changes.
You would use browserify if you want to use node modules in the browser, for example if you want to use a node module that wasn't designed for use in the browser. It allows you to package your node modules and their dependencies into a single bundle that can be included in a web page, and provides a compatible require function for those modules to use.
You would use gulp or Grunt over npm + plugins when you have complex tasks that require multiple steps and/or multiple plugins. The plugins available through npm can be used with task runners to automate these complex tasks. For example, you could use gulp to compile your Sass into CSS, minify your CSS and JavaScript, and then use webpack to bundle your code.
There is no one-size-fits-all answer for when you need to use a combination of these tools. It depends on the specific requirements of your project and your personal preferences. However, a common combination is to use npm for managing packages, gulp or Grunt for automating tasks, and webpack for bundling your code for the browser."	eu.b1f7971f-13a8-48fa-acae-797f4cecedb4				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de56ef405a38476b4ff73a	00023da2e8--63de236f2ff0b42c197a2f5d	00023da2e8--63de56ef405a38476b4ff73a	286ce83192d264c83604997426952e82	APPROVED	2023-02-04T13:00:31.968	+

"Make a div fill the height of the remaining screen space
I am working on a web application where I want the content to fill the height of the entire screen.
The page has a header, which contains a logo, and account information. This could be an arbitrary height. I want the content div to fill the rest of the page to the bottom.
I have a header div and a content div. At the moment I am using a table for the layout like so:
CSS and HTML
#page {
    height: 100%; width: 100%
}
#tdcontent {
    height: 100%;
}
#content {
    overflow: auto; /* or overflow: hidden; */

        <td id=""tdcontent"">
            <div id=""content"">...</div>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>
The entire height of the page is filled, and no scrolling is required.
For anything inside the content div, setting top: 0; will put it right underneath the header. Sometimes the content will be a real table, with its height set to 100%. Putting header inside content will not allow this to work.
Is there a way to achieve the same effect without using the table?
Update:
Elements inside the content div will have heights set to percentages as well. So something at 100% inside the div will fill it to the bottom. As will two elements at 50%.
Update 2:
For instance, if the header takes up 20% of the screen's height, a table specified at 50% inside #content would take up 40% of the screen space. So far, wrapping the entire thing in a table is the only thing that works.

"What is the purpose of .PHONY in a Makefile?
What does .PHONY mean in a Makefile? I have gone through this, but it is too complicated.
Can somebody explain it to me in simple terms?
"	2145590	"The .PHONY target in a Makefile is used to specify that a target is not a real file and its dependencies should always be built, even if a file with the same name exists in the file system. It is a way to specify which targets are considered ""phony"" (fake) and should always run their commands, rather than just updating the target if it's considered ""out of date"".

For example, if you have a clean target in your Makefile, you might want to specify it as .PHONY so that make clean always runs the specified commands to clean up your project, regardless of whether a file named clean exists in your file system or not.

In simple terms, .PHONY makes sure that a target always runs its specified commands, rather than just updating the target if its dependencies change."	eu.5780ef73-c13b-4f77-8daa-2ee490943d5f				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de5c702ff0b42c198518f1	00023da2e8--63de236b2ff0b42c197a2dba	00023da2e8--63de5c702ff0b42c198518f1	d8e61a54e640dc786924fbd68be12067	APPROVED	2023-02-04T13:24:00.653	+

How do I format a Date object to a string?
"	3552461	"In JavaScript, you can format a Date object to a string using the toLocaleDateString() or toLocaleString() method. These methods allow you to specify the locale and date/time format.

console.log(date.toLocaleDateString('en-US', options));

const date = new Date();
const year = date.getFullYear();
const month = date.getMonth() + 1; // 0-based

"When should static_cast, dynamic_cast, const_cast, and reinterpret_cast be used?
What are the proper uses of:
static_cast
dynamic_cast
const_cast
reinterpret_cast
(type)value (C-style cast)
type(value) (function-style cast)
How does one decide which to use in which specific cases?
"	332030	"static_cast is used for type casting between compatible data types. It can perform conversions such as int to float, derived class to base class, and void pointer to any other pointer type. static_cast performs only basic type checking and is used for low-level conversions that the programmer fully understands and trusts.

dynamic_cast is used for type casting between related classes in an inheritance hierarchy. It performs a runtime check to ensure that the type being cast to is indeed the correct type. If the cast fails, a nullptr is returned. dynamic_cast is typically used when working with polymorphic objects and is a safer alternative to static_cast in such cases.

const_cast is used to remove or add the const qualifier from a variable. This can be useful when passing a const argument to a function that does not accept a const argument.

reinterpret_cast is used for low-level bit manipulation and conversions that do not preserve the underlying value. reinterpret_cast can be used to convert a pointer of one type to a pointer of another type, even if the types are not related. This can result in undefined behavior and should be used with caution.

The C-style cast (type)value is a shorthand for static_cast, but also includes reinterpret_cast and const_cast. It is often used for quick and dirty type casting, but is considered less safe than the other casting methods as it can cause unexpected behavior and make code harder to understand and maintain.

The function-style cast type(value) is a shorthand for static_cast.

When deciding which cast to use, it's important to consider the safety of the operation, the compatibility of the data types, and the purpose of the cast. If the purpose is to convert between compatible data types, use static_cast. If the purpose is to perform a type check on an object in an inheritance hierarchy, use dynamic_cast. If the purpose is to modify the const qualifier, use const_cast. And if the purpose is to perform low-level bit manipulation, use reinterpret_cast only if necessary and with caution.

"Generate random number between two numbers in JavaScript
Is there a way to generate a random number in a specified range with JavaScript ?
For example: a specified range from 1 to 6 were the random number could be either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
"	4959975	"Yes, you can generate a random number in a specified range in JavaScript using the Math.random() function. The Math.random() function returns a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).

Here is an example of generating a random number between 1 and 6 (inclusive):

lua
Copy code
function getRandomIntInclusive(min, max) {
  min = Math.ceil(min);
  max = Math.floor(max);
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min;
}

console.log(getRandomIntInclusive(1, 6));
This function uses Math.ceil() and Math.floor() to ensure that the resulting random number is an integer within the specified range.

What is a smart pointer and when should I use one?
"	106508	"A smart pointer is a type of object in C++ that acts like a pointer, but with additional features and automatic memory management. They are designed to help prevent common memory management problems, such as memory leaks and use-after-free bugs, by automatically freeing dynamically allocated memory when it is no longer needed.

There are several types of smart pointers in C++, including std::unique_ptr, std::shared_ptr, and std::weak_ptr.

You should use smart pointers whenever you need to dynamically allocate memory in your C++ program. By using smart pointers, you can ensure that memory is automatically freed when it is no longer needed, even if an exception is thrown, which helps to prevent memory leaks and other related issues. Additionally, smart pointers provide a safer, more convenient way to manage dynamically allocated memory than traditional raw pointers.

Smart pointers are especially useful when working with complex data structures, such as trees and graphs, where the lifetime of dynamically allocated objects is difficult to manage manually. By using smart pointers, you can simplify the management of dynamically allocated memory and reduce the risk of memory-related bugs in your code.

""Static cast"" is a type of cast that performs compile-time type checking. It can convert any compatible data type to any other compatible data type. If the cast fails, the program will not compile.

""Dynamic cast"" is a type of cast that performs run-time type checking. It can only be used to cast a pointer or reference to a derived class to a pointer or reference to a base class. If the cast fails, a null pointer or exception is returned.

In summary:

Use regular cast if you need to perform a conversion that is not possible with other casts.
Use static cast if you are sure the conversion is safe and want to avoid run-time checks.
Use dynamic cast if you need to perform a downcast (i.e., cast from base class to derived class) and need to check at runtime if the cast is valid."	eu.61976e8c-d1f8-4322-a0ac-162379e3ecab				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de6056e0fa774101ec6345	00023da2e8--63de23702ff0b42c197a2fd8	00023da2e8--63de6056e0fa774101ec6345	d8e61a54e640dc786924fbd68be12067	APPROVED	2023-02-04T13:40:38.790	+

".prop() vs .attr()
So jQuery 1.6 has the new function prop().
$(selector).click(function(){
    //instead of:
    this.getAttribute('style');
    //do i use:
    $(this).prop('style');
    //or:
    $(this).attr('style');
})
or in this case do they do the same thing?
And if I do have to switch to using prop(), all the old attr() calls will break if i switch to 1.6?
UPDATE
selector = '#id'
$(selector).click(function() {
    //instead of:
    var getAtt = this.getAttribute('style');
    //do i use:
    var thisProp = $(this).prop('style');
    //or:
    var thisAttr = $(this).attr('style');
    console.log(getAtt, thisProp, thisAttr);
});
<script src=""https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.0/jquery.min.js""></script>
<div id='id' style=""color: red;background: orange;"">test</div>

"	5874652	"In general, .prop() is used to get/set properties, whereas .attr() is used to get/set attributes. Properties are the values of the DOM elements that are dynamically changeable, whereas attributes are the default values for those properties, set in the HTML code.

For the style property, .prop('style') returns a CSSStyleDeclaration object, whereas .attr('style') returns a string representation of the style attribute.

In the given code, getAttribute returns a string, .attr('style') returns a string, and .prop('style') returns a CSSStyleDeclaration object.

In general, it's recommended to use .prop() when working with properties, and .attr() when working with attributes. If you switch from using .attr() to .prop(), your code may not break, but the returned value may not be what you expect.

It's important to note that .prop() was introduced in jQuery 1.6, so if you're using an earlier version of jQuery, .prop() will not be available and you would need to stick to using .attr().

Example: stackoverflow.com - when an image is inserted onto the editor panel and the image is too large to fit onto the page, the image is automatically resized.
"	3029422	"You can use CSS to auto-resize an image to fit a div container. To maintain the aspect ratio of the image, set the width of the image to 100% and specify a ""max-width"" and ""max-height"" value.

css

img {

"What is the ""N+1 selects problem"" in ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)?
The ""N+1 selects problem"" is generally stated as a problem in Object-Relational mapping (ORM) discussions, and I understand that it has something to do with having to make a lot of database queries for something that seems simple in the object world.
Does anybody have a more detailed explanation of the problem?
"	97197	"The ""N+1 selects problem"" refers to the performance issue that arises when using ORMs to interact with a relational database. It occurs when a single parent object is retrieved from the database, followed by multiple child objects, resulting in ""N+1"" database queries.

Here's an example to illustrate the problem: consider a scenario where you have a ""User"" object that has many ""Orders"". To display all the orders of a user, you might write code that first retrieves the user object, and then retrieves all of their orders. With an ORM, the code would look something like this:

makefile

# First query to retrieve the user object
user = User.find(user_id)

# One additional query per order to retrieve the orders
orders = [Order.find(order_id) for order_id in user.order_ids]

In this example, you would end up with N+1 database queries, where N is the number of orders for the user. This is inefficient because it creates an excessive number of round trips to the database for data that is related, leading to poor performance, particularly when N is large.

To avoid the N+1 selects problem, you can use techniques such as eager loading or batch loading to load related data in a single query, reducing the number of round trips to the database."	eu.cd765f14-1c04-4a95-ad36-46ef15d99eb1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de62932ff0b42c198632e8	00023da2e8--63de236e2ff0b42c197a2f13	00023da2e8--63de62932ff0b42c198632e8	eecfce578ec8f52e1db33743c0b80f7f	APPROVED	2023-02-04T13:50:11.938	+

"	3058	"Inversion of Control (IoC) is a design principle in which the flow of control of a system is reversed, meaning that instead of the client code controlling the flow, it is the framework or the container that controls the flow of execution.

IoC solves the problem of tight coupling between the client code and the implementation, which can make the system rigid, hard to maintain, and difficult to test. By using IoC, the client code can be decoupled from the implementation and can be easily swapped with another implementation without affecting the client code.

IoC is appropriate to use when building applications that are complex, with multiple dependencies, or when creating reusable components. It is not appropriate to use when the application is simple and has limited dependencies, as it can add unnecessary complexity and overhead to the system."	eu.d0bb409a-669b-44dc-a7c6-c904b052ded5				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de6372aff36b55e4d23948	00023da2e8--63de236d2ff0b42c197a2e50	00023da2e8--63de6372aff36b55e4d23948	eecfce578ec8f52e1db33743c0b80f7f	APPROVED	2023-02-04T13:53:54.312	+	
"event.preventDefault() vs. return false
When I want to prevent other event handlers from executing after a certain event is fired, I can use one of two techniques. I'll use jQuery in the examples, but this applies to plain-JS as well:
1. event.preventDefault()
$('a').click(function (e) {
    // custom handling here
    e.preventDefault();
});
2. return false
$('a').click(function () {
    // custom handling here
    return false;
});
Is there any significant difference between those two methods of stopping event propagation?
For me, return false; is simpler, shorter and probably less error prone than executing a method. With the method, you have to remember about correct casing, parenthesis, etc. 
Also, I have to define the first parameter in callback to be able to call the method. Perhaps, there are some reasons why I should avoid doing it like this and use preventDefault instead? What's the better way?
"	1357118	Both event.preventDefault() and return false serve the same purpose in stopping event propagation, but there is a difference between them. event.preventDefault() only prevents the default behavior of the event, while return false also stops the propagation of the event to its parent elements. So, if you only need to prevent the default behavior, use event.preventDefault(), but if you also need to stop the propagation, use return false. In terms of which is better, it depends on your specific use case, but using event.preventDefault() is generally considered best practice as it provides more fine-grained control over the events.	eu.2560752e-d460-4448-b7c0-ac27e17d4e73				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de637e2ff0b42c19865a3d	00023da2e8--63de23662ff0b42c197a2b5f	00023da2e8--63de637e2ff0b42c19865a3d	d8e61a54e640dc786924fbd68be12067	APPROVED	2023-02-04T13:54:06.260	+

They are particularly useful when you need to group a pattern but do not need to capture the text matched by the group.

For example, consider the following pattern: (a(?:b|c)). The group (a(?:b|c)) is a non-capturing group, and the group (b|c) is a capturing group. The pattern matches the string ""ab"" or ""ac"", but only the text matched by the capturing group is stored, which is either ""b"" or ""c"".

"AngularJS: Service vs provider vs factory
What are the differences between a Service, Provider and Factory in AngularJS?
"	15666048	"In AngularJS, Service, Provider, and Factory are all different ways to create reusable objects that can be shared across multiple components in an application.

    Service: A Service is a simple function that is created using the .service method. It is the simplest way to create a reusable object, and it is mainly used for data and logic that needs to be shared between multiple controllers.

    Factory: A Factory is a more flexible way to create reusable objects, as it can return any value, including objects, functions, and primitive values. It is created using the .factory method, and it is a more commonly used option as it provides more control over the object that is returned.

    Provider: A Provider is the most powerful and flexible way to create reusable objects in AngularJS, as it allows you to configure the object before it is created and returned to the consumer. It is created using the .provider method, and it is mainly used for objects that require configuration, such as a service that needs to be configured with an API endpoint.

In conclusion, while Service and Factory provide simple and flexible ways to create reusable objects, Provider offers the most control over the configuration and creation of these objects.

.gitignore is used to specify files and directories that Git should ignore and not track. When a file or directory is listed in .gitignore, Git will not stage changes made to those files and will not track them in the repository.

.gitkeep, on the other hand, is a placeholder file that is used to keep an empty directory in a Git repository. An empty directory in Git is ignored and will not be tracked unless a .gitkeep file is added to it.

In other words, .gitignore is used to ignore files and directories that should not be tracked, while .gitkeep is used to keep empty directories that should be tracked."	eu.b75dd965-033d-4d82-8194-b1252f6b93cf				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de69132ff0b42c19875d0a	00023da2e8--63de236a2ff0b42c197a2d4c	00023da2e8--63de69132ff0b42c19875d0a	d8e61a54e640dc786924fbd68be12067	APPROVED	2023-02-04T14:17:55.376	+	
"How do I make a placeholder for a 'select' box?

Then, you can use CSS to style the default selected option with a light gray color:

"Improve INSERT-per-second performance of SQLite
Optimizing SQLite is tricky. Bulk-insert performance of a C application can vary from 85 inserts per second to over 96,000 inserts per second!
Background: We are using SQLite as part of a desktop application. We have large amounts of configuration data stored in XML files that are parsed and loaded into an SQLite database for further processing when the application is initialized. SQLite is ideal for this situation because it's fast, it requires no specialized configuration, and the database is stored on disk as a single file.
Rationale: Initially I was disappointed with the performance I was seeing. It turns-out that the performance of SQLite can vary significantly (both for bulk-inserts and selects) depending on how the database is configured and how you're using the API. It was not a trivial matter to figure out what all of the options and techniques were, so I thought it prudent to create this community wiki entry to share the results with Stack Overflow readers in order to save others the trouble of the same investigations.
The Experiment: Rather than simply talking about performance tips in the general sense (i.e. ""Use a transaction!""), I thought it best to write some C code and actually measure the impact of various options. We're going to start with some simple data:
A 28 MB TAB-delimited text file (approximately 865,000 records) of the complete transit schedule for the city of Toronto
My test machine is a 3.60 GHz P4 running Windows XP.
The code is compiled with Visual C++ 2005 as ""Release"" with ""Full Optimization"" (/Ox) and Favor Fast Code (/Ot).
I'm using the SQLite ""Amalgamation"", compiled directly into my test application. The SQLite version I happen to have is a bit older (3.6.7), but I suspect these results will be comparable to the latest release (please leave a comment if you think otherwise).
Let's write some code!
The Code: A simple C program that reads the text file line-by-line, splits the string into values and then inserts the data into an SQLite database. In this ""baseline"" version of the code, the database is created, but we won't actually insert data:
/*************************************************************
    Baseline code to experiment with SQLite performance.

    sqlite3_close(db);
    return 0;
}
The ""Control""
Running the code as-is doesn't actually perform any database operations, but it will give us an idea of how fast the raw C file I/O and string processing operations are.
Imported 864913 records in 0.94
seconds
Great! We can do 920,000 inserts per second, provided we don't actually do any inserts :-)
The ""Worst-Case-Scenario""
We're going to generate the SQL string using the values read from the file and invoke that SQL operation using sqlite3_exec:
sprintf(sSQL, ""INSERT INTO TTC VALUES (NULL, '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s')"", sRT, sBR, sVR, sST, sVI, sDT, sTM);
sqlite3_exec(db, sSQL, NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);
This is going to be slow because the SQL will be compiled into VDBE code for every insert and every insert will happen in its own transaction. How slow?
Imported 864913 records in 9933.61
seconds
Yikes! 2 hours and 45 minutes! That's only 85 inserts per second.
Using a Transaction
By default, SQLite will evaluate every INSERT / UPDATE statement within a unique transaction. If performing a large number of inserts, it's advisable to wrap your operation in a transaction:
sqlite3_exec(db, ""BEGIN TRANSACTION"", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);
pFile = fopen (INPUTDATA,""r"");
while (!feof(pFile)) {
    ...
}
fclose (pFile);
sqlite3_exec(db, ""END TRANSACTION"", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);
Imported 864913 records in 38.03
seconds
That's better. Simply wrapping all of our inserts in a single transaction improved our performance to 23,000 inserts per second.
Using a Prepared Statement
Using a transaction was a huge improvement, but recompiling the SQL statement for every insert doesn't make sense if we using the same SQL over-and-over. Let's use sqlite3_prepare_v2 to compile our SQL statement once and then bind our parameters to that statement using sqlite3_bind_text:
/* Open input file and import into the database */
cStartClock = clock();
sprintf(sSQL, ""INSERT INTO TTC VALUES (NULL, @RT, @BR, @VR, @ST, @VI, @DT, @TM)"");
sqlite3_prepare_v2(db,  sSQL, BUFFER_SIZE, &stmt, &tail);
sqlite3_exec(db, ""BEGIN TRANSACTION"", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);
pFile = fopen (INPUTDATA,""r"");
while (!feof(pFile)) {
    fgets (sInputBuf, BUFFER_SIZE, pFile);
    sRT = strtok (sInputBuf, ""\t"");   /* Get Route */

Nice! There's a little bit more code (don't forget to call sqlite3_clear_bindings and sqlite3_reset), but we've more than doubled our performance to 53,000 inserts per second.
PRAGMA synchronous = OFF
By default, SQLite will pause after issuing a OS-level write command. This guarantees that the data is written to the disk. By setting synchronous = OFF, we are instructing SQLite to simply hand-off the data to the OS for writing and then continue. There's a chance that the database file may become corrupted if the computer suffers a catastrophic crash (or power failure) before the data is written to the platter:
/* Open the database and create the schema */
sqlite3_open(DATABASE, &db);
sqlite3_exec(db, TABLE, NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, ""PRAGMA synchronous = OFF"", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);
Imported 864913 records in 12.41
seconds
The improvements are now smaller, but we're up to 69,600 inserts per second.
PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY
Consider storing the rollback journal in memory by evaluating PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY. Your transaction will be faster, but if you lose power or your program crashes during a transaction you database could be left in a corrupt state with a partially-completed transaction:
/* Open the database and create the schema */
sqlite3_open(DATABASE, &db);
sqlite3_exec(db, TABLE, NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, ""PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY"", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);
Imported 864913 records in 13.50
seconds
A little slower than the previous optimization at 64,000 inserts per second.
PRAGMA synchronous = OFF and PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY
Let's combine the previous two optimizations. It's a little more risky (in case of a crash), but we're just importing data (not running a bank):
/* Open the database and create the schema */
sqlite3_open(DATABASE, &db);
sqlite3_exec(db, TABLE, NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, ""PRAGMA synchronous = OFF"", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, ""PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY"", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);
Imported 864913 records in 12.00
seconds
Fantastic! We're able to do 72,000 inserts per second.
Using an In-Memory Database
Just for kicks, let's build upon all of the previous optimizations and redefine the database filename so we're working entirely in RAM:
#define DATABASE "":memory:""
Imported 864913 records in 10.94
seconds
It's not super-practical to store our database in RAM, but it's impressive that we can perform 79,000 inserts per second.
Refactoring C Code
Although not specifically an SQLite improvement, I don't like the extra char* assignment operations in the while loop. Let's quickly refactor that code to pass the output of strtok() directly into sqlite3_bind_text(), and let the compiler try to speed things up for us:
pFile = fopen (INPUTDATA,""r"");
while (!feof(pFile)) {
    fgets (sInputBuf, BUFFER_SIZE, pFile);
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 1, strtok (sInputBuf, ""\t""), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT); /* Get Route */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 2, strtok (NULL, ""\t""), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Branch */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 3, strtok (NULL, ""\t""), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Version */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 4, strtok (NULL, ""\t""), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Stop Number */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 5, strtok (NULL, ""\t""), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Vehicle */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 6, strtok (NULL, ""\t""), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Date */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 7, strtok (NULL, ""\t""), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Time */
    sqlite3_step(stmt);        /* Execute the SQL Statement */
    sqlite3_clear_bindings(stmt);    /* Clear bindings */
    sqlite3_reset(stmt);        /* Reset VDBE */
    n++;
}
fclose (pFile);
Note: We are back to using a real database file. In-memory databases are fast, but not necessarily practical
Imported 864913 records in 8.94
seconds
A slight refactoring to the string processing code used in our parameter binding has allowed us to perform 96,700 inserts per second. I think it's safe to say that this is plenty fast. As we start to tweak other variables (i.e. page size, index creation, etc.) this will be our benchmark.
Summary (so far)
I hope you're still with me! The reason we started down this road is that bulk-insert performance varies so wildly with SQLite, and it's not always obvious what changes need to be made to speed-up our operation. Using the same compiler (and compiler options), the same version of SQLite and the same data we've optimized our code and our usage of SQLite to go from a worst-case scenario of 85 inserts per second to over 96,000 inserts per second!
CREATE INDEX then INSERT vs. INSERT then CREATE INDEX
Before we start measuring SELECT performance, we know that we'll be creating indices. It's been suggested in one of the answers below that when doing bulk inserts, it is faster to create the index after the data has been inserted (as opposed to creating the index first then inserting the data). Let's try:
Create Index then Insert Data
sqlite3_exec(db, ""CREATE  INDEX 'TTC_Stop_Index' ON 'TTC' ('Stop')"", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, ""BEGIN TRANSACTION"", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);
...
Imported 864913 records in 18.13
seconds
Insert Data then Create Index
...
sqlite3_exec(db, ""END TRANSACTION"", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, ""CREATE  INDEX 'TTC_Stop_Index' ON 'TTC' ('Stop')"", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);
Imported 864913 records in 13.66
seconds
As expected, bulk-inserts are slower if one column is indexed, but it does make a difference if the index is created after the data is inserted. Our no-index baseline is 96,000 inserts per second. Creating the index first then inserting data gives us 47,700 inserts per second, whereas inserting the data first then creating the index gives us 63,300 inserts per second.
I'd gladly take suggestions for other scenarios to try... And will be compiling similar data for SELECT queries soon.
"	1711631	"There are several ways to improve the INSERT performance of SQLite:

Use transactions: wrap multiple INSERT statements into a single transaction, this can greatly improve the bulk insert performance.
Use prepared statements: compile SQL statements once and execute them multiple times, this can save the overhead of parsing SQL statements multiple times.
Use batch processing: group multiple INSERT statements into a single string and execute it as a single SQL statement, this can reduce the overhead of making multiple trips to the database.
Use the sqlite3_exec function: this function is designed for executing multiple SQL statements at once, which can reduce the overhead of making multiple trips to the database.
Increase the cache size: the cache size affects the performance of SQLite, increasing the cache size can improve the INSERT performance.
Use the WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mode: WAL mode can improve the write performance of SQLite, it's recommended to use it if you need high INSERT performance.
Consider using other databases: If the performance of SQLite is still not sufficient, consider using other databases, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, which may provide better performance for your use case."	eu.fa0e42b4-700b-4bee-9118-c1628604d178				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de6d2b405a38476b52d61a	00023da2e8--63de23652ff0b42c197a2b29	00023da2e8--63de6d2b405a38476b52d61a	286ce83192d264c83604997426952e82	APPROVED	2023-02-04T14:35:23.006	+

An interface and a type in TypeScript are both ways to describe the shape of an object, but they are used in different ways and have different features.

An interface in TypeScript is a contract that defines the structure of an object, including the properties and methods it should have. Interfaces are usually used to describe the structure of complex objects, and can be used for object typing, inheritance, and polymorphism.

A type in TypeScript is a way to give a name to any value, including primitive values, objects, functions, and arrays. A type alias is a type definition that can be used to describe an object, similar to an interface.

In this specific case, both the interface and type alias have the same structure and purpose, but an interface provides more functionality and is the recommended way to describe the structure of an object in TypeScript."	eu.1afd5892-7e6c-45b5-9769-c104a0da231b				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de6f266adb8b18a532748d	00023da2e8--63de236e2ff0b42c197a2ea7	00023da2e8--63de6f266adb8b18a532748d	bfe2fff30b2d57d6435c89930adb2173	APPROVED	2023-02-04T14:43:50.119	+

You can detect if a user is using a mobile device by checking the value of window.innerWidth and window.innerHeight. A common approach is to check if the values are less than a certain threshold (e.g. 720 for width) to determine if the device is a mobile device.

Here's an example of how you can use this approach in jQuery:
if (window.innerWidth <= 720) {
  // Run code for mobile devices
} else {
  // Run code for desktop devices
}
Another option is to use the window.navigator.userAgent property, which returns a string that identifies the browser and version being used. You can check if the user agent string contains keywords such as 'mobile' or 'tablet' to determine the device type.

Here's an example
var isMobile = /iPhone|iPad|iPod|Android/i.test(window.navigator.userAgent);
if (isMobile) {
  // Run code for mobile devices

"	2056	"Model-View-Controller (MVC), Model-View-Presenter (MVP), and Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) are design patterns used to separate the concerns of a software application into separate, testable, and maintainable components.

Issues addressed:

MVC: Addresses the issue of separation of concerns and provides a clear structure for creating applications, allowing multiple developers to work on the same project.
MVP: Addresses the issue of having tight coupling between the view and the controller and reduces the dependencies between them.
MVVM: Addresses the issue of managing the state and behavior of the user interface in a scalable and maintainable way.
Similarities:

All three patterns separate the responsibilities of the application into different components.
All three patterns are used to build graphical user interfaces.
All three patterns aim to make the code more testable and maintainable.
Differences:

MVC: The controller updates the model and updates the view based on the changes in the model.
MVP: The presenter acts as an intermediary between the view and the model and updates the view based on the changes in the model.
MVVM: The view model updates the view based on changes in the model and handles user actions by updating the model. The view model also manages the state of the view.

"Least Astonishment"" and the Mutable Default Argument
Anyone tinkering with Python long enough has been bitten (or torn to pieces) by the following issue:
def foo(a=[]):
    a.append(5)
    return a
Python novices would expect this function called with no parameter to always return a list with only one element: [5]. The result is instead very different, and very astonishing (for a novice):
>>> foo()
[5]
>>> foo()
[5, 5]
>>> foo()
[5, 5, 5]
>>> foo()
[5, 5, 5, 5]
>>> foo()
A manager of mine once had his first encounter with this feature, and called it ""a dramatic design flaw"" of the language. I replied that the behavior had an underlying explanation, and it is indeed very puzzling and unexpected if you don't understand the internals. However, I was not able to answer (to myself) the following question: what is the reason for binding the default argument at function definition, and not at function execution? I doubt the experienced behavior has a practical use (who really used static variables in C, without breeding bugs?)
Edit:
Baczek made an interesting example. Together with most of your comments and Utaal's in particular, I elaborated further:
>>> def a():
...     print(""a executed"")
...     return []
... 
>>>            
>>> def b(x=a()):
...     x.append(5)
...     print(x)
... 
a executed
>>> b()
[5]
>>> b()
[5, 5]
To me, it seems that the design decision was relative to where to put the scope of parameters: inside the function, or ""together"" with it?
Doing the binding inside the function would mean that x is effectively bound to the specified default when the function is called, not defined, something that would present a deep flaw: the def line would be ""hybrid"" in the sense that part of the binding (of the function object) would happen at definition, and part (assignment of default parameters) at function invocation time.
The actual behavior is more consistent: everything of that line gets evaluated when that line is executed, meaning at function definition."	1132941	The reason for binding the default argument at function definition and not at function execution is to allow for efficient implementation of the language and consistency in the language design. The default value for an argument is evaluated when the function is defined and not re-evaluated every time the function is called. This is because the default argument is meant to be a static value and not a value that changes with each function call. This behavior makes the language more consistent, as all parts of a function definition are evaluated when the function is defined and not when it is executed. However, it can lead to unexpected results when the default argument is mutable, as demonstrated in the example you provided.	eu.d58c5426-c0a0-4ad0-9bf8-6903eba17a4b				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de7365e6591d31e4f843c0	00023da2e8--63de23652ff0b42c197a2b32	00023da2e8--63de7365e6591d31e4f843c0	e94a0e4a9bc57c10ae8b01b0d910b306	APPROVED	2023-02-04T15:01:57.791	+

"	285793	"serialVersionUID is a unique identifier for a serializable class in Java. It is used to verify that the class being deserialized matches the class that was originally serialized.

If a class changes its structure in a way that affects serialization (e.g., adding or removing a field), and the serialVersionUID is not updated accordingly, the deserialization process will fail, leading to an InvalidClassException.

Here is an example of a class that declares a serialVersionUID:

ArrayList is backed by an array and provides constant-time access to elements by index. So, if you frequently need to access elements at random indices, or search for elements in the list, ArrayList is a good choice.

On the other hand, LinkedList is implemented as a linked list, so inserting or deleting elements in the middle of the list takes constant time on average, but accessing an element by index takes linear time. So, if you frequently add or remove elements in the middle of the list, LinkedList is a better choice.

"Difference between static class and singleton pattern?
What real (i.e. practical) difference exists between a static class and a singleton pattern?
Both can be invoked without instantiation, both provide only one ""Instance"" and neither of them is thread-safe. Is there any other difference?
"	519520	"Yes, there are some differences between a static class and a singleton pattern.

Inheritance: A static class cannot be inherited, whereas a singleton class can be inherited but it must be taken care that only one instance of the derived class is created.

Flexibility: A static class is less flexible as it cannot be extended, whereas a singleton class can be easily extended or modified.

Lazy Initialization: A singleton class can have a lazy initialization, which means that its instance is created only when it is needed. On the other hand, a static class is initialized when the program starts.

Dependency Injection: A singleton class can be used in Dependency Injection, whereas a static class cannot be used in DI as it cannot be instantiated.

In summary, while both static classes and singletons serve the purpose of providing a single instance, singletons offer more flexibility and are more suited for complex cases where inheritance and lazy initialization are required."	eu.ad996e3c-b3a3-4a23-8f64-6602ad0bb88b				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de774ee0fa774101ef322e	00023da2e8--63de23702ff0b42c197a2faa	00023da2e8--63de774ee0fa774101ef322e	e94a0e4a9bc57c10ae8b01b0d910b306	APPROVED	2023-02-04T15:18:38.821	+

"How can I create a memory leak in Java?
I just had an interview where I was asked to create a memory leak with Java.
Needless to say, I felt pretty dumb, having no idea how to start creating one.
What would an example be?
"	6470651	"Creating a memory leak in Java is possible if objects are kept in memory, even though they are no longer needed by the application. This can happen in several ways, including:

Holding onto references to objects that are no longer needed: For example, creating an object and storing it in a static field, even after it is no longer needed.

Creating circular references: This happens when objects reference each other, creating a cycle that cannot be broken by the garbage collector.

Failing to close resources: Failing to close resources such as InputStreams, OutputStreams, and database connections can prevent the garbage collector from freeing the memory associated with these resources.

Caching: Caching objects for an extended period of time, even after they are no longer needed, can lead to a memory leak.

Here is an example of a memory leak caused by holding onto references to objects that are no longer needed:

java
Copy code

  private static List<byte[]> cache = new ArrayList<>();

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    while (true) {
      cache.add(new byte[1024 * 1024]);
    }
  }
}
This code continuously adds new byte arrays to the cache list, but it never removes them, which will result in a memory leak. The garbage collector cannot reclaim the memory associated with these objects because they are still being referenced by the cache list."	eu.5e26f7de-d594-44cb-bf04-50c3e0b1ac0a				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de7bc8c934756c0b0dc1f5	00023da2e8--63de23642ff0b42c197a2a9a	00023da2e8--63de7bc8c934756c0b0dc1f5	d8e61a54e640dc786924fbd68be12067	APPROVED	2023-02-04T15:37:44.960	+

What is dependency injection and when/why should or shouldn't it be used?

When should it be used?

When the components in a software application are tightly coupled and difficult to maintain.
When you want to isolate the effects of changes in one component from others.
When you want to improve testability of your code by allowing dependencies to be swapped or mocked.
When shouldn't it be used?

"Flash CS4 refuses to let go
I have a Flash project, and it has many source files. I have a fairly heavily-used class, call it Jenine. I recently (and, perhaps, callously) relocated Jenine from one namespace to another. I thought we were ready - I thought it was time. The new Jenine was better in every way - she had lost some code bloat, she had decoupled herself from a few vestigial class relationships, and she had finally come home to the namespace that she had always secretly known in her heart was the one she truly belonged to. She was among her own kind.
Unfortunately, Flash would have none of that. Perhaps it had formed an attachment. Perhaps it didn't want Jenine to be decoupled. Either way, it clung to the old, perfect version of Jenine in its memory. It refused to move on. It ignored her (function) calls. It tried to forget her new, public interfaces. Instead, every instance of Jenine that it constructed was always a copy of the old version, down to its classpath:
var jenineInstance:Jenine = new Jenine();
trace( getQualifiedClassName(jenineInstance));
// Should print: com.newnamespace.subspace::Jenine
// Prints: com.oldnamespace.subspace::Jenine
// Ah, young love!
We fought. I'm not proud of some of the things I said or did. In the end, in a towering fit of rage, I deleted all references of Jenine completely. She was utterly, completely erased from the system. My cursor fell upon the ""Empty Trash"" menu option like the cold lid of a casket.
I don't think Flash ever recovered. To this day it still clings to the memory of Jenine. Her old, imperfect definitions still float through my project like abandoned ghosts.

Most days it just mopes around and writes bad poetry in my comments when it thinks I'm not looking.
I hope no one else has had a similar experience, that this is just a singular, painful ripple in the horrifying dark lagoon that is the Flash code-base. Does anyone have any idea how to erase whatever cache the compiler is using?

"	285177	"Yes, it's possible to call one constructor from another constructor within the same class in Java. To do this, you can use the this keyword followed by the constructor signature.

"What does O(log n) mean exactly?
I am learning about Big O Notation running times and amortized times.  I understand the notion of O(n) linear time, meaning that the size of the input affects the growth of the algorithm proportionally...and the same goes for, for example, quadratic time O(n2) etc..even algorithms, such as permutation generators, with O(n!) times, that grow by factorials.
For example, the following function is O(n) because the algorithm grows in proportion to its input n:
f(int n) {
  int i;
  for (i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    printf(""%d"", i);
}
Similarly, if there was a nested loop, the time would be O(n2).
But what exactly is O(log n)?  For example, what does it mean to say that the height of a complete binary tree is O(log n)?
I do know (maybe not in great detail) what Logarithm is, in the sense that:  log10 100 = 2, but I cannot understand how to identify a function with a logarithmic time.
"	2307283	"O(log n) means that the growth rate of the algorithm is logarithmic. It means that the size of the input affects the growth of the algorithm such that the amount of operations performed increases logarithmically with the size of the input.

For example, when you are searching for an item in a sorted array using a binary search algorithm, you keep dividing the search space in half until you find the item or determine that it is not in the array. The number of operations required to find the item is proportional to the logarithm of the size of the array. This is why binary search is considered to have a time complexity of O(log n).

In the case of the height of a complete binary tree, it means that the height of the tree is proportional to the logarithm of the total number of nodes in the tree. This is because in a complete binary tree, the number of nodes in each level is multiplied by 2 as you move down the levels. The logarithmic relationship between the height of the tree and the number of nodes ensures that searching and traversing operations in the tree are efficient."	eu.9bd2bdf9-38b4-4dd4-9744-93b2860dd4c0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de973e6adb8b18a539fbdc	00023da2e8--63de23692ff0b42c197a2cc1	00023da2e8--63de973e6adb8b18a539fbdc	f677e87c895514618a26b7987e743586	APPROVED	2023-02-04T17:34:54.473	+

A Context object is required for most Android API calls, and can be used to retrieve information about the activity, service, or application in which it is running. Some common uses of Context include accessing system services (such as the LayoutInflater, NotificationManager, and ActivityManager), starting activities, or accessing resources.

In general, a Context should be passed as a parameter to methods that need access to information about the environment in which they are running. The Context can be obtained in various ways, such as by calling getContext() on an activity, or getApplicationContext() to obtain the application context."	eu.c605e02a-637f-4195-8349-83656c07d3f6				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de99d06adb8b18a53a6ceb	00023da2e8--63de236d2ff0b42c197a2e64	00023da2e8--63de99d06adb8b18a53a6ceb	d8e61a54e640dc786924fbd68be12067	APPROVED	2023-02-04T17:45:52.019	+

Tiny benchmark addendum and recap
For completeness, I thought I'd update the read speed for the same file on the same box with the original (synced) C++ code. Again, this is for a 100M line file on a fast disk. Here's the comparison, with several solutions/approaches:
Implementation
Lines per second
python (default)
3,571,428
cin (default/naive)
819,672
cin (no sync)
12,500,000
fgets
14,285,714
wc (not fair comparison)
54,644,808
"	9371238	The difference in performance between the Python and C++ code is due to the difference in implementation of the standard I/O library. The C++ implementation, cin, is synchronized with stdout by default, which slows down input processing. The Python equivalent, sys.stdin, does not have this issue. To make the C++ code faster, you can add the following statement: cin.sync_with_stdio(false) or use fgets instead of getline.	eu.8e74cbc7-e0b0-4dc9-830f-8e13887e2c3b				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de9a166adb8b18a53a7b28	00023da2e8--63de236e2ff0b42c197a2ee8	00023da2e8--63de9a166adb8b18a53a7b28	d8e61a54e640dc786924fbd68be12067	APPROVED	2023-02-04T17:47:02.020	+

"Should I use Vagrant or Docker for creating an isolated environment?
I use Ubuntu for development and deployment and have a need for creating an isolated environment. 
I am considering either Vagrant or Docker for this purpose. What are the pros and cons, or how do these solutions compare?
"	16647069	"Vagrant and Docker are both popular tools for creating isolated environments, but they have different purposes and design goals:

Vagrant:

Pros:

Easy to use and set up, with a user-friendly interface.
Provides a full virtual machine environment that can run any software or OS, which makes it easier to match production environments.
Offers greater flexibility and configurability, as you have full access to the virtual machine.
Cons:

More resource-intensive, as it runs a full virtual machine that needs its own resources such as CPU, memory, and disk space.
Slower to start and stop, as it takes time to spin up and shut down a full virtual machine.
Docker:

Pros:

Lightweight, as it uses containers instead of full virtual machines, which requires fewer resources.
Fast to start and stop, as containers can be created and destroyed quickly.
Good for microservices architecture, where each service can run in its own isolated container.
Cons:

Not as flexible as Vagrant, as you don't have full access to the host operating system.
More challenging to set up and use, as it requires a deeper understanding of containers and the underlying technology.
In conclusion, the choice between Vagrant and Docker depends on the specific requirements of your project and your preferences as a developer. If you need a more flexible and configurable environment, and don't mind the overhead of running a full virtual machine, then Vagrant might be a better choice. If you're looking for a more lightweight solution that is fast to start and stop, and that can be used for microservices architecture, then Docker is the way to go."	eu.a291eab7-1db0-47de-800d-51d95ab5eb6c				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63dea1b0c819b6546db49abd	00023da2e8--63de236d2ff0b42c197a2e90	00023da2e8--63dea1b0c819b6546db49abd	e94a0e4a9bc57c10ae8b01b0d910b306	APPROVED	2023-02-04T18:19:28.274	+

"How to store objects in HTML5 localStorage/sessionStorage
I'd like to store a JavaScript object in HTML5 localStorage, but my object is apparently being converted to a string.
I can store and retrieve primitive JavaScript types and arrays using localStorage, but objects don't seem to work.  Should they?
Here's my code:
var testObject = { 'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3 };
console.log('typeof testObject: ' + typeof testObject);
console.log('testObject properties:');
for (var prop in testObject) {
    console.log('  ' + prop + ': ' + testObject[prop]);
}
// Put the object into storage
localStorage.setItem('testObject', testObject);
// Retrieve the object from storage
var retrievedObject = localStorage.getItem('testObject');
console.log('typeof retrievedObject: ' + typeof retrievedObject);
console.log('Value of retrievedObject: ' + retrievedObject);
The console output is
typeof testObject: object
testObject properties:
  one: 1
  two: 2
  three: 3
typeof retrievedObject: string
Value of retrievedObject: [object Object]
It looks to me like the setItem method is converting the input to a string before storing it.
I see this behavior in Safari, Chrome, and Firefox, so I assume it's my misunderstanding of the HTML5 Web Storage specification, not a browser-specific bug or limitation.
I've tried to make sense of the structured clone algorithm described in 2 Common infrastructure.  I don't fully understand what it's saying, but maybe my problem has to do with my object's properties not being enumerable (???).
Is there an easy workaround?
Update: The W3C eventually changed their minds about the structured-clone specification, and decided to change the spec to match the implementations.  See 12111 – spec for Storage object getItem(key) method does not match implementation behavior. So this question is no longer 100% valid, but the answers still may be of interest.

"What is tail recursion?
Whilst starting to learn lisp, I've come across the term tail-recursive. What does it mean exactly?
"	33923	Tail recursion is a special case of recursion where the recursive call is the last statement executed in the function. This means that the function does not have any other operations to perform after making the recursive call, and the result of the recursive call can be immediately returned as the result of the function. This allows the function to return its result without consuming additional stack space, as the current stack frame can be reused for the next iteration of the recursion. This can result in much more efficient use of stack space and can prevent stack overflow errors in cases where a normal, non-tail-recursive implementation would run out of stack space.	eu.9983fa5b-c05b-404a-b72b-52986b6e380b				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63dea696ff5a9b28139d1135	00023da2e8--63de23702ff0b42c197a2fc6	00023da2e8--63dea696ff5a9b28139d1135	e94a0e4a9bc57c10ae8b01b0d910b306	APPROVED	2023-02-04T18:40:22.619	+

What is the technical difference between a process and a thread?
I get the feeling a word like 'process' is overused and there are also hardware and software threads. How about light-weight processes in languages like Erlang? Is there a definitive reason to use one term over the other?
"	200469	"A process is an instance of a program in execution, while a thread is a lightweight, independent unit of processing within a process.

A process can contain multiple threads, which run concurrently and share the process's resources such as memory and file descriptors. A thread, on the other hand, has its own execution stack but shares the same data space with other threads in the same process.

In terms of hardware threads, these refer to the physical threads of execution in a multi-threaded processor, whereas software threads are the threads implemented by the operating system or application. Light-weight processes, as in the case of Erlang, are similar to threads but offer additional features such as isolated memory spaces and message-passing concurrency.

The choice between using the term ""process"" or ""thread"" can depend on the context and the level of abstraction one wants to convey. Generally, ""process"" is used to describe the larger unit of execution while ""thread"" is used to describe the smaller, concurrent unit of processing within a process."	eu.b8da57ca-f394-4e83-9d8f-f48c43d3000b				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63dea854350cf706af4a14af	00023da2e8--63de23712ff0b42c197a300a	00023da2e8--63dea854350cf706af4a14af	e94a0e4a9bc57c10ae8b01b0d910b306	APPROVED	2023-02-04T18:47:48.900	+

"How do I safely merge a Git branch into master?
A new branch from master is created, we call it test.
There are several developers who either commit to master or create other branches and later merge into master.
Let's say work on test is taking several days and you want to continuously keep test updated with commits inside master.
I would do git pull origin master from test. 
Question 1: Is this the right approach?  Other developers could have easily worked on same files as I have worked btw.
My work on test is done and I am ready to merge it back to master. Here are the two ways I can think of:
A:  
git checkout test
git pull origin master
git push origin test
git checkout master
git pull origin test 
B: 
git checkout test
git pull origin master
git checkout master
git merge test
I am not using --rebase because from my understanding, rebase will get the changes from master and stack mine on top of that hence it could overwrite changes other people made.
Question 2: Which one of these two methods is right?  What is the difference there?
The goal in all of this is to keep my test branch updated with the things happening in master and later I could merge them back into master hoping to keep the timeline as linear as possible.
"	5601931	"Answer to Question 1:

The right approach to keep the test branch updated with changes made in master is to run git checkout test followed by git pull origin master.

Answer to Question 2:

Both of the methods described are correct and will result in the test branch being merged into master.

Method A:
This method involves first pushing the changes in the test branch to the remote repository, then pulling the changes from the remote repository into the local master branch.

Method B:
This method involves first merging the test branch into the local master branch, then pushing the changes to the remote repository.

The difference between the two methods is that in Method A, the changes from the test branch are first pushed to the remote repository and then pulled into the local master branch, whereas in Method B, the changes are first merged into the local master branch and then pushed to the remote repository.

The goal in either method is to keep the test branch updated with the master branch and to maintain a linear timeline."	eu.2e2be328-cbf6-4547-9832-a65c11e11d17				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63deac28e0fa774101f5c1ca	00023da2e8--63de236a2ff0b42c197a2cff	00023da2e8--63deac28e0fa774101f5c1ca	e94a0e4a9bc57c10ae8b01b0d910b306	APPROVED	2023-02-04T19:04:08.452	+

for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {

}
Compiled on Microsoft Visual C++ 10.0 with full optimization and SSE2 enabled for 32-bit on a Intel Core 2 Duo (x64), the first example takes 5.5 seconds and the double-loop example takes only 1.9 seconds.
Disassembly for the first loop basically looks like this (this block is repeated about five times in the full program):

addsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [ecx+20h]

movsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [esi+18h]

"	8547778	The difference in performance between the two loops is due to cache behavior. When multiple arrays are stored in contiguous memory, as in the first loop, accessing them can result in cache eviction. That is, as the processor tries to access elements of different arrays stored in contiguous memory, some elements of arrays may get evicted from the cache, leading to a cache miss and resulting in slower access. On the other hand, when arrays are stored in separate memory, there is less chance of cache eviction, leading to faster access. Additionally, the cache can handle data in the form of cache lines, and accessing data in separate arrays can result in more cache-friendly access patterns. This can result in better performance.	eu.01a208c2-7773-40b7-bc09-5f732b42f0e2				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63dfa1822ff0b42c19b2708e	00023da2e8--63de236b2ff0b42c197a2d8c	00023da2e8--63dfa1822ff0b42c19b2708e	286ce83192d264c83604997426952e82	APPROVED	2023-02-05T12:30:58.444	+	
"implements Runnable"" vs ""extends Thread"" in Java
From what time I've spent with threads in Java, I've found these two ways to write threads:
With implements Runnable:
public class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        //Code
    }
}
//Started with a ""new Thread(new MyRunnable()).start()"" call
Or, with extends Thread:
public class MyThread extends Thread {
    public MyThread() {
        super(""MyThread"");
    }
    public void run() {
        //Code
    }
}
//Started with a ""new MyThread().start()"" call
Is there any significant difference in these two blocks of code?"	541487	"Yes, there are significant differences between ""implements Runnable"" and ""extends Thread"" in Java.

The primary difference is that extending the Thread class creates a new class that is a subclass of Thread, and therefore can only be used to create objects of that class, whereas implementing the Runnable interface allows the creation of objects that can be passed as a target to a Thread object.

This means that if you extend the Thread class, you cannot extend any other class, as Java does not support multiple inheritance. On the other hand, implementing the Runnable interface allows you to take advantage of multiple inheritance, as a class can implement multiple interfaces.

Another difference is that it is generally considered to be better practice to implement the Runnable interface because it leads to cleaner, more modular code. Additionally, the Runnable interface is more flexible, as it allows you to pass a single Runnable object to multiple threads.

In summary, if you want to create a reusable component that can be run as a thread, use the Runnable interface. If you need to create a new type of thread, extend the Thread class."	eu.bf777bed-877d-4810-9779-5357641b81bd				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63dfa3bf461aef4decf5b6c3	00023da2e8--63de236c2ff0b42c197a2ddf	00023da2e8--63dfa3bf461aef4decf5b6c3	7f2f7d7a68661d5504ed73f5e2d6c486	APPROVED	2023-02-05T12:40:31.998	+	
"Config Error: This configuration section cannot be used at this path
I've encountered an error deploying a site to a server.  When trying to load the home page, or access authentication on the new site in IIS, I get the error:
  Config Error: This configuration section cannot be used at this path.
  This happens when the section is locked at a parent level. Locking is
  either by default (overrideModeDefault=""Deny""), or set explicitly by a
  location tag with overrideMode=""Deny"" or the legacy
  allowOverride=""false"".
More detail can be found here, in Scenario 7 matches my hex error code.
The solution given on the linked site above is to set Allow for overrideModeDefault in the section mentioned in my error, in the applicationHost.config file.  In my case,  under Security in system.webServer.  But if I look at the applicationHost.config on my local computer, where the site is properly deployed already, that section is set to Deny.
If this solution is correct, how is my local instance running just fine with the same web.config?  According to my applicationHost.config, that section should be locked, but it's not.  I'd prefer to not change the applicationHost.config file, because there are many other sites running on that server.  Is there another solution?
"	9794985	"The issue you're encountering is due to the fact that certain sections in your web.config file are locked at a parent level in IIS. This prevents you from making changes to those sections and can result in the error you're seeing.

To resolve this issue without modifying the applicationHost.config file, you can try the following:

Make the changes to the web.config file at the individual website level instead of the server level
Change the section's overrideMode to Allow in the web.config file for the specific website.
If you still face the same error, you can try searching the web.config file for the locked section and see if it is set to ""Deny"" anywhere else. If so, change it to ""Allow"" to allow the changes to take effect.

"How do I make function decorators and chain them together?
How do I make two decorators in Python that would do the following?
@make_bold
@make_italic
def say():
   return ""Hello""
Calling say() should return:
""<b><i>Hello</i></b>""
"	739654	"In Python, function decorators are functions that modify or enhance another function. To make a function decorator in Python, you'll need to define a nested function inside of the decorator that takes a function as an argument, modifies it, and returns the modified function.

Here's an example of how you could define the make_bold and make_italic decorators:

ruby
Copy code
def make_bold(func):
    def wrapper():
        return ""<b>"" + func() + ""</b>""
    return wrapper

def make_italic(func):
    def wrapper():
        return ""<i>"" + func() + ""</i>""
    return wrapper
To chain the decorators together, you'll need to apply them to the say function in the correct order, like this:

less
Copy code
@make_bold
@make_italic
def say():
    return ""Hello""

print(say()) # ""<b><i>Hello</i></b>""
In this example, the say function is first decorated with make_italic, and then with make_bold. The decorators are applied in the reverse order from which they appear in the source code, so the innermost decorator is applied first, followed by the outer decorator."	eu.dc610a47-6e32-4778-8e42-0d0a59d4a914				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63dfa7382ff0b42c19b34313	00023da2e8--63de23662ff0b42c197a2ba8	00023da2e8--63dfa7382ff0b42c19b34313	6237df8d3da739c1e34a0e43a205667d	APPROVED	2023-02-05T12:55:20.441	+	
"What is the JavaScript version of sleep()?
Is there a better way to engineer a sleep in JavaScript than the following pausecomp function (taken from here)?

{
    var date = new Date();
    var curDate = null;
    do { curDate = new Date(); }
    while(curDate-date < millis);

This is not a duplicate of Sleep in JavaScript - delay between actions; I want a real sleep in the middle of a function, and not a delay before a piece of code executes.
"	951021	"JavaScript is inherently single-threaded and doesn't have a sleep() function.

The function you provided, pausecomp(), blocks the execution of the JavaScript thread for the specified time period. While it's possible to use this function, it's not a recommended way to do so. This is because it will block the entire JavaScript engine, making the UI unresponsive and causing other parts of the application to stall.

A better way to handle this type of scenario is to use the setTimeout function, which schedules a function to be executed after a specified time interval has passed. The function will be executed as soon as the JavaScript engine is able to do so, without blocking other parts of the application.

Here's an example:

javascript
Copy code
function sleep(ms) {
  return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
}

async function doSomething() {
  console.log('Sleeping for 3 seconds...');
  await sleep(3000);
  console.log('Awake!');
}
