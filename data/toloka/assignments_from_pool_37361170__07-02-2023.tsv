"How do I undo the most recent local commits in Git?
I accidentally committed the wrong files to Git, but didn't push the commit to the server yet.
How do I undo those commits from the local repository?
"	927358	"You can use the git reset command to undo the most recent local commits in Git. The specific command you would use depends on how far back you want to reset the repository.

To undo the most recent commit, use the command:
git reset HEAD~
This will reset the repository to the state of the commit before the most recent one.

If you want to reset to a specific commit, you can use the commit's hash instead of HEAD~
git reset <commit_hash>
This will reset the repository to the state of the specific commit you specify.

Be careful with using the above command as it will remove all commits after the specified commit and make them unrecoverable.

Once you reset the repository, you can then recommit the files you want to keep."				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37361170/00023a1612--63c9c3f8e4ef243596e55dc7	00023a1612--63c96b36f603361fcb90d3f6	00023a1612--63c9c3f8e4ef243596e55dc7	823c2733aef57d9cc858a636c7965a64	APPROVED	2023-01-19T22:28:08.006	+	
"Which equals operator (== vs ===) should be used in JavaScript comparisons?
I'm using JSLint to go through JavaScript, and it's returning many suggestions to replace == (two equals signs) with === (three equals signs) when doing things like comparing idSele_UNVEHtype.value.length == 0 inside of an if statement.
Is there a performance benefit to replacing == with ===? 
Any performance improvement would be welcomed as many comparison operators exist.
If no type conversion takes place, would there be a performance gain over ==?
"	359494	"In JavaScript, it is generally recommended to use the ""strict equality"" operator (===) when comparing values, rather than the ""loose equality"" operator (==).
Using the strict equality operator will prevent unexpected type conversions from occurring.
For example, if you use the loose equality operator to compare the number 0 and the string ""0"", the comparison will return true, because JavaScript will automatically convert the string to a number before making the comparison.

Using === instead of == in JavaScript, it will not perform any type coercion and will only return true if the operands have the same type and the same value.

There may be some performance benefits to using the strict equality operator in certain cases, as it avoids the need for JavaScript to perform type conversions. However, in most cases the difference in performance is likely to be negligible.

So, it's a good practice to use === instead of == to avoid unexpected results, and in some cases it may also give a slight performance gain."				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37361170/00023a1612--63c9c44d0f3f3063a690d5ed	00023a1612--63c96b37f603361fcb90d4c7	00023a1612--63c9c44d0f3f3063a690d5ed	823c2733aef57d9cc858a636c7965a64	APPROVED	2023-01-19T22:29:33.871	+

"	2003505	"To delete a local branch, you can use the command git branch -d branch_name. In your case, you can use the command git branch -d bugfix to delete the local branch.

To delete a remote branch, you need to use the command git push origin --delete branch_name. In your case, you can use the command git push origin --delete bugfix.

If you want to delete the remote branch and local branch in one command you can use this command git push origin --delete bugfix && git branch -d bugfix

It is important to note that when you delete a remote branch, it will only delete the branch on the remote repository and not on your local repository. To delete the local copy of the remote branch, you will need to run the local delete command after the remote delete command.

Also, when you delete a branch, it should not have any unmerged commits. If it has any unmerged commits, git will prevent deletion and you need to merge those commits or use -D instead of -d to delete the branch forcefully.

In your case, since you are trying to delete a remote branch, it seems that you are trying to delete the remote branch using the local branch name, the correct way to delete remote branch is by using the remote branch name and not local branch name, so it should be git push origin --delete remotes/origin/bugfix or simply git push origin --delete bugfix"				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37361170/00023a1612--63c9c47a6ab61412b422f603	00023a1612--63c96b36f603361fcb90d3f9	00023a1612--63c9c47a6ab61412b422f603	2a1461a0c1a0092f7fa2e769aec10171	APPROVED	2023-01-19T22:30:18.262	+	
"What are metaclasses in Python?
What are metaclasses? What are they used for?
"	100003	"In Python, a class is an object that defines the behavior and properties of other objects. A metaclass is a class that defines the behavior and properties of a class. In other words, a metaclass is the class of a class.

Metaclasses are used to create custom class behavior, such as adding methods or properties to all instances of a particular class or group of classes. They can also be used for advanced metaprogramming, such as creating new types of classes dynamically or modifying the behavior of the class creation process.

For example, you could use a metaclass to automatically add a method to all classes that inherit from a certain base class, or to create a singleton class that only allows one instance of the class to be created.

In python, The type is the default metaclass for all classes, and it is responsible for creating the class object and its behavior. However, you can define your own metaclasses by subclassing type and implementing custom behavior.

It's worth noting that metaclasses are considered an advanced feature of Python and are not commonly used in everyday programming. It is also considered as a somewhat complex topic and might not be needed in most cases."				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37361170/00023a1612--63c9c4e100c30a0e10ec6b4f	00023a1612--63c96b37f603361fcb90d47a	00023a1612--63c9c4e100c30a0e10ec6b4f	23de65e34db8fd81857e623b153d9415	APPROVED	2023-01-19T22:32:01.845	+

Both string and String are aliases for the System.String class. The string keyword is simply an alias for System.String that was introduced in C# for convenience and readability, so that you don't have to use the full namespace.

The System.String class is a built-in class in the .NET framework that provides a number of methods for manipulating strings, such as Substring, IndexOf, Replace, and more.

In terms of usage, it is common practice to use string keyword instead of System.String because it is shorter to type and more readable.

String s = ""Hello world!"";
Both lines will create a new string object with the value ""Hello world!"" and assigns it to the variable s.

"What is the difference between ""let"" and ""var""?
ECMAScript 6 introduced the let statement.
I've heard that it's described as a local variable, but I'm still not quite sure how it behaves differently than the var keyword.
What are the differences? When should let be used instead of var?
"	762011	"In JavaScript, let and var are used to declare variables. However, they have some key differences in how they behave.

The var keyword is used to declare a variable in JavaScript, and it is function scoped. This means that a variable declared with var is accessible within the entire function it was declared in, and it's hoisted to the top of the function.

The let keyword, introduced in ECMAScript 6, is also used to declare variables but it's block scoped. This means that a variable declared with let is accessible only within the block it was declared in, and it's not hoisted to the top of the block.

One of the most important difference between let and var is the temporal dead zone (TDZ). The variable declared with let inside a block cannot be accessed before it is declared. However, variables declared with var are accessible before they are declared, this is due to hoisting.

In terms of when to use let instead of var, it's generally recommended to use let when you need a variable that is only accessible within a specific block, such as within a loop or an if statement. This can help you avoid errors caused by accidentally accessing or modifying a variable from the wrong scope."				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37361170/00023a1612--63c9c5b9f603361fcb9e9e5a	00023a1612--63c96b37f603361fcb90d4ab	00023a1612--63c9c5b9f603361fcb9e9e5a	23de65e34db8fd81857e623b153d9415	APPROVED	2023-01-19T22:35:37.016	+

"What is the difference between px, dip, dp, and sp?
What is the difference between the units of measure
px, dip, dp, and sp?
"	2025282	"In Android development, there are several units of measure that can be used to specify the size and position of elements in a layout. The most commonly used units are:

px (pixels): This is the most basic unit of measure and represents a physical pixel on the device's screen. It is the default unit for specifying dimensions in Android.

dip (density-independent pixels): This unit of measure scales with the density of the device's screen. On a high-density screen, 1 dip is equal to 2 pixels, while on a low-density screen, 1 dip is equal to 1 pixel. Using dip units helps ensure that the layout of your app looks consistent across different screen densities.

dp (density-independent pixels): This unit of measure is equivalent to dip and it is an alias of it.

sp (scale-independent pixels): This unit of measure is similar to dip, but it is also scaled based on the user's preferred text size. It is used for specifying font sizes.

In short,

px is fixed and does not scale with the screen density.

"How is Docker different from a virtual machine?
I keep rereading the Docker documentation to try to understand the difference between Docker and a full VM. How does it manage to provide a full filesystem, isolated networking environment, etc. without being as heavy?
Why is deploying software to a Docker image (if that's the right term) easier than simply deploying to a consistent production environment?
"	16047306	"Docker and virtual machines (VMs) are both technologies that allow you to run software in an isolated environment, but they work in different ways.

A virtual machine is a software implementation of a physical machine that runs on top of a host operating system. Each VM runs its own operating system and has its own virtualized hardware, such as CPU, memory, and storage. This allows you to run multiple operating systems on the same physical machine, but it also makes VMs relatively heavy and resource-intensive.

Docker, on the other hand, is a containerization technology that allows you to package software and its dependencies into a single container. A container is a lightweight, standalone executable package that includes everything needed to run the software, including the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. Because containers share the host operating system kernel, they are much more lightweight and efficient than VMs.

When deploying software to a Docker image, it eliminates the ""works on my machine"" problem. It enables developers to package an application with all of its dependencies into a single container, which can run on any machine that has Docker installed. This makes it easier to deploy and run the same application in different environments, such as development, staging, and production, without worrying about compatibility issues.

In summary, Docker provides an isolated environment for running software that is lightweight and efficient, because it shares the host operating system kernel, while virtual machines provide complete isolation by running their own kernel and hardware virtualization."				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37361170/00023a1612--63c9c6750f3f3063a6911615	00023a1612--63c96b39f603361fcb90d573	00023a1612--63c9c6750f3f3063a6911615	23de65e34db8fd81857e623b153d9415	APPROVED	2023-01-19T22:38:45.709	+

I'm not sure what routines are available on all browsers, how ""random"" and seeded the built-in random number generator is, etc.
"	105034	"In JavaScript, you can use the crypto.getRandomValues() method to generate a cryptographically-secure random number, which you can then use to create a GUID/UUID. Here's an example of how you might generate a GUID:

Copy code
function generateGUID() {
  // Generate four random hex digits.
  function S4() {
    return (((1 + Math.random()) * 0x10000) | 0).toString(16).substring(1);

Note that this function generates a version 4 UUID, which is the most common type of UUID. It has the format xxxxxxxx-xxxx-4xxx-yxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx where x is any hexadecimal digit and y is one of 8, 9, A, or B.

It's important to note that while the Math.random() function is not cryptographically secure, it's sufficient for most use cases, and the usage of crypto.getRandomValues() would make it cryptographically secure.

You can also use libraries like uuid or node-uuid for generating UUIDs, which provide a more robust solution and are also cross-platform."				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37361170/00023a1612--63c9c67bf64dab1c8a7c91f5	00023a1612--63c96b38f603361fcb90d50e	00023a1612--63c9c67bf64dab1c8a7c91f5	2a1461a0c1a0092f7fa2e769aec10171	APPROVED	2023-01-19T22:38:51.448	+

"What is RESTful programming?
What exactly is RESTful programming?
"	671118	REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for building web services. RESTful programming is a way of designing and building web services that conform to the principles of REST. RESTful web services are typically built using HTTP and are based on the principles of resource-based design, in which resources are identified by URIs and manipulated using standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37361170/00023a1612--63c9c7acf64dab1c8a7caddb	00023a1612--63c96b39f603361fcb90d590	00023a1612--63c9c7acf64dab1c8a7caddb	eecfce578ec8f52e1db33743c0b80f7f	APPROVED	2023-01-19T22:43:56.719	+	
"What is the most efficient way to deep clone an object in JavaScript?
What is the most efficient way to clone a JavaScript object? I've seen obj = eval(uneval(o)); being used, but that's non-standard and only supported by Firefox. I've done things like obj = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(o)); but question the efficiency.  I've also seen recursive copying functions with various flaws.
I'm surprised no canonical solution exists.
"	122102	"There are several ways to deep clone an object in JavaScript, and the most efficient method depends on the specific use case and the size of the object being cloned.

One of the most efficient ways to deep clone an object is to use the Object.assign() method in combination with the spread operator (...). This method creates a new object and copies the properties and values of the original object to the new object. Here's an example:

Copy code
const originalObject = {a: 1, b: 2, c: {d: 3}};
const clonedObject = {...originalObject};
Another way is to use the JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj)) method, which converts the object to a JSON string, and then parses it back into a new object. This method is relatively fast and works well for small to medium-sized objects. However, it has some limitations. It does not work with functions, undefined, Symbol and some other object properties.

Copy code
const originalObject = {a: 1, b: 2, c: {d: 3}};
const clonedObject = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(originalObject));
A more complex but more versatile option is the use of a recursive copy function. This method is useful when you need to deep clone an object with a complex structure. You can also add some logic to handle certain types of properties like functions, undefined, Symbol and some other object properties

Copy code
function deepClone(obj) {
    if (obj === null || typeof obj !== 'object') {
        return obj;
    }
  
    let copy;
    if (Array.isArray(obj)) {
        copy = [];
        obj.forEach(item => copy.push(deepClone(item)));
    } else {
        copy = {};
        for (const key in obj) {
            copy[key] = deepClone(obj[key]);
        }
    }
  
    return copy;

"How do I resolve merge conflicts in a Git repository?
How do I resolve merge conflicts in my Git repository?
"	161813	"When merging branches in a Git repository, it's possible that there may be conflicts between the changes made in the different branches. These conflicts will need to be resolved before the merge can be completed. Here are the general steps to resolve merge conflicts in a Git repository:

Start the merge: Use the git merge command to start the merge process. If there are conflicts, Git will indicate which files have conflicts and will not complete the merge.

Open the conflicting files: Open the conflicting files in a text editor to see the specific changes that are causing the conflict. The conflicting changes will be marked with special markers, such as <<<<<<<, |||||||, and >>>>>>>.

Resolve the conflicts: Look at the conflicting changes and decide which changes should be kept and which should be discarded. You can use a visual merge tool to help with this process. Once you have made the necessary changes, save the files.

Commit the resolved conflicts: Once all the conflicts have been resolved, stage the resolved files using git add command, and then commit the changes using git commit.

Continue merging: Repeat the above steps until all conflicts have been resolved and the merge is complete."				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37361170/00023a1612--63c9c8396ed7565e0d087356	00023a1612--63c96b38f603361fcb90d4f3	00023a1612--63c9c8396ed7565e0d087356	23de65e34db8fd81857e623b153d9415	APPROVED	2023-01-19T22:46:17.157	+

"What is a plain English explanation of ""Big O"" notation?
I'd prefer as little formal definition as possible and simple mathematics.
"	487258	"Big O notation is a way to describe the performance of an algorithm or a program. It's a way to measure how well a program can scale as the amount of data it needs to process increases. The ""O"" stands for ""order"" or ""complexity"" and the number that follows it is a way to indicate how quickly the performance of the algorithm or program will degrade as the size of the input data increases.

For example, consider a program that needs to search for an element in an array. If the array is very small, it will take only a few milliseconds for the program to find the element. But if the array is very large, it might take much longer. The Big O notation is used to describe how quickly the program's performance will degrade as the size of the array increases.

There are a few common Big O notations that are used to describe the performance of an algorithm or program:

O(1) means that the program's performance will not degrade at all as the size of the input data increases. This is the best possible performance.
O(n) means that the program's performance will degrade linearly as the size of the input data increases. This is considered to be good performance.
O(n^2) means that the program's performance will degrade exponentially as the size of the input data increases. This is considered to be poor performance.
So, in simple terms, Big O notation is a way to measure how well a program can scale as the amount of data it needs to process increases. It's a way to compare the performance of different algorithms or programs, so you can choose the best one for a given task. O(1) is considered to be best, O(n) is considered to be good, and O(n^2) is considered to be poor.
