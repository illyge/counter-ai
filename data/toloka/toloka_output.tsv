"How do I undo the most recent local commits in Git?
I accidentally committed the wrong files to Git, but didn't push the commit to the server yet.
How do I undo those commits from the local repository?
"	927358	"You can use the git reset command to undo the most recent local commits in Git. The specific command you would use depends on how far back you want to reset the repository.

To undo the most recent commit, use the command:
git reset HEAD~
This will reset the repository to the state of the commit before the most recent one.

If you want to reset to a specific commit, you can use the commit's hash instead of HEAD~
git reset <commit_hash>
This will reset the repository to the state of the specific commit you specify.

Be careful with using the above command as it will remove all commits after the specified commit and make them unrecoverable.

Once you reset the repository, you can then recommit the files you want to keep."				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37361170/00023a1612--63c9c3f8e4ef243596e55dc7	00023a1612--63c96b36f603361fcb90d3f6	00023a1612--63c9c3f8e4ef243596e55dc7	823c2733aef57d9cc858a636c7965a64	APPROVED	2023-01-19T22:28:08.006	+	
"Which equals operator (== vs ===) should be used in JavaScript comparisons?
I'm using JSLint to go through JavaScript, and it's returning many suggestions to replace == (two equals signs) with === (three equals signs) when doing things like comparing idSele_UNVEHtype.value.length == 0 inside of an if statement.
Is there a performance benefit to replacing == with ===? 
Any performance improvement would be welcomed as many comparison operators exist.
If no type conversion takes place, would there be a performance gain over ==?
"	359494	"In JavaScript, it is generally recommended to use the ""strict equality"" operator (===) when comparing values, rather than the ""loose equality"" operator (==).
Using the strict equality operator will prevent unexpected type conversions from occurring.
For example, if you use the loose equality operator to compare the number 0 and the string ""0"", the comparison will return true, because JavaScript will automatically convert the string to a number before making the comparison.

Using === instead of == in JavaScript, it will not perform any type coercion and will only return true if the operands have the same type and the same value.

There may be some performance benefits to using the strict equality operator in certain cases, as it avoids the need for JavaScript to perform type conversions. However, in most cases the difference in performance is likely to be negligible.

So, it's a good practice to use === instead of == to avoid unexpected results, and in some cases it may also give a slight performance gain."				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37361170/00023a1612--63c9c44d0f3f3063a690d5ed	00023a1612--63c96b37f603361fcb90d4c7	00023a1612--63c9c44d0f3f3063a690d5ed	823c2733aef57d9cc858a636c7965a64	APPROVED	2023-01-19T22:29:33.871	+

"	2003505	"To delete a local branch, you can use the command git branch -d branch_name. In your case, you can use the command git branch -d bugfix to delete the local branch.

To delete a remote branch, you need to use the command git push origin --delete branch_name. In your case, you can use the command git push origin --delete bugfix.

If you want to delete the remote branch and local branch in one command you can use this command git push origin --delete bugfix && git branch -d bugfix

It is important to note that when you delete a remote branch, it will only delete the branch on the remote repository and not on your local repository. To delete the local copy of the remote branch, you will need to run the local delete command after the remote delete command.

Also, when you delete a branch, it should not have any unmerged commits. If it has any unmerged commits, git will prevent deletion and you need to merge those commits or use -D instead of -d to delete the branch forcefully.

In your case, since you are trying to delete a remote branch, it seems that you are trying to delete the remote branch using the local branch name, the correct way to delete remote branch is by using the remote branch name and not local branch name, so it should be git push origin --delete remotes/origin/bugfix or simply git push origin --delete bugfix"				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37361170/00023a1612--63c9c47a6ab61412b422f603	00023a1612--63c96b36f603361fcb90d3f9	00023a1612--63c9c47a6ab61412b422f603	2a1461a0c1a0092f7fa2e769aec10171	APPROVED	2023-01-19T22:30:18.262	+	
"What are metaclasses in Python?
What are metaclasses? What are they used for?
"	100003	"In Python, a class is an object that defines the behavior and properties of other objects. A metaclass is a class that defines the behavior and properties of a class. In other words, a metaclass is the class of a class.

Metaclasses are used to create custom class behavior, such as adding methods or properties to all instances of a particular class or group of classes. They can also be used for advanced metaprogramming, such as creating new types of classes dynamically or modifying the behavior of the class creation process.

For example, you could use a metaclass to automatically add a method to all classes that inherit from a certain base class, or to create a singleton class that only allows one instance of the class to be created.

In python, The type is the default metaclass for all classes, and it is responsible for creating the class object and its behavior. However, you can define your own metaclasses by subclassing type and implementing custom behavior.

It's worth noting that metaclasses are considered an advanced feature of Python and are not commonly used in everyday programming. It is also considered as a somewhat complex topic and might not be needed in most cases."				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37361170/00023a1612--63c9c4e100c30a0e10ec6b4f	00023a1612--63c96b37f603361fcb90d47a	00023a1612--63c9c4e100c30a0e10ec6b4f	23de65e34db8fd81857e623b153d9415	APPROVED	2023-01-19T22:32:01.845	+

Both string and String are aliases for the System.String class. The string keyword is simply an alias for System.String that was introduced in C# for convenience and readability, so that you don't have to use the full namespace.

The System.String class is a built-in class in the .NET framework that provides a number of methods for manipulating strings, such as Substring, IndexOf, Replace, and more.

In terms of usage, it is common practice to use string keyword instead of System.String because it is shorter to type and more readable.

String s = ""Hello world!"";
Both lines will create a new string object with the value ""Hello world!"" and assigns it to the variable s.

"What is the difference between ""let"" and ""var""?
ECMAScript 6 introduced the let statement.
I've heard that it's described as a local variable, but I'm still not quite sure how it behaves differently than the var keyword.
What are the differences? When should let be used instead of var?
"	762011	"In JavaScript, let and var are used to declare variables. However, they have some key differences in how they behave.

The var keyword is used to declare a variable in JavaScript, and it is function scoped. This means that a variable declared with var is accessible within the entire function it was declared in, and it's hoisted to the top of the function.

The let keyword, introduced in ECMAScript 6, is also used to declare variables but it's block scoped. This means that a variable declared with let is accessible only within the block it was declared in, and it's not hoisted to the top of the block.

One of the most important difference between let and var is the temporal dead zone (TDZ). The variable declared with let inside a block cannot be accessed before it is declared. However, variables declared with var are accessible before they are declared, this is due to hoisting.

In terms of when to use let instead of var, it's generally recommended to use let when you need a variable that is only accessible within a specific block, such as within a loop or an if statement. This can help you avoid errors caused by accidentally accessing or modifying a variable from the wrong scope."				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37361170/00023a1612--63c9c5b9f603361fcb9e9e5a	00023a1612--63c96b37f603361fcb90d4ab	00023a1612--63c9c5b9f603361fcb9e9e5a	23de65e34db8fd81857e623b153d9415	APPROVED	2023-01-19T22:35:37.016	+

"What is the difference between px, dip, dp, and sp?
What is the difference between the units of measure
px, dip, dp, and sp?
"	2025282	"In Android development, there are several units of measure that can be used to specify the size and position of elements in a layout. The most commonly used units are:

px (pixels): This is the most basic unit of measure and represents a physical pixel on the device's screen. It is the default unit for specifying dimensions in Android.

dip (density-independent pixels): This unit of measure scales with the density of the device's screen. On a high-density screen, 1 dip is equal to 2 pixels, while on a low-density screen, 1 dip is equal to 1 pixel. Using dip units helps ensure that the layout of your app looks consistent across different screen densities.

dp (density-independent pixels): This unit of measure is equivalent to dip and it is an alias of it.

sp (scale-independent pixels): This unit of measure is similar to dip, but it is also scaled based on the user's preferred text size. It is used for specifying font sizes.

In short,

px is fixed and does not scale with the screen density.

"How is Docker different from a virtual machine?
I keep rereading the Docker documentation to try to understand the difference between Docker and a full VM. How does it manage to provide a full filesystem, isolated networking environment, etc. without being as heavy?
Why is deploying software to a Docker image (if that's the right term) easier than simply deploying to a consistent production environment?
"	16047306	"Docker and virtual machines (VMs) are both technologies that allow you to run software in an isolated environment, but they work in different ways.

A virtual machine is a software implementation of a physical machine that runs on top of a host operating system. Each VM runs its own operating system and has its own virtualized hardware, such as CPU, memory, and storage. This allows you to run multiple operating systems on the same physical machine, but it also makes VMs relatively heavy and resource-intensive.

Docker, on the other hand, is a containerization technology that allows you to package software and its dependencies into a single container. A container is a lightweight, standalone executable package that includes everything needed to run the software, including the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. Because containers share the host operating system kernel, they are much more lightweight and efficient than VMs.

When deploying software to a Docker image, it eliminates the ""works on my machine"" problem. It enables developers to package an application with all of its dependencies into a single container, which can run on any machine that has Docker installed. This makes it easier to deploy and run the same application in different environments, such as development, staging, and production, without worrying about compatibility issues.

In summary, Docker provides an isolated environment for running software that is lightweight and efficient, because it shares the host operating system kernel, while virtual machines provide complete isolation by running their own kernel and hardware virtualization."				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37361170/00023a1612--63c9c6750f3f3063a6911615	00023a1612--63c96b39f603361fcb90d573	00023a1612--63c9c6750f3f3063a6911615	23de65e34db8fd81857e623b153d9415	APPROVED	2023-01-19T22:38:45.709	+

I'm not sure what routines are available on all browsers, how ""random"" and seeded the built-in random number generator is, etc.
"	105034	"In JavaScript, you can use the crypto.getRandomValues() method to generate a cryptographically-secure random number, which you can then use to create a GUID/UUID. Here's an example of how you might generate a GUID:

Copy code
function generateGUID() {
  // Generate four random hex digits.
  function S4() {
    return (((1 + Math.random()) * 0x10000) | 0).toString(16).substring(1);

Note that this function generates a version 4 UUID, which is the most common type of UUID. It has the format xxxxxxxx-xxxx-4xxx-yxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx where x is any hexadecimal digit and y is one of 8, 9, A, or B.

It's important to note that while the Math.random() function is not cryptographically secure, it's sufficient for most use cases, and the usage of crypto.getRandomValues() would make it cryptographically secure.

You can also use libraries like uuid or node-uuid for generating UUIDs, which provide a more robust solution and are also cross-platform."				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37361170/00023a1612--63c9c67bf64dab1c8a7c91f5	00023a1612--63c96b38f603361fcb90d50e	00023a1612--63c9c67bf64dab1c8a7c91f5	2a1461a0c1a0092f7fa2e769aec10171	APPROVED	2023-01-19T22:38:51.448	+

"What is RESTful programming?
What exactly is RESTful programming?
"	671118	REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for building web services. RESTful programming is a way of designing and building web services that conform to the principles of REST. RESTful web services are typically built using HTTP and are based on the principles of resource-based design, in which resources are identified by URIs and manipulated using standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37361170/00023a1612--63c9c7acf64dab1c8a7caddb	00023a1612--63c96b39f603361fcb90d590	00023a1612--63c9c7acf64dab1c8a7caddb	eecfce578ec8f52e1db33743c0b80f7f	APPROVED	2023-01-19T22:43:56.719	+	
"What is the most efficient way to deep clone an object in JavaScript?
What is the most efficient way to clone a JavaScript object? I've seen obj = eval(uneval(o)); being used, but that's non-standard and only supported by Firefox. I've done things like obj = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(o)); but question the efficiency.  I've also seen recursive copying functions with various flaws.
I'm surprised no canonical solution exists.
"	122102	"There are several ways to deep clone an object in JavaScript, and the most efficient method depends on the specific use case and the size of the object being cloned.

One of the most efficient ways to deep clone an object is to use the Object.assign() method in combination with the spread operator (...). This method creates a new object and copies the properties and values of the original object to the new object. Here's an example:

Copy code
const originalObject = {a: 1, b: 2, c: {d: 3}};
const clonedObject = {...originalObject};
Another way is to use the JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj)) method, which converts the object to a JSON string, and then parses it back into a new object. This method is relatively fast and works well for small to medium-sized objects. However, it has some limitations. It does not work with functions, undefined, Symbol and some other object properties.

Copy code
const originalObject = {a: 1, b: 2, c: {d: 3}};
const clonedObject = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(originalObject));
A more complex but more versatile option is the use of a recursive copy function. This method is useful when you need to deep clone an object with a complex structure. You can also add some logic to handle certain types of properties like functions, undefined, Symbol and some other object properties

Copy code
function deepClone(obj) {
    if (obj === null || typeof obj !== 'object') {
        return obj;
    }
  
    let copy;
    if (Array.isArray(obj)) {
        copy = [];
        obj.forEach(item => copy.push(deepClone(item)));
    } else {
        copy = {};
        for (const key in obj) {
            copy[key] = deepClone(obj[key]);
        }
    }
  
    return copy;

How do I resolve merge conflicts in my Git repository?
"	161813	"When merging branches in a Git repository, it's possible that there may be conflicts between the changes made in the different branches. These conflicts will need to be resolved before the merge can be completed. Here are the general steps to resolve merge conflicts in a Git repository:

Start the merge: Use the git merge command to start the merge process. If there are conflicts, Git will indicate which files have conflicts and will not complete the merge.

Open the conflicting files: Open the conflicting files in a text editor to see the specific changes that are causing the conflict. The conflicting changes will be marked with special markers, such as <<<<<<<, |||||||, and >>>>>>>.

Resolve the conflicts: Look at the conflicting changes and decide which changes should be kept and which should be discarded. You can use a visual merge tool to help with this process. Once you have made the necessary changes, save the files.

Commit the resolved conflicts: Once all the conflicts have been resolved, stage the resolved files using git add command, and then commit the changes using git commit.

Continue merging: Repeat the above steps until all conflicts have been resolved and the merge is complete."				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37361170/00023a1612--63c9c8396ed7565e0d087356	00023a1612--63c96b38f603361fcb90d4f3	00023a1612--63c9c8396ed7565e0d087356	23de65e34db8fd81857e623b153d9415	APPROVED	2023-01-19T22:46:17.157	+

"What is a plain English explanation of ""Big O"" notation?
I'd prefer as little formal definition as possible and simple mathematics.
"	487258	"Big O notation is a way to describe the performance of an algorithm or a program. It's a way to measure how well a program can scale as the amount of data it needs to process increases. The ""O"" stands for ""order"" or ""complexity"" and the number that follows it is a way to indicate how quickly the performance of the algorithm or program will degrade as the size of the input data increases.

For example, consider a program that needs to search for an element in an array. If the array is very small, it will take only a few milliseconds for the program to find the element. But if the array is very large, it might take much longer. The Big O notation is used to describe how quickly the program's performance will degrade as the size of the array increases.

There are a few common Big O notations that are used to describe the performance of an algorithm or program:

O(1) means that the program's performance will not degrade at all as the size of the input data increases. This is the best possible performance.
O(n) means that the program's performance will degrade linearly as the size of the input data increases. This is considered to be good performance.
O(n^2) means that the program's performance will degrade exponentially as the size of the input data increases. This is considered to be poor performance.
So, in simple terms, Big O notation is a way to measure how well a program can scale as the amount of data it needs to process increases. It's a way to compare the performance of different algorithms or programs, so you can choose the best one for a given task. O(1) is considered to be best, O(n) is considered to be good, and O(n^2) is considered to be poor.

What is the difference between __str__ and __repr__ in Python?
"	1436703	"In Python, __str__ and __repr__ are both dunder methods used to define human-readable and unambiguous string representations of an object, respectively.

__str__ is meant to return a string that provides a concise, user-friendly representation of an object. The output of __str__ is usually intended for display to end-users, while still being informative enough to give an idea of what the object represents.

__repr__, on the other hand, is intended to provide a unambiguous, complete representation of an object. This representation should be formatted as a string and should ideally be usable as code to recreate the object if passed to eval(). The output of __repr__ is intended for debugging and development purposes.

In summary, __str__ is for a friendly, readable representation and __repr__ is for a unambiguous, complete representation."	eu.386cb341-33ac-4380-acbc-bc7d146ac7c5				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de377e1293785987a7e0e0	00023da2e8--63de23642ff0b42c197a2aca	00023da2e8--63de377e1293785987a7e0e0	420edf6930f74d245330296489f788e8	APPROVED	2023-02-04T10:46:22.276	+

"C++11 introduced a standardized memory model. What does it mean? And how is it going to affect C++ programming?
C++11 introduced a standardized memory model, but what exactly does that mean? And how is it going to affect C++ programming?
This article (by Gavin Clarke who quotes Herb Sutter) says that,
The memory model means that C++ code
now has a standardized library to call
regardless of who made the compiler
and on what platform it's running.
There's a standard way to control how
different threads talk to the
processor's memory.
""When you are talking about splitting
[code] across different cores that's
in the standard, we are talking about
the memory model. We are going to
optimize it without breaking the
following assumptions people are going
to make in the code,"" Sutter said.
Well, I can memorize this and similar paragraphs available online (as I've had my own memory model since birth :P) and can even post as an answer to questions asked by others, but to be honest, I don't exactly understand this.
C++ programmers used to develop multi-threaded applications even before, so how does it matter if it's POSIX threads, or Windows threads, or C++11 threads? What are the benefits? I want to understand the low-level details.
I also get this feeling that the C++11 memory model is somehow related to C++11 multi-threading support, as I often see these two together. If it is, how exactly? Why should they be related?
I don't know how the internals of multi-threading work, and what memory model means in general.
"	6319146	"The C++11 Standardized Memory Model specifies the rules for accessing and modifying the shared data in concurrent programs. It defines how the different threads in a program interact with memory and the order in which memory accesses by different threads should become visible to each other. This is important for ensuring the consistency and predictability of program behavior in multithreaded environments.

The introduction of the standardized memory model in C++11 will affect C++ programming by providing a clear and well-defined framework for writing concurrent programs in C++. This will lead to more consistent and predictable behavior across different platforms and make it easier to write programs that can take advantage of multiple cores and processors. Additionally, it will make it easier to write concurrent code that is portable across different systems and platforms."	eu.5cb84d29-f2e4-4dfc-93b2-88dd0e33994a				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de3970bf8cf9761109d9b2	00023da2e8--63de236e2ff0b42c197a2ed4	00023da2e8--63de3970bf8cf9761109d9b2	e94a0e4a9bc57c10ae8b01b0d910b306	APPROVED	2023-02-04T10:54:40.741	+

How do I convert a string to a byte[] in .NET (C#) without manually specifying a specific encoding?
I'm going to encrypt the string. I can encrypt it without converting, but I'd still like to know why encoding comes to play here.
Also, why should encoding even be taken into consideration? Can't I simply get what bytes the string has been stored in? Why is there a dependency on character encodings?
"	472906	"In .NET, strings are encoded as UTF-16, which means each character in a string is represented by two bytes. When you convert a string to a byte array, you need to specify an encoding to determine how the string should be translated into a byte representation. The choice of encoding can affect the resulting byte array, because different encodings may map the same string to different sequences of bytes.

For example, if you convert a string to a byte array using the UTF-8 encoding, the resulting byte array will be different than if you use the UTF-16 encoding.

When encrypting a string, you should use a consistent encoding to ensure that the same string is always translated to the same sequence of bytes, so that you can properly encrypt and decrypt it. If you don't specify an encoding, .NET will use the default encoding for your system, which may not be what you expect.

It's not possible to simply get the bytes that the string has been stored in, because a string is a higher-level object that is abstracted from the underlying representation of its characters in memory. To convert a string to a byte array, you need to translate the string into a specific representation, such as UTF-8 or UTF-16, using an encoding."	eu.0e05b549-ae86-4ec8-a45b-d2456654c867				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de3a086adb8b18a528516b	00023da2e8--63de236c2ff0b42c197a2dc8	00023da2e8--63de3a086adb8b18a528516b	3588b7726e48388a2b8a3e76f71466fc	APPROVED	2023-02-04T10:57:12.371	+

"What is the optimal algorithm for the game 2048?
I have recently stumbled upon the game 2048. You merge similar tiles by moving them in any of the four directions to make ""bigger"" tiles. After each move, a new tile appears at random empty position with a value of either 2 or 4. The game terminates when all the boxes are filled and there are no moves that can merge tiles, or you create a tile with a value of 2048.
One, I need to follow a well-defined strategy to reach the goal. So, I thought of writing a program for it.
My current algorithm:
while (!game_over) {
    for each possible move:
        count_no_of_merges_for_2-tiles and 4-tiles
    choose the move with a large number of merges
}
What I am doing is at any point, I will try to merge the tiles with values 2 and 4, that is, I try to have 2 and 4 tiles, as minimum as possible. If I try it this way, all other tiles were automatically getting merged and the strategy seems good.
But, when I actually use this algorithm, I only get around 4000 points before the game terminates. Maximum points AFAIK is slightly more than 20,000 points which is way larger than my current score. Is there a better algorithm than the above?
"	22342854	"Your current algorithm is a basic greedy approach, which only focuses on merging 2 and 4 tiles, but it doesn't consider other factors such as tile placement and maximizing the number of empty tiles.

A better approach is to use a Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. The algorithm simulates all possible moves and evaluates the best move by assigning scores to each possible game state. The score is calculated based on several factors such as tile placement, number of empty tiles, and the sum of tile values.

There are also more sophisticated algorithms such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), which can be used to find the optimal strategy. MCTS is a powerful algorithm that has been used to solve complex games such as chess and Go. However, it can be computationally intensive, so you may need to implement it carefully to ensure it runs efficiently for 2048."	eu.36c9c2eb-7eaf-4f08-8f89-acb6adccbb93				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de3caa8820411c59c712d5	00023da2e8--63de236f2ff0b42c197a2f55	00023da2e8--63de3caa8820411c59c712d5	eecfce578ec8f52e1db33743c0b80f7f	APPROVED	2023-02-04T11:08:26.922	+

"Difference between decimal, float and double in .NET?
What is the difference between decimal, float and double in .NET?
When would someone use one of these?
"	618535	"In .NET, decimal, float, and double are data types used to represent numeric values with varying levels of precision and range.

decimal: It is a high-precision floating-point data type with 28-29 significant digits of precision. It is used when precision is required, such as in financial calculations.

float: It is a single-precision floating-point data type with 7 significant digits of precision. It has a smaller range and precision than decimal but is faster for floating-point operations.

double: It is a double-precision floating-point data type with 15-16 significant digits of precision. It has a larger range and precision than float but is slower for floating-point operations.

In general, you would choose decimal for financial calculations that require high precision, float for single-precision floating-point operations, and double for double-precision floating-point operations"	eu.6e59e776-f604-40fd-97e8-2f92f3f4d388				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de3df7d7780d1c2015e2f9	00023da2e8--63de236b2ff0b42c197a2dae	00023da2e8--63de3df7d7780d1c2015e2f9	3588b7726e48388a2b8a3e76f71466fc	APPROVED	2023-02-04T11:13:59.931	+

"How to decide when to use Node.js?
I am new to this kind of stuff, but lately I've been hearing a lot about how good Node.js is. Considering how much I love working with jQuery and JavaScript in general, I can't help but wonder how to decide when to use Node.js. The web application I have in mind is something like Bitly - takes some content, archives it. 
From all the homework I have been doing in the last few days, I obtained the following information. Node.js 
is a command-line tool that can be run as a regular web server and lets one run JavaScript programs
utilizes the great V8 JavaScript engine
is very good when you need to do several things at the same time
is event-based so all the wonderful Ajax-like stuff can be done on the server side
lets us share code between the browser and the backend
lets us talk with MySQL
Some of the sources that I have come across are:
Diving into Node.js – Introduction and Installation
Understanding NodeJS
Node by Example (Archive.is)
Let’s Make a Web App: NodePad
Considering that Node.js can be run almost out-of-the-box on Amazon's EC2 instances, I am trying to understand what type of problems require Node.js as opposed to any of the mighty kings out there like PHP, Python and Ruby. I understand that it really depends on the expertise one has on a language, but my question falls more into the general category of: When to use a particular framework and what type of problems is it particularly suited for?

Web applications with real-time updates (e.g. chat applications)
Streaming data-intensive services (e.g. video and audio streaming)
RESTful APIs
Command-line tools and utilities
It's important to note that Node.js is not the best choice for every type of application. For example, it may not be the best choice for CPU-intensive applications or applications with complex server-side logic. In general, it's best to use Node.js when you need a fast and efficient solution for building network applications, and when you are comfortable with JavaScript."	eu.74fb3e20-d8fd-46b6-8934-fc09918cdfe8				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de3e08aff36b55e4ce1e20	00023da2e8--63de236d2ff0b42c197a2e83	00023da2e8--63de3e08aff36b55e4ce1e20	420edf6930f74d245330296489f788e8	APPROVED	2023-02-04T11:14:16.317	+

"Java inner class and static nested class
What is the main difference between an inner class and a static nested class in Java? Does design / implementation play a role in choosing one of these?
"	70324	"In Java, the main difference between an inner class and a static nested class is the way they are associated with the enclosing class.

An inner class is a non-static nested class that has access to the instance variables and methods of its enclosing class. It can be declared within the body of the enclosing class and is often used as a way to logically group classes that are only used in the context of the enclosing class.

A static nested class is a nested class that is declared with the static keyword. Unlike an inner class, it does not have access to the instance variables and methods of its enclosing class. It can be used as a regular class and is often used as a way to logically group related classes.

Design and implementation do play a role in choosing between an inner class and a static nested class. The choice between the two often depends on how tightly the class is coupled to the enclosing class. If the class is tightly coupled and needs access to the instance variables and methods of the enclosing class, an inner class may be the best choice. If the class is more loosely coupled and does not need access to the enclosing class, a static nested class may be a better choice."	eu.9ae13070-6e40-4266-b4b7-8f1b1c12c1a2				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de3e50c819b6546da843c0	00023da2e8--63de23702ff0b42c197a2f8e	00023da2e8--63de3e50c819b6546da843c0	420edf6930f74d245330296489f788e8	APPROVED	2023-02-04T11:15:28.439	+

"How does database indexing work?
Given that indexing is so important as your data set increases in size, can someone explain how indexing works at a database-agnostic level?
For information on queries to index a field, check out How do I index a database column.
"	1108	"Indexing in databases is a technique that allows for faster data retrieval operations on a database table by creating a separate data structure (the index) that stores a mapping of values in the indexed columns to their corresponding rows in the table. When a query is executed, the database first looks in the index rather than scanning the entire table, reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed.

The basic idea behind indexing is to provide a search tree-like data structure that allows for efficient searching of the data. The most common index structure used in databases is the B-Tree, which provides logarithmic time complexity for most operations. Other index structures such as Hash Tables or Tries can also be used depending on the use case.

When a new record is inserted or an existing record is updated, the index must also be updated to reflect the changes in the underlying data. The cost of maintaining the index needs to be balanced against the benefits of faster query performance.

In summary, indexing in databases is a technique used to increase the performance of data retrieval operations by creating a separate data structure that maps values in the indexed columns to their corresponding rows in the table. This allows the database to search the data more efficiently, reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed."	eu.24388116-fc27-4ced-b52e-28ea0a03624d				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de3f1a2ff0b42c197fddd4	00023da2e8--63de23682ff0b42c197a2c22	00023da2e8--63de3f1a2ff0b42c197fddd4	420edf6930f74d245330296489f788e8	APPROVED	2023-02-04T11:18:50.886	+

"	592620	"In Bash, you can check if a program exists by using the command command with the -v option.

For example:

bash

if command -v program_name > /dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo ""program_name found, continuing with script""
else
  echo ""program_name not found, exiting script""
  exit 1
fi
In this example, command -v program_name returns the path to the program if it exists in the PATH, and returns a non-zero exit status otherwise. The output of the command is redirected to /dev/null so it won't be displayed. The 2>&1 redirects stderr to stdout, which is redirected to /dev/null, so that any error messages produced by the command command are suppressed."	eu.3350c896-191e-4b44-ab1b-9a6c9ef83782				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de3fab6adb8b18a52951e2	00023da2e8--63de23672ff0b42c197a2bdf	00023da2e8--63de3fab6adb8b18a52951e2	420edf6930f74d245330296489f788e8	APPROVED	2023-02-04T11:21:15.397	+	
"How to lazy load images in ListView in Android
I am using a ListView to display some images and captions associated with those images. I am getting the images from the Internet. Is there a way to lazy load images so while the text displays, the UI is not blocked and images are displayed as they are downloaded? 
The total number of images is not fixed.
"	541966	"Lazy loading of images in a ListView in Android can be achieved by using an image loading library like Picasso or Glide. These libraries allow you to load images asynchronously in the background, so that your UI does not freeze while the images are being downloaded. Here's an example using Picasso:

    Add Picasso to your gradle dependencies:

python

implementation 'com.squareup.picasso:picasso:2.71828'

    In your custom adapter class, load images using Picasso in the getView method:

java

@Override
public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) {
    // Your existing code to inflate the view and set the text
    
    ImageView imageView = (ImageView) convertView.findViewById(R.id.image_view);
    Picasso.get().load(""http://i.imgur.com/DvpvklR.png"").into(imageView);
    
    return convertView;
}

This code will load the image from the URL asynchronously in the background, and display it in the ImageView once it has finished downloading."	eu.a34d463c-33c7-48e3-8ca6-8b77402de78a				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de3fca2ff0b42c197fff38	00023da2e8--63de236f2ff0b42c197a2f49	00023da2e8--63de3fca2ff0b42c197fff38	eecfce578ec8f52e1db33743c0b80f7f	APPROVED	2023-02-04T11:21:46.818	+

"	588866	"In Objective-C, ""atomic"" and ""nonatomic"" are used as attributes in the property declarations of a class to control the behavior of the generated accessor methods for the property.

""atomic"" properties guarantee that access to the property value is thread-safe and will not result in data corruption by ensuring that access to the property value is done in a way that prevents multiple threads from simultaneously reading or writing to it.
""nonatomic"" properties, on the other hand, do not make any guarantees about thread safety, and multiple threads may access the property value simultaneously, potentially resulting in data corruption.
When ""atomic"" is not specified, the default behavior is ""atomic"".

So, in your examples:

""@property(nonatomic, retain) UITextField *userName;"" creates a ""nonatomic"" property.

    gprof: A standard Unix tool for profiling code that reports function-level information about how much time was spent in each function and how many times it was called.

    perf: A Linux performance analysis tool that provides performance metrics for hardware events such as CPU cycles and cache misses, as well as software events such as context switches and page faults.

    Valgrind: A dynamic analysis tool that can be used to find memory leaks, invalid memory accesses, and other problems in C++ programs.

    Callgrind: A tool that is part of the Valgrind suite that provides function-level information about how many times each function was called, how much time was spent in each function, and how many cache misses were incurred.

    gdb: A debugger that can be used to monitor the execution of a program and to identify the source of performance problems.

    Visual Studio Code: A popular open-source code editor that has a C++ profiling tool.

You can use these tools to identify performance bottlenecks in your code, such as functions that are taking too much time to execute, or areas of the code where you are using too much memory."	eu.9082f29a-f337-417c-befb-d670cd20039c				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de41dac934756c0b06c42b	00023da2e8--63de236e2ff0b42c197a2f1e	00023da2e8--63de41dac934756c0b06c42b	eecfce578ec8f52e1db33743c0b80f7f	APPROVED	2023-02-04T11:30:34.054	+

Remove duplicate values from JS array
Similar question:
Get all non-unique values (i.e.: duplicate/more than one occurrence) in an array
"	1960473	"The code you have posted uses an object-based approach to remove duplicates from an array. This approach works by adding each element in the array as a property of an object, which can only have unique properties. However, when an element is 0, this approach will not work as expected.

The reason is that when you add a property with a value of 0 to an object, it will be converted to a string and become ""0"", which is different from the original number 0. Therefore, when the second loop iterates over the properties of the object, it will include ""0"" in the result array, instead of 0.

To fix this, you can use the following code:

css

Array.prototype.getUnique = function() {
  var o = {}, a = [], i, e;
  for (i = 0; e = this[i]; i++) {
    o[e] = 1;
  }
  for (e in o) {
    a.push(+e);
  }
  return a;
};

Here, we use the unary plus operator (+) to convert the property back to a number before pushing it into the result array.

"Why is char[] preferred over String for passwords?
In Swing, the password field has a getPassword() (returns char[]) method instead of the usual getText() (returns String) method. Similarly, I have come across a suggestion not to use String to handle passwords.
Why does String pose a threat to security when it comes to passwords?
It feels inconvenient to use char[].
"	8881291	"Strings are immutable in Java and once created, they cannot be changed. This means that when you perform operations on a String, it creates a new String object in memory, while the original one remains unchanged. If a password is stored in a String, it remains in memory until garbage collection reclaims the memory. This increases the risk of the password being exposed, as it can be accessed by an attacker who gains access to the memory dump.

On the other hand, char arrays can be easily wiped out of memory after use, which makes them a safer option for storing passwords. The getPassword() method returns a char array, allowing the password to be cleared from memory after use, reducing the risk of exposure.

While using char[] might feel inconvenient, it is a recommended security measure to protect sensitive information like passwords."	eu.c44c3cb5-914b-4593-bc3a-8c22925e9d38				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de4448dc927a3420c9cbb2	00023da2e8--63de23642ff0b42c197a2a7a	00023da2e8--63de4448dc927a3420c9cbb2	420edf6930f74d245330296489f788e8	APPROVED	2023-02-04T11:40:56.908	+	
"Using global variables in a function
How do I create or use a global variable inside a function?
How do I use a global variable that was defined in one function inside other functions?
Failing to use the global keyword where appropriate often causes UnboundLocalError. The precise rules for this are explained at UnboundLocalError on local variable when reassigned after first use. Generally, please close other questions as a duplicate of that question when an explanation is sought, and this question when someone simply needs to know the global keyword.
"	423379	"To use a global variable inside a function, you need to use the ""global"" keyword before the variable. This tells Python that the variable is a global variable and can be used across different functions. Here's an example:

python

# Define a global variable
x = 10

def my_function():
    global x
    x += 1
    print(x)

# Call the function
my_function() # Output: 11

# The global variable has been changed by the function
print(x) # Output: 11

To use a global variable that was defined in one function inside other functions, you need to use the ""global"" keyword in each function that wants to access the global variable:

python

# Define a global variable
x = 10

def first_function():
    global x
    x += 1

def second_function():
    global x
    x += 2

# Call both functions

second_function()

"How does data binding work in AngularJS?
How does data binding work in the AngularJS framework?
I haven't found technical details on their site. It's more or less clear how it works when data is propagated from view to model. But how does AngularJS track changes of model properties without setters and getters?
I found that there are JavaScript watchers that may do this work. But they are not supported in Internet Explorer 6 and Internet Explorer 7. So how does AngularJS know that I changed for example the following and reflected this change on a view?
myobject.myproperty=""new value"";
"	9682092	"In AngularJS, data binding is achieved through a combination of dirty checking and digest cycles. When a model property is changed, AngularJS adds the property to a ""dirty"" checking list and runs a digest cycle to see if any changes have been made. The digest cycle runs until all model properties have stabilized and there are no more changes to be made. This process is repeated continuously to ensure that the view and model are always in sync.

AngularJS uses JavaScript getters and setters to track changes to model properties. In modern browsers, these getters and setters are automatically generated for object properties, but in older browsers such as Internet Explorer 6 and 7, AngularJS uses a fallback method based on AngularJS' own implementation of getters and setters, known as ""accessors."" These accessors are not subject to the same limitations as the native getters and setters, and thus AngularJS can continue to track changes to model properties even in older browsers."	eu.cd10a28c-a5dc-43d3-8fdf-99f64087efb9				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de4496405a38476b4dc3f7	00023da2e8--63de23702ff0b42c197a2f8c	00023da2e8--63de4496405a38476b4dc3f7	e94a0e4a9bc57c10ae8b01b0d910b306	APPROVED	2023-02-04T11:42:14.213	+

"Detecting an ""invalid date"" Date instance in JavaScript
I'd like to tell the difference between valid and invalid date objects in JS, but couldn't figure out how:
var d = new Date(""foo"");
console.log(d.toString()); // shows 'Invalid Date'
console.log(typeof d); // shows 'object'
console.log(d instanceof Date); // shows 'true'
Any ideas for writing an isValidDate function?
Ash recommended Date.parse for parsing date strings, which gives an authoritative way to check if the date string is valid.
What I would prefer, if possible, is have my API accept a Date instance and to be able to check/assert whether it's valid or not. Borgar's solution does that, but I need to test it across browsers. I also wonder whether there's a more elegant way.
Ash made me consider not having my API accept Date instances at all, this would be easiest to validate.
Borgar suggested testing for a Date instance, and then testing for the Date's time value. If the date is invalid, the time value is NaN. I checked with ECMA-262 and this behavior is in the standard, which is exactly what I'm looking for.
"	1353684	"The most elegant way to check if a Date object is valid in JavaScript is by checking its time value, which is represented as a numeric value. An invalid date object in JavaScript has a time value of NaN (Not-A-Number).

"Why can templates only be implemented in the header file?
Quote from The C++ standard library: a tutorial and handbook:
  The only portable way of using templates at the moment is to implement them in header files by using inline functions.
Why is this?
(Clarification: header files are not the only portable solution. But they are the most convenient portable solution.)
"	495021	The reason templates are typically implemented in header files is because they are compiled as part of the program that uses them, not as a separate object file like normal functions. The implementation of the template must be visible to the compiler at the point of instantiation, which occurs in the source file that uses the template. By including the implementation in a header file and including the header file in the source file, the compiler has access to the implementation at the point of instantiation. This makes it possible to instantiate the template for different types, generating different versions of the same code.	eu.088cd3ee-5070-45c7-823e-3dfc110e93bb				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de45c1461aef4decd4fbfa	00023da2e8--63de236d2ff0b42c197a2e9a	00023da2e8--63de45c1461aef4decd4fbfa	e94a0e4a9bc57c10ae8b01b0d910b306	APPROVED	2023-02-04T11:47:13.508	+

"Deep cloning objects
I want to do something like:

MyObject newObj = myObj.Clone();
And then make changes to the new object that are not reflected in the original object.
I don't often need this functionality, so when it's been necessary, I've resorted to creating a new object and then copying each property individually, but it always leaves me with the feeling that there is a better or more elegant way of handling the situation.
How can I clone or deep copy an object so that the cloned object can be modified without any changes being reflected in the original object?
"	78536	"To deep clone an object in C#, you can use the System.Object.MemberwiseClone() method, which creates a shallow copy of the object. However, this method only creates a shallow copy, meaning that any reference type fields will still refer to the same object instances as the original object.

To create a true deep copy, you can implement a custom deep clone method by manually copying each field, including reference type fields, to a new object. Alternatively, you can use a serialization technique, such as BinaryFormatter or JsonSerializer, to serialize the original object to a memory stream, and then deserialize the memory stream to a new object, effectively creating a deep copy.

"Why is ""1000000000000000 in range(1000000000000001)"" so fast in Python 3?
It is my understanding that the range() function, which is actually an object type in Python 3, generates its contents on the fly, similar to a generator.
This being the case, I would have expected the following line to take an inordinate amount of time because, in order to determine whether 1 quadrillion is in the range, a quadrillion values would have to be generated:
1_000_000_000_000_000 in range(1_000_000_000_000_001)
Furthermore: it seems that no matter how many zeroes I add on, the calculation more or less takes the same amount of time (basically instantaneous).
I have also tried things like this, but the calculation is still almost instant:
# count by tens
1_000_000_000_000_000_000_000 in range(0,1_000_000_000_000_000_000_001,10)
If I try to implement my own range function, the result is not so nice!
def my_crappy_range(N):
    i = 0
    while i < N:
        yield i
        i += 1
    return
What is the range() object doing under the hood that makes it so fast?
Martijn Pieters's answer was chosen for its completeness, but also see abarnert's first answer for a good discussion of what it means for range to be a full-fledged sequence in Python 3, and some information/warning regarding potential inconsistency for __contains__ function optimization across Python implementations. abarnert's other answer goes into some more detail and provides links for those interested in the history behind the optimization in Python 3 (and lack of optimization of xrange in Python 2). Answers by poke and by wim provide the relevant C source code and explanations for those who are interested.
"	30081275	"In Python 3, the range function is optimized and implemented as an object of range type, which is a full-fledged sequence that implements an efficient __contains__ method. This method uses a binary search algorithm to check if a value is in the range, making it much faster than generating all the values in the range and checking one by one. The optimization makes the in operator with a range object very fast, even for large ranges. The behavior of the range object in Python 3 is not consistent across Python implementations, and the optimization may not be present in all implementations.

Huh? What call? That doesn't make any sense to me. JSON is a data format. There's no call.

Addendum: I've just created a new page for JSONP on Wikipedia; it now has a clear and thorough description of JSONP, based on jvenema's answer.
"	2067472	"JSONP (JSON with Padding) is a technique for overcoming the same-origin policy limitations of web browsers, which prevent a web page from making requests to a different domain than the one the web page originated from.

JSONP works by wrapping the JSON data in a function call, and then returning the data to the web page as a script file. The web page specifies the function name to be called in the URL of the JSONP request. When the server returns the JSON data wrapped in the specified function, the browser executes the function and passes the JSON data as an argument.

JSONP was created as a workaround to allow communication between domains, when the same-origin policy was preventing regular AJAX (XMLHttpRequest) requests. JSONP was widely used in the early days of the web, before the introduction of CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing), which provides a standard way for a web page to make requests to a different domain.

You would use JSONP in situations where you need to make a request to a server in a different domain, and CORS is not supported or is not a suitable solution. JSONP can be a simple and effective solution, but it has some limitations and security concerns, so it's not always the best choice.

When a single-argument constructor is declared explicit, it cannot be used to perform implicit conversions. For example, consider the following code:

"What are drawbacks or disadvantages of singleton pattern?
The singleton pattern is a fully paid up member of the GoF's patterns book, but it lately seems rather orphaned by the developer world. I still use quite a lot of singletons, especially for factory classes, and while you have to be a bit careful about multithreading issues (like any class actually), I fail to see why they are so awful.
Stack Overflow especially seems to assume that everyone agrees that Singletons are evil. Why?
Please support your answers with ""facts, references, or specific expertise""
"	137975	"There are several drawbacks or disadvantages of using the singleton pattern:

    Global State: Singletons introduce global state into your application, making it harder to reason about the flow of data and state changes. This can lead to tight coupling between objects, making it harder to maintain and test your code.

    Testing difficulties: Singletons can be difficult to test, as they are tightly coupled to the rest of the application and cannot be easily substituted with mock objects. This can lead to slow, difficult-to-maintain test suites.

    Dependency Injection: Singletons can be seen as an anti-pattern when used in conjunction with dependency injection, as they undermine the entire purpose of dependency injection, which is to achieve loose coupling between objects.

    Tight coupling: Singletons can lead to tight coupling between objects, making it harder to maintain and test your code.

    Hard to subclass: Singletons can be difficult to subclass, as they often have complex, global state that cannot be easily changed or extended.

These are some of the main criticisms of the singleton pattern. However, it's worth noting that, like any design pattern, singletons have their place in certain situations, such as when a single instance of a class is required to coordinate actions across the system. The key is to be mindful of their limitations and use them appropriately.

As for the clear rules on when to use each access modifier, it is generally a matter of design choice based on the desired level of encapsulation and abstraction.

"How does JavaScript .prototype work?
I'm not that into dynamic programming languages but I've written my fair share of JavaScript code. I never really got my head around this prototype-based programming, does any one know how this works?
var obj = new Object();
obj.prototype.test = function() { alert('Hello?'); };
var obj2 = new obj();
obj2.test();
I remember a lot discussion I had with people a while back (I'm not exactly sure what I'm doing) but as I understand it, there's no concept of a class. It's just an object, and instances of those objects are clones of the original, right?
But what is the exact purpose of this "".prototype"" property in JavaScript? How does it relate to instantiating objects?
Update: correct way
var obj = new Object(); // not a functional object
obj.prototype.test = function() { alert('Hello?'); }; // this is wrong!
function MyObject() {} // a first class functional object
MyObject.prototype.test = function() { alert('OK'); } // OK
Also these slides really helped a lot.
"	572897	"JavaScript uses prototype-based programming, which is different from class-based programming in languages like Java or C#. In JavaScript, there is no concept of classes, only objects. When you create an object, it has an internal property called prototype, which is a reference to another object.

The prototype property is used to share properties and methods between objects. If you try to access a property or a method on an object and it can't be found, JavaScript will look for it on the object's prototype. This is called prototype chaining, and it is how inheritance is implemented in JavaScript.

In the code example you provided, obj is an instance of the built-in Object object. However, you cannot add properties to obj.prototype directly because obj is not a function object. Functions are used to create objects in JavaScript, and they have their own prototype property.

The correct way to add properties to the prototype of a custom object type is to create a function object and add properties to its prototype property. In the updated code example, you created a function MyObject and added a test method to its prototype property. This way, when you create an instance of MyObject using var obj2 = new MyObject(), it will have access to the test method via prototype chaining."	eu.8a452c88-31c4-45df-ab0a-b2dba7a949c3				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de54bfdc927a3420cc9c97	00023da2e8--63de236e2ff0b42c197a2eab	00023da2e8--63de54bfdc927a3420cc9c97	286ce83192d264c83604997426952e82	APPROVED	2023-02-04T12:51:11.157	+

This status is similar to 401 (Unauthorized), but indicates that authentication will not help. A 403 response is not a guarantee that the client will not be able to access the requested resource; it simply means that the server will not provide the requested information.

401 Unauthorized is used to indicate that authentication is required and has failed or has not been provided.

"NPM vs. Bower vs. Browserify vs. Gulp vs. Grunt vs. Webpack
I'm trying to summarize my knowledge about the most popular JavaScript package managers, bundlers, and task runners. Please correct me if I'm wrong:
npm & bower are package managers. They just download the dependencies and don't know how to build projects on their own. What they know is to call webpack/gulp/grunt after fetching all the dependencies.
bower is like npm, but builds a flattened dependency trees (unlike npm which does it recursively). Meaning npm fetches the dependencies for each dependency (may fetch the same a few times), while bower expects you to manually include sub-dependencies. Sometimes bower and npm are used together for front-end and back-end respectively (since each megabyte might matter in front-end).
grunt and gulp are task runners to automate everything that can be automated (i.e. compile CSS/Sass, optimize images, make a bundle and minify/transpile it).
grunt vs. gulp (is like maven vs. gradle or configuration vs. code). Grunt is based on configuring separate independent tasks, each task opens/handles/closes file. Gulp requires less amount of code and is based on Node streams, which allows it to build pipe chains (w/o reopening the same file) and makes it faster. 
webpack (webpack-dev-server) - for me it's a task runner with hot reloading of changes which allows you to forget about all JS/CSS watchers. 
npm/bower + plugins may replace task runners. Their abilities often intersect so there are different implications if you need to use gulp/grunt over npm + plugins. But task runners are definitely better for complex tasks (e.g. ""on each build create bundle, transpile from ES6 to ES5, run it at all browsers emulators, make screenshots and deploy to dropbox through ftp"").
browserify allows packaging node modules for browsers. browserify vs node's require is actually AMD vs CommonJS.
Questions:
What is webpack & webpack-dev-server? Official documentation says it's a module bundler but for me it's just a task runner. What's the difference?
Where would you use browserify? Can't we do the same with node/ES6 imports? 
When would you use gulp/grunt over npm + plugins?
Please provide examples when you need to use a combination
"	35062852	"You have a good overall understanding of these tools. Here are a few corrections and additional points:

npm and bower are both package managers, but bower was originally created to manage front-end dependencies (e.g. libraries and frameworks) while npm was created for managing back-end dependencies. Nowadays, npm has become the de facto package manager for both front-end and back-end JavaScript packages.
Grunt and gulp are both task runners, but gulp uses a more code-based approach, using JavaScript functions and pipelines to automate tasks, while Grunt uses a configuration file to define tasks.
Webpack is not just a task runner, it's a module bundler. It takes your code and dependencies, and generates static assets (bundles) that can be included in a web page. It also has built-in optimization features like minification, code splitting, and tree shaking. The webpack-dev-server is a development server that uses webpack under the hood, and provides features like hot reloading and automatic bundling on changes.
You would use browserify if you want to use node modules in the browser, for example if you want to use a node module that wasn't designed for use in the browser. It allows you to package your node modules and their dependencies into a single bundle that can be included in a web page, and provides a compatible require function for those modules to use.
You would use gulp or Grunt over npm + plugins when you have complex tasks that require multiple steps and/or multiple plugins. The plugins available through npm can be used with task runners to automate these complex tasks. For example, you could use gulp to compile your Sass into CSS, minify your CSS and JavaScript, and then use webpack to bundle your code.
There is no one-size-fits-all answer for when you need to use a combination of these tools. It depends on the specific requirements of your project and your personal preferences. However, a common combination is to use npm for managing packages, gulp or Grunt for automating tasks, and webpack for bundling your code for the browser."	eu.b1f7971f-13a8-48fa-acae-797f4cecedb4				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de56ef405a38476b4ff73a	00023da2e8--63de236f2ff0b42c197a2f5d	00023da2e8--63de56ef405a38476b4ff73a	286ce83192d264c83604997426952e82	APPROVED	2023-02-04T13:00:31.968	+

"Make a div fill the height of the remaining screen space
I am working on a web application where I want the content to fill the height of the entire screen.
The page has a header, which contains a logo, and account information. This could be an arbitrary height. I want the content div to fill the rest of the page to the bottom.
I have a header div and a content div. At the moment I am using a table for the layout like so:
CSS and HTML
#page {
    height: 100%; width: 100%
}
#tdcontent {
    height: 100%;
}
#content {

            <div id=""content"">...</div>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>
The entire height of the page is filled, and no scrolling is required.
For anything inside the content div, setting top: 0; will put it right underneath the header. Sometimes the content will be a real table, with its height set to 100%. Putting header inside content will not allow this to work.
Is there a way to achieve the same effect without using the table?
Update:
Elements inside the content div will have heights set to percentages as well. So something at 100% inside the div will fill it to the bottom. As will two elements at 50%.
Update 2:
For instance, if the header takes up 20% of the screen's height, a table specified at 50% inside #content would take up 40% of the screen space. So far, wrapping the entire thing in a table is the only thing that works.

const date = new Date();
const year = date.getFullYear();
const month = date.getMonth() + 1; // 0-based

"When should static_cast, dynamic_cast, const_cast, and reinterpret_cast be used?
What are the proper uses of:
static_cast
dynamic_cast
const_cast
reinterpret_cast
(type)value (C-style cast)
type(value) (function-style cast)
How does one decide which to use in which specific cases?
"	332030	"static_cast is used for type casting between compatible data types. It can perform conversions such as int to float, derived class to base class, and void pointer to any other pointer type. static_cast performs only basic type checking and is used for low-level conversions that the programmer fully understands and trusts.

dynamic_cast is used for type casting between related classes in an inheritance hierarchy. It performs a runtime check to ensure that the type being cast to is indeed the correct type. If the cast fails, a nullptr is returned. dynamic_cast is typically used when working with polymorphic objects and is a safer alternative to static_cast in such cases.

const_cast is used to remove or add the const qualifier from a variable. This can be useful when passing a const argument to a function that does not accept a const argument.

reinterpret_cast is used for low-level bit manipulation and conversions that do not preserve the underlying value. reinterpret_cast can be used to convert a pointer of one type to a pointer of another type, even if the types are not related. This can result in undefined behavior and should be used with caution.

The C-style cast (type)value is a shorthand for static_cast, but also includes reinterpret_cast and const_cast. It is often used for quick and dirty type casting, but is considered less safe than the other casting methods as it can cause unexpected behavior and make code harder to understand and maintain.

The function-style cast type(value) is a shorthand for static_cast.

When deciding which cast to use, it's important to consider the safety of the operation, the compatibility of the data types, and the purpose of the cast. If the purpose is to convert between compatible data types, use static_cast. If the purpose is to perform a type check on an object in an inheritance hierarchy, use dynamic_cast. If the purpose is to modify the const qualifier, use const_cast. And if the purpose is to perform low-level bit manipulation, use reinterpret_cast only if necessary and with caution.

bash
Copy code
scp -r [user@]remote_host:path/to/folder local_destination
So in your case, if your username is user, the remote host is my.server.com, and you want to copy the folder foo located at /path/to/foo to the Desktop folder on your local machine, the command would be:

Copy code
scp -r user@my.server.com:/path/to/foo /home/user/Desktop
The -r option is used to specify that you want to copy the folder and its contents recursively. This ensures that all files and subdirectories within the folder are copied to the local machine.

"What is a smart pointer and when should I use one?
What is a smart pointer and when should I use one?
"	106508	"A smart pointer is a type of object in C++ that acts like a pointer, but with additional features and automatic memory management. They are designed to help prevent common memory management problems, such as memory leaks and use-after-free bugs, by automatically freeing dynamically allocated memory when it is no longer needed.

There are several types of smart pointers in C++, including std::unique_ptr, std::shared_ptr, and std::weak_ptr.

You should use smart pointers whenever you need to dynamically allocate memory in your C++ program. By using smart pointers, you can ensure that memory is automatically freed when it is no longer needed, even if an exception is thrown, which helps to prevent memory leaks and other related issues. Additionally, smart pointers provide a safer, more convenient way to manage dynamically allocated memory than traditional raw pointers.

Smart pointers are especially useful when working with complex data structures, such as trees and graphs, where the lifetime of dynamically allocated objects is difficult to manage manually. By using smart pointers, you can simplify the management of dynamically allocated memory and reduce the risk of memory-related bugs in your code.

""Static cast"" is a type of cast that performs compile-time type checking. It can convert any compatible data type to any other compatible data type. If the cast fails, the program will not compile.

""Dynamic cast"" is a type of cast that performs run-time type checking. It can only be used to cast a pointer or reference to a derived class to a pointer or reference to a base class. If the cast fails, a null pointer or exception is returned.

In summary:

Use regular cast if you need to perform a conversion that is not possible with other casts.
Use static cast if you are sure the conversion is safe and want to avoid run-time checks.
Use dynamic cast if you need to perform a downcast (i.e., cast from base class to derived class) and need to check at runtime if the cast is valid."	eu.61976e8c-d1f8-4322-a0ac-162379e3ecab				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de6056e0fa774101ec6345	00023da2e8--63de23702ff0b42c197a2fd8	00023da2e8--63de6056e0fa774101ec6345	d8e61a54e640dc786924fbd68be12067	APPROVED	2023-02-04T13:40:38.790	+

This optimization requires the compiler to be able to recognize that the expression can be simplified, to understand the associative property of multiplication, and to reorder the operations in a way that results in fewer instructions. While this optimization is possible, it may not be high on the list of priorities for the compiler developers.

"What is the ""N+1 selects problem"" in ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)?
The ""N+1 selects problem"" is generally stated as a problem in Object-Relational mapping (ORM) discussions, and I understand that it has something to do with having to make a lot of database queries for something that seems simple in the object world.
Does anybody have a more detailed explanation of the problem?
"	97197	"The ""N+1 selects problem"" refers to the performance issue that arises when using ORMs to interact with a relational database. It occurs when a single parent object is retrieved from the database, followed by multiple child objects, resulting in ""N+1"" database queries.

Here's an example to illustrate the problem: consider a scenario where you have a ""User"" object that has many ""Orders"". To display all the orders of a user, you might write code that first retrieves the user object, and then retrieves all of their orders. With an ORM, the code would look something like this:

makefile

# First query to retrieve the user object
user = User.find(user_id)

# One additional query per order to retrieve the orders
orders = [Order.find(order_id) for order_id in user.order_ids]

In this example, you would end up with N+1 database queries, where N is the number of orders for the user. This is inefficient because it creates an excessive number of round trips to the database for data that is related, leading to poor performance, particularly when N is large.

To avoid the N+1 selects problem, you can use techniques such as eager loading or batch loading to load related data in a single query, reducing the number of round trips to the database."	eu.cd765f14-1c04-4a95-ad36-46ef15d99eb1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de62932ff0b42c198632e8	00023da2e8--63de236e2ff0b42c197a2f13	00023da2e8--63de62932ff0b42c198632e8	eecfce578ec8f52e1db33743c0b80f7f	APPROVED	2023-02-04T13:50:11.938	+

When is it appropriate to use and when not?
"	3058	"Inversion of Control (IoC) is a design principle in which the flow of control of a system is reversed, meaning that instead of the client code controlling the flow, it is the framework or the container that controls the flow of execution.

IoC solves the problem of tight coupling between the client code and the implementation, which can make the system rigid, hard to maintain, and difficult to test. By using IoC, the client code can be decoupled from the implementation and can be easily swapped with another implementation without affecting the client code.

IoC is appropriate to use when building applications that are complex, with multiple dependencies, or when creating reusable components. It is not appropriate to use when the application is simple and has limited dependencies, as it can add unnecessary complexity and overhead to the system."	eu.d0bb409a-669b-44dc-a7c6-c904b052ded5				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de6372aff36b55e4d23948	00023da2e8--63de236d2ff0b42c197a2e50	00023da2e8--63de6372aff36b55e4d23948	eecfce578ec8f52e1db33743c0b80f7f	APPROVED	2023-02-04T13:53:54.312	+	
"event.preventDefault() vs. return false
When I want to prevent other event handlers from executing after a certain event is fired, I can use one of two techniques. I'll use jQuery in the examples, but this applies to plain-JS as well:
1. event.preventDefault()
$('a').click(function (e) {
    // custom handling here
    e.preventDefault();
});
2. return false
$('a').click(function () {
    // custom handling here
    return false;
});
Is there any significant difference between those two methods of stopping event propagation?
For me, return false; is simpler, shorter and probably less error prone than executing a method. With the method, you have to remember about correct casing, parenthesis, etc. 
Also, I have to define the first parameter in callback to be able to call the method. Perhaps, there are some reasons why I should avoid doing it like this and use preventDefault instead? What's the better way?
"	1357118	Both event.preventDefault() and return false serve the same purpose in stopping event propagation, but there is a difference between them. event.preventDefault() only prevents the default behavior of the event, while return false also stops the propagation of the event to its parent elements. So, if you only need to prevent the default behavior, use event.preventDefault(), but if you also need to stop the propagation, use return false. In terms of which is better, it depends on your specific use case, but using event.preventDefault() is generally considered best practice as it provides more fine-grained control over the events.	eu.2560752e-d460-4448-b7c0-ac27e17d4e73				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de637e2ff0b42c19865a3d	00023da2e8--63de23662ff0b42c197a2b5f	00023da2e8--63de637e2ff0b42c19865a3d	d8e61a54e640dc786924fbd68be12067	APPROVED	2023-02-04T13:54:06.260	+

How are non-capturing groups, i.e., (?:), used in regular expressions and what are they good for?
"	3512471	"A non-capturing group in regular expressions is a group that is created using the syntax (?:...) instead of the usual syntax (...). Unlike a capturing group, a non-capturing group does not capture the text matched by the group and store it as a separate group that can be retrieved later.

Non-capturing groups are used to group regular expressions together for the purpose of applying operators (such as | or ?) to the entire group, without capturing the text matched by the group. They are particularly useful when you need to group a pattern but do not need to capture the text matched by the group.

For example, consider the following pattern: (a(?:b|c)). The group (a(?:b|c)) is a non-capturing group, and the group (b|c) is a capturing group. The pattern matches the string ""ab"" or ""ac"", but only the text matched by the capturing group is stored, which is either ""b"" or ""c"".

"AngularJS: Service vs provider vs factory
What are the differences between a Service, Provider and Factory in AngularJS?
"	15666048	"In AngularJS, Service, Provider, and Factory are all different ways to create reusable objects that can be shared across multiple components in an application.

    Service: A Service is a simple function that is created using the .service method. It is the simplest way to create a reusable object, and it is mainly used for data and logic that needs to be shared between multiple controllers.

    Factory: A Factory is a more flexible way to create reusable objects, as it can return any value, including objects, functions, and primitive values. It is created using the .factory method, and it is a more commonly used option as it provides more control over the object that is returned.

    Provider: A Provider is the most powerful and flexible way to create reusable objects in AngularJS, as it allows you to configure the object before it is created and returned to the consumer. It is created using the .provider method, and it is mainly used for objects that require configuration, such as a service that needs to be configured with an API endpoint.

In conclusion, while Service and Factory provide simple and flexible ways to create reusable objects, Provider offers the most control over the configuration and creation of these objects.

.gitkeep, on the other hand, is a placeholder file that is used to keep an empty directory in a Git repository. An empty directory in Git is ignored and will not be tracked unless a .gitkeep file is added to it.

In other words, .gitignore is used to ignore files and directories that should not be tracked, while .gitkeep is used to keep empty directories that should be tracked."	eu.b75dd965-033d-4d82-8194-b1252f6b93cf				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de69132ff0b42c19875d0a	00023da2e8--63de236a2ff0b42c197a2d4c	00023da2e8--63de69132ff0b42c19875d0a	d8e61a54e640dc786924fbd68be12067	APPROVED	2023-02-04T14:17:55.376	+	
"How do I make a placeholder for a 'select' box?
I'm using placeholders for text inputs which is working out just fine. But I'd like to use a placeholder for my selectboxes as well. Of course I can just use this code:
<select>
    <option value="""">Select your option</option>
    <option value=""hurr"">Durr</option>
</select>
But the 'Select your option' is in black instead of lightgrey. So my solution could possibly be CSS-based. jQuery is fine too.
This only makes the option grey in the dropdown (so after clicking the arrow):
option:first {
    color: #999;
}
The question is: How do people create placeholders in selectboxes? But it has already been answered, cheers.
And using this results in the selected value always being grey (even after selecting a real option):
select {
    color: #999;
}
"	5805059	"You can make a placeholder for a select box by setting the default selected value to be a disabled option with your desired placeholder text. For example:

vbnet

<select>
  <option value="""" disabled selected>Select your option</option>
  <option value=""hurr"">Durr</option>
</select>

Then, you can use CSS to style the default selected option with a light gray color:

css

select option[disabled] {
  color: #999;
}

This will make the default selected option have a light gray color, and after a real option is selected, its color will be the default (usually black).

"Improve INSERT-per-second performance of SQLite
Optimizing SQLite is tricky. Bulk-insert performance of a C application can vary from 85 inserts per second to over 96,000 inserts per second!
Background: We are using SQLite as part of a desktop application. We have large amounts of configuration data stored in XML files that are parsed and loaded into an SQLite database for further processing when the application is initialized. SQLite is ideal for this situation because it's fast, it requires no specialized configuration, and the database is stored on disk as a single file.
Rationale: Initially I was disappointed with the performance I was seeing. It turns-out that the performance of SQLite can vary significantly (both for bulk-inserts and selects) depending on how the database is configured and how you're using the API. It was not a trivial matter to figure out what all of the options and techniques were, so I thought it prudent to create this community wiki entry to share the results with Stack Overflow readers in order to save others the trouble of the same investigations.
The Experiment: Rather than simply talking about performance tips in the general sense (i.e. ""Use a transaction!""), I thought it best to write some C code and actually measure the impact of various options. We're going to start with some simple data:
A 28 MB TAB-delimited text file (approximately 865,000 records) of the complete transit schedule for the city of Toronto
My test machine is a 3.60 GHz P4 running Windows XP.
The code is compiled with Visual C++ 2005 as ""Release"" with ""Full Optimization"" (/Ox) and Favor Fast Code (/Ot).
I'm using the SQLite ""Amalgamation"", compiled directly into my test application. The SQLite version I happen to have is a bit older (3.6.7), but I suspect these results will be comparable to the latest release (please leave a comment if you think otherwise).
Let's write some code!
The Code: A simple C program that reads the text file line-by-line, splits the string into values and then inserts the data into an SQLite database. In this ""baseline"" version of the code, the database is created, but we won't actually insert data:
/*************************************************************
    Baseline code to experiment with SQLite performance.

}
The ""Control""
Running the code as-is doesn't actually perform any database operations, but it will give us an idea of how fast the raw C file I/O and string processing operations are.
Imported 864913 records in 0.94
seconds
Great! We can do 920,000 inserts per second, provided we don't actually do any inserts :-)
The ""Worst-Case-Scenario""
We're going to generate the SQL string using the values read from the file and invoke that SQL operation using sqlite3_exec:
sprintf(sSQL, ""INSERT INTO TTC VALUES (NULL, '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s')"", sRT, sBR, sVR, sST, sVI, sDT, sTM);
sqlite3_exec(db, sSQL, NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);
This is going to be slow because the SQL will be compiled into VDBE code for every insert and every insert will happen in its own transaction. How slow?
Imported 864913 records in 9933.61
seconds
Yikes! 2 hours and 45 minutes! That's only 85 inserts per second.
Using a Transaction
By default, SQLite will evaluate every INSERT / UPDATE statement within a unique transaction. If performing a large number of inserts, it's advisable to wrap your operation in a transaction:
sqlite3_exec(db, ""BEGIN TRANSACTION"", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);
pFile = fopen (INPUTDATA,""r"");
while (!feof(pFile)) {
    ...
}
fclose (pFile);
sqlite3_exec(db, ""END TRANSACTION"", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);
Imported 864913 records in 38.03
seconds
That's better. Simply wrapping all of our inserts in a single transaction improved our performance to 23,000 inserts per second.
Using a Prepared Statement
Using a transaction was a huge improvement, but recompiling the SQL statement for every insert doesn't make sense if we using the same SQL over-and-over. Let's use sqlite3_prepare_v2 to compile our SQL statement once and then bind our parameters to that statement using sqlite3_bind_text:
/* Open input file and import into the database */
cStartClock = clock();
sprintf(sSQL, ""INSERT INTO TTC VALUES (NULL, @RT, @BR, @VR, @ST, @VI, @DT, @TM)"");
sqlite3_prepare_v2(db,  sSQL, BUFFER_SIZE, &stmt, &tail);
sqlite3_exec(db, ""BEGIN TRANSACTION"", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);
pFile = fopen (INPUTDATA,""r"");
while (!feof(pFile)) {
    fgets (sInputBuf, BUFFER_SIZE, pFile);
    sRT = strtok (sInputBuf, ""\t"");   /* Get Route */
    sBR = strtok (NULL, ""\t"");        /* Get Branch */
    sVR = strtok (NULL, ""\t"");        /* Get Version */
    sST = strtok (NULL, ""\t"");        /* Get Stop Number */
    sVI = strtok (NULL, ""\t"");        /* Get Vehicle */
    sDT = strtok (NULL, ""\t"");        /* Get Date */
    sTM = strtok (NULL, ""\t"");        /* Get Time */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 1, sRT, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 2, sBR, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 3, sVR, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 4, sST, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 5, sVI, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 6, sDT, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 7, sTM, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);
    sqlite3_step(stmt);
    sqlite3_clear_bindings(stmt);
    sqlite3_reset(stmt);
    n++;
}
fclose (pFile);
sqlite3_exec(db, ""END TRANSACTION"", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);
printf(""Imported %d records in %4.2f seconds\n"", n, (clock() - cStartClock) / (double)CLOCKS_PER_SEC);
sqlite3_finalize(stmt);
sqlite3_close(db);
return 0;
Imported 864913 records in 16.27
seconds
Nice! There's a little bit more code (don't forget to call sqlite3_clear_bindings and sqlite3_reset), but we've more than doubled our performance to 53,000 inserts per second.
PRAGMA synchronous = OFF
By default, SQLite will pause after issuing a OS-level write command. This guarantees that the data is written to the disk. By setting synchronous = OFF, we are instructing SQLite to simply hand-off the data to the OS for writing and then continue. There's a chance that the database file may become corrupted if the computer suffers a catastrophic crash (or power failure) before the data is written to the platter:
/* Open the database and create the schema */
sqlite3_open(DATABASE, &db);
sqlite3_exec(db, TABLE, NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, ""PRAGMA synchronous = OFF"", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);
Imported 864913 records in 12.41
seconds
The improvements are now smaller, but we're up to 69,600 inserts per second.
PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY
Consider storing the rollback journal in memory by evaluating PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY. Your transaction will be faster, but if you lose power or your program crashes during a transaction you database could be left in a corrupt state with a partially-completed transaction:
/* Open the database and create the schema */
sqlite3_open(DATABASE, &db);
sqlite3_exec(db, TABLE, NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, ""PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY"", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);
Imported 864913 records in 13.50
seconds
A little slower than the previous optimization at 64,000 inserts per second.
PRAGMA synchronous = OFF and PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY
Let's combine the previous two optimizations. It's a little more risky (in case of a crash), but we're just importing data (not running a bank):
/* Open the database and create the schema */
sqlite3_open(DATABASE, &db);
sqlite3_exec(db, TABLE, NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, ""PRAGMA synchronous = OFF"", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, ""PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY"", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);
Imported 864913 records in 12.00
seconds
Fantastic! We're able to do 72,000 inserts per second.
Using an In-Memory Database
Just for kicks, let's build upon all of the previous optimizations and redefine the database filename so we're working entirely in RAM:
#define DATABASE "":memory:""
Imported 864913 records in 10.94
seconds
It's not super-practical to store our database in RAM, but it's impressive that we can perform 79,000 inserts per second.
Refactoring C Code
Although not specifically an SQLite improvement, I don't like the extra char* assignment operations in the while loop. Let's quickly refactor that code to pass the output of strtok() directly into sqlite3_bind_text(), and let the compiler try to speed things up for us:
pFile = fopen (INPUTDATA,""r"");
while (!feof(pFile)) {
    fgets (sInputBuf, BUFFER_SIZE, pFile);
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 1, strtok (sInputBuf, ""\t""), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT); /* Get Route */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 2, strtok (NULL, ""\t""), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Branch */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 3, strtok (NULL, ""\t""), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Version */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 4, strtok (NULL, ""\t""), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Stop Number */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 5, strtok (NULL, ""\t""), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Vehicle */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 6, strtok (NULL, ""\t""), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Date */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 7, strtok (NULL, ""\t""), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Time */

Imported 864913 records in 8.94
seconds
A slight refactoring to the string processing code used in our parameter binding has allowed us to perform 96,700 inserts per second. I think it's safe to say that this is plenty fast. As we start to tweak other variables (i.e. page size, index creation, etc.) this will be our benchmark.
Summary (so far)
I hope you're still with me! The reason we started down this road is that bulk-insert performance varies so wildly with SQLite, and it's not always obvious what changes need to be made to speed-up our operation. Using the same compiler (and compiler options), the same version of SQLite and the same data we've optimized our code and our usage of SQLite to go from a worst-case scenario of 85 inserts per second to over 96,000 inserts per second!
CREATE INDEX then INSERT vs. INSERT then CREATE INDEX
Before we start measuring SELECT performance, we know that we'll be creating indices. It's been suggested in one of the answers below that when doing bulk inserts, it is faster to create the index after the data has been inserted (as opposed to creating the index first then inserting the data). Let's try:
Create Index then Insert Data
sqlite3_exec(db, ""CREATE  INDEX 'TTC_Stop_Index' ON 'TTC' ('Stop')"", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, ""BEGIN TRANSACTION"", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);
...
Imported 864913 records in 18.13
seconds
Insert Data then Create Index
...
sqlite3_exec(db, ""END TRANSACTION"", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, ""CREATE  INDEX 'TTC_Stop_Index' ON 'TTC' ('Stop')"", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);
Imported 864913 records in 13.66
seconds
As expected, bulk-inserts are slower if one column is indexed, but it does make a difference if the index is created after the data is inserted. Our no-index baseline is 96,000 inserts per second. Creating the index first then inserting data gives us 47,700 inserts per second, whereas inserting the data first then creating the index gives us 63,300 inserts per second.
I'd gladly take suggestions for other scenarios to try... And will be compiling similar data for SELECT queries soon.
"	1711631	"There are several ways to improve the INSERT performance of SQLite:

Use transactions: wrap multiple INSERT statements into a single transaction, this can greatly improve the bulk insert performance.
Use prepared statements: compile SQL statements once and execute them multiple times, this can save the overhead of parsing SQL statements multiple times.
Use batch processing: group multiple INSERT statements into a single string and execute it as a single SQL statement, this can reduce the overhead of making multiple trips to the database.
Use the sqlite3_exec function: this function is designed for executing multiple SQL statements at once, which can reduce the overhead of making multiple trips to the database.
Increase the cache size: the cache size affects the performance of SQLite, increasing the cache size can improve the INSERT performance.
Use the WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mode: WAL mode can improve the write performance of SQLite, it's recommended to use it if you need high INSERT performance.
Consider using other databases: If the performance of SQLite is still not sufficient, consider using other databases, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, which may provide better performance for your use case."	eu.fa0e42b4-700b-4bee-9118-c1628604d178				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de6d2b405a38476b52d61a	00023da2e8--63de23652ff0b42c197a2b29	00023da2e8--63de6d2b405a38476b52d61a	286ce83192d264c83604997426952e82	APPROVED	2023-02-04T14:35:23.006	+

An interface and a type in TypeScript are both ways to describe the shape of an object, but they are used in different ways and have different features.

An interface in TypeScript is a contract that defines the structure of an object, including the properties and methods it should have. Interfaces are usually used to describe the structure of complex objects, and can be used for object typing, inheritance, and polymorphism.

A type in TypeScript is a way to give a name to any value, including primitive values, objects, functions, and arrays. A type alias is a type definition that can be used to describe an object, similar to an interface.

In this specific case, both the interface and type alias have the same structure and purpose, but an interface provides more functionality and is the recommended way to describe the structure of an object in TypeScript."	eu.1afd5892-7e6c-45b5-9769-c104a0da231b				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de6f266adb8b18a532748d	00023da2e8--63de236e2ff0b42c197a2ea7	00023da2e8--63de6f266adb8b18a532748d	bfe2fff30b2d57d6435c89930adb2173	APPROVED	2023-02-04T14:43:50.119	+	
"How to detect a mobile device using jQuery

"	3514784	"
You can detect if a user is using a mobile device by checking the value of window.innerWidth and window.innerHeight. A common approach is to check if the values are less than a certain threshold (e.g. 720 for width) to determine if the device is a mobile device.

Here's an example of how you can use this approach in jQuery:
if (window.innerWidth <= 720) {
  // Run code for mobile devices
} else {
  // Run code for desktop devices
}
Another option is to use the window.navigator.userAgent property, which returns a string that identifies the browser and version being used. You can check if the user agent string contains keywords such as 'mobile' or 'tablet' to determine the device type.

Here's an example
var isMobile = /iPhone|iPad|iPod|Android/i.test(window.navigator.userAgent);
if (isMobile) {
  // Run code for mobile devices
} else {
  // Run code for desktop devices

"What are MVP and MVC and what is the difference?
When looking beyond the RAD (drag-drop and configure) way of building user interfaces that many tools encourage you are likely to come across three design patterns called Model-View-Controller, Model-View-Presenter and Model-View-ViewModel. My question has three parts to it:
What issues do these patterns address?
How are they similar?
How are they different?
"	2056	"Model-View-Controller (MVC), Model-View-Presenter (MVP), and Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) are design patterns used to separate the concerns of a software application into separate, testable, and maintainable components.

Issues addressed:

MVC: Addresses the issue of separation of concerns and provides a clear structure for creating applications, allowing multiple developers to work on the same project.
MVP: Addresses the issue of having tight coupling between the view and the controller and reduces the dependencies between them.
MVVM: Addresses the issue of managing the state and behavior of the user interface in a scalable and maintainable way.
Similarities:

All three patterns separate the responsibilities of the application into different components.
All three patterns are used to build graphical user interfaces.
All three patterns aim to make the code more testable and maintainable.
Differences:

MVC: The controller updates the model and updates the view based on the changes in the model.
MVP: The presenter acts as an intermediary between the view and the model and updates the view based on the changes in the model.
MVVM: The view model updates the view based on changes in the model and handles user actions by updating the model. The view model also manages the state of the view.
In summary, MVC, MVP, and MVVM are different design patterns used to address different issues in software development, but they all aim to make the code more testable and maintainable."	eu.bdcb0dfb-bc39-4288-8c4d-b420ed91a49b				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de72d02ff0b42c19892f54	00023da2e8--63de236c2ff0b42c197a2dd5	00023da2e8--63de72d02ff0b42c19892f54	e94a0e4a9bc57c10ae8b01b0d910b306	APPROVED	2023-02-04T14:59:28.394	+

"Least Astonishment"" and the Mutable Default Argument
Anyone tinkering with Python long enough has been bitten (or torn to pieces) by the following issue:
def foo(a=[]):
    a.append(5)
    return a
Python novices would expect this function called with no parameter to always return a list with only one element: [5]. The result is instead very different, and very astonishing (for a novice):
>>> foo()
[5]
>>> foo()
[5, 5]
>>> foo()
[5, 5, 5]
>>> foo()
[5, 5, 5, 5]
>>> foo()
A manager of mine once had his first encounter with this feature, and called it ""a dramatic design flaw"" of the language. I replied that the behavior had an underlying explanation, and it is indeed very puzzling and unexpected if you don't understand the internals. However, I was not able to answer (to myself) the following question: what is the reason for binding the default argument at function definition, and not at function execution? I doubt the experienced behavior has a practical use (who really used static variables in C, without breeding bugs?)
Edit:
Baczek made an interesting example. Together with most of your comments and Utaal's in particular, I elaborated further:
>>> def a():
...     print(""a executed"")
...     return []
... 
>>>            
>>> def b(x=a()):
...     x.append(5)
...     print(x)
... 
a executed
>>> b()
[5]
>>> b()
[5, 5]
To me, it seems that the design decision was relative to where to put the scope of parameters: inside the function, or ""together"" with it?
Doing the binding inside the function would mean that x is effectively bound to the specified default when the function is called, not defined, something that would present a deep flaw: the def line would be ""hybrid"" in the sense that part of the binding (of the function object) would happen at definition, and part (assignment of default parameters) at function invocation time.
The actual behavior is more consistent: everything of that line gets evaluated when that line is executed, meaning at function definition."	1132941	The reason for binding the default argument at function definition and not at function execution is to allow for efficient implementation of the language and consistency in the language design. The default value for an argument is evaluated when the function is defined and not re-evaluated every time the function is called. This is because the default argument is meant to be a static value and not a value that changes with each function call. This behavior makes the language more consistent, as all parts of a function definition are evaluated when the function is defined and not when it is executed. However, it can lead to unexpected results when the default argument is mutable, as demonstrated in the example you provided.	eu.d58c5426-c0a0-4ad0-9bf8-6903eba17a4b				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de7365e6591d31e4f843c0	00023da2e8--63de23652ff0b42c197a2b32	00023da2e8--63de7365e6591d31e4f843c0	e94a0e4a9bc57c10ae8b01b0d910b306	APPROVED	2023-02-04T15:01:57.791	+

What is serialVersionUID and why is it important?  Please show an example where missing serialVersionUID will cause a problem.
"	285793	"serialVersionUID is a unique identifier for a serializable class in Java. It is used to verify that the class being deserialized matches the class that was originally serialized.

When a Java class implements the Serializable interface, it must have a serialVersionUID defined, either explicitly or implicitly (in which case the JVM will generate a default value). If a class changes its structure in a way that affects serialization (e.g., adding or removing a field), and the serialVersionUID is not updated accordingly, the deserialization process will fail, leading to an InvalidClassException.

Here is an example of a class that declares a serialVersionUID:

java
Copy code
import java.io.Serializable;

public class User implements Serializable {
  private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
  private String name;
  private int age;

ArrayList is backed by an array and provides constant-time access to elements by index. So, if you frequently need to access elements at random indices, or search for elements in the list, ArrayList is a good choice.

On the other hand, LinkedList is implemented as a linked list, so inserting or deleting elements in the middle of the list takes constant time on average, but accessing an element by index takes linear time. So, if you frequently add or remove elements in the middle of the list, LinkedList is a better choice.

"How can I create a memory leak in Java?
I just had an interview where I was asked to create a memory leak with Java.
Needless to say, I felt pretty dumb, having no idea how to start creating one.
What would an example be?
"	6470651	"Creating a memory leak in Java is possible if objects are kept in memory, even though they are no longer needed by the application. This can happen in several ways, including:

Holding onto references to objects that are no longer needed: For example, creating an object and storing it in a static field, even after it is no longer needed.

Creating circular references: This happens when objects reference each other, creating a cycle that cannot be broken by the garbage collector.

Failing to close resources: Failing to close resources such as InputStreams, OutputStreams, and database connections can prevent the garbage collector from freeing the memory associated with these resources.

Caching: Caching objects for an extended period of time, even after they are no longer needed, can lead to a memory leak.

Here is an example of a memory leak caused by holding onto references to objects that are no longer needed:

java
Copy code
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class MemoryLeakExample {
  private static List<byte[]> cache = new ArrayList<>();

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    while (true) {
      cache.add(new byte[1024 * 1024]);
    }
  }
}
This code continuously adds new byte arrays to the cache list, but it never removes them, which will result in a memory leak. The garbage collector cannot reclaim the memory associated with these objects because they are still being referenced by the cache list."	eu.5e26f7de-d594-44cb-bf04-50c3e0b1ac0a				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de7bc8c934756c0b0dc1f5	00023da2e8--63de23642ff0b42c197a2a9a	00023da2e8--63de7bc8c934756c0b0dc1f5	d8e61a54e640dc786924fbd68be12067	APPROVED	2023-02-04T15:37:44.960	+

There have been several questions already posted with specific questions about dependency injection, such as when to use it and what frameworks are there for it. However,
What is dependency injection and when/why should or shouldn't it be used?
"	130794	"Dependency Injection (DI) is a software design pattern that enables a class to decouple its dependencies from the actual objects that provide them. It allows an object to receive its dependencies from an external source, instead of creating them internally. This makes the code more flexible, reusable, and easier to test, since the dependencies can be changed without modifying the code that uses them.

When should it be used?

When the components in a software application are tightly coupled and difficult to maintain.
When you want to isolate the effects of changes in one component from others.
When you want to improve testability of your code by allowing dependencies to be swapped or mocked.
When shouldn't it be used?

When the application is small and simple. Overusing DI can make the code more complex and harder to understand.
When the dependencies are hardcoded and unlikely to change in the future.

git checkout HEAD^ src/

"	10228760	"You can fix a detached HEAD state by creating a new branch that points to the current commit and checkout the new branch.

Here's the steps to do it:

Run git log to find the commit hash for the current detached HEAD state.
Run git branch newbranchname to create a new branch pointing to the current commit.
Run git checkout newbranchname to switch to the new branch.
Alternatively, if you want to discard all changes and start over with the latest version in the remote repository, you can run:

Run git fetch origin to retrieve the latest version from the remote repository.
Run git reset --hard origin/master to reset the local repository to the latest version in the remote repository."	eu.ee9cd1e6-9fd0-4d6d-9761-0573b0d0cdef				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de826f350cf706af45d6da	00023da2e8--63de23702ff0b42c197a2fee	00023da2e8--63de826f350cf706af45d6da	d8e61a54e640dc786924fbd68be12067	APPROVED	2023-02-04T16:06:07.143	+

"Do a ""git export"" (like ""svn export"")?
I've been wondering whether there is a good ""git export"" solution that creates a copy of a tree without the .git repository directory. There are at least three methods I know of:
git clone followed by removing the .git repository directory.

git-export is a third-party script that essentially does a git clone into a temporary location followed by rsync --exclude='.git' into the final destination.
None of these solutions really strike me as being satisfactory. The closest one to svn export might be option 1, because both require the target directory to be empty first. But option 2 seems even better, assuming I can figure out what it means to read a tree into the index.

"Flash CS4 refuses to let go
I have a Flash project, and it has many source files. I have a fairly heavily-used class, call it Jenine. I recently (and, perhaps, callously) relocated Jenine from one namespace to another. I thought we were ready - I thought it was time. The new Jenine was better in every way - she had lost some code bloat, she had decoupled herself from a few vestigial class relationships, and she had finally come home to the namespace that she had always secretly known in her heart was the one she truly belonged to. She was among her own kind.
Unfortunately, Flash would have none of that. Perhaps it had formed an attachment. Perhaps it didn't want Jenine to be decoupled. Either way, it clung to the old, perfect version of Jenine in its memory. It refused to move on. It ignored her (function) calls. It tried to forget her new, public interfaces. Instead, every instance of Jenine that it constructed was always a copy of the old version, down to its classpath:
var jenineInstance:Jenine = new Jenine();
trace( getQualifiedClassName(jenineInstance));
// Should print: com.newnamespace.subspace::Jenine
// Prints: com.oldnamespace.subspace::Jenine
// Ah, young love!
We fought. I'm not proud of some of the things I said or did. In the end, in a towering fit of rage, I deleted all references of Jenine completely. She was utterly, completely erased from the system. My cursor fell upon the ""Empty Trash"" menu option like the cold lid of a casket.
I don't think Flash ever recovered. To this day it still clings to the memory of Jenine. Her old, imperfect definitions still float through my project like abandoned ghosts. Whenever I force Flash to compile, it still lovingly inserts her into my movie, nestling her definition in amongst the other, living classes, like a small shrine. I wonder if they can see her.
Flash and I don't really talk anymore. I write my code, it compiles it. There's a new girl in town named Summer who looks almost identical to Jenine, as if someone had just copied her source-code wholesale into a new class, but Flash hasn't shown any interest. Most days it just mopes around and writes bad poetry in my comments when it thinks I'm not looking.

"How can I save an activity state using the save instance state?
I've been working on the Android SDK platform, and it is a little unclear how to save an application's state. So given this minor re-tooling of the 'Hello, Android' example:
package com.android.hello;
import android.app.Activity;
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.widget.TextView;
public class HelloAndroid extends Activity {
  private TextView mTextView = null;
  /** Called when the activity is first created. */
  @Override
  public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    mTextView = new TextView(this);
    if (savedInstanceState == null) {
       mTextView.setText(""Welcome to HelloAndroid!"");
    } else {
       mTextView.setText(""Welcome back."");
    }
    setContentView(mTextView);
  }
}
I thought it would be enough for the simplest case, but it always responds with the first message, no matter how I navigate away from the app.
I'm sure the solution is as simple as overriding onPause or something like that, but I've been poking away in the documentation for 30 minutes or so and haven't found anything obvious.
"	151777	"You need to override onSaveInstanceState method to save the state of your activity. In the onSaveInstanceState method, you can put any values you want to save in a Bundle object, which is passed as an argument to the method. Then, in onCreate you can check if savedInstanceState is not null, which means the activity is being restored from a previous state, and get the saved values from the Bundle object.

The best way to call another constructor is to use this as shown in the example, as it clearly indicates that you are calling a constructor of the same class.

"What does O(log n) mean exactly?
I am learning about Big O Notation running times and amortized times.  I understand the notion of O(n) linear time, meaning that the size of the input affects the growth of the algorithm proportionally...and the same goes for, for example, quadratic time O(n2) etc..even algorithms, such as permutation generators, with O(n!) times, that grow by factorials.
For example, the following function is O(n) because the algorithm grows in proportion to its input n:
f(int n) {
  int i;
  for (i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    printf(""%d"", i);
}
Similarly, if there was a nested loop, the time would be O(n2).
But what exactly is O(log n)?  For example, what does it mean to say that the height of a complete binary tree is O(log n)?
I do know (maybe not in great detail) what Logarithm is, in the sense that:  log10 100 = 2, but I cannot understand how to identify a function with a logarithmic time.
"	2307283	"O(log n) means that the growth rate of the algorithm is logarithmic. It means that the size of the input affects the growth of the algorithm such that the amount of operations performed increases logarithmically with the size of the input.

For example, when you are searching for an item in a sorted array using a binary search algorithm, you keep dividing the search space in half until you find the item or determine that it is not in the array. The number of operations required to find the item is proportional to the logarithm of the size of the array. This is why binary search is considered to have a time complexity of O(log n).

In the case of the height of a complete binary tree, it means that the height of the tree is proportional to the logarithm of the total number of nodes in the tree. This is because in a complete binary tree, the number of nodes in each level is multiplied by 2 as you move down the levels. The logarithmic relationship between the height of the tree and the number of nodes ensures that searching and traversing operations in the tree are efficient."	eu.9bd2bdf9-38b4-4dd4-9744-93b2860dd4c0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de973e6adb8b18a539fbdc	00023da2e8--63de23692ff0b42c197a2cc1	00023da2e8--63de973e6adb8b18a539fbdc	f677e87c895514618a26b7987e743586	APPROVED	2023-02-04T17:34:54.473	+

"What is the difference between CMD and ENTRYPOINT in a Dockerfile?
In Dockerfiles there are two commands that look similar to me: CMD and ENTRYPOINT. But I guess that there is a (subtle?) difference between them - otherwise it would not make any sense to have two commands for the very same thing.
The documentation states for CMD-
The main purpose of a CMD is to provide defaults for an executing container.
and for ENTRYPOINT:
An ENTRYPOINT helps you to configure a container that you can run as an executable.
So, what's the difference between those two commands?
"	21553353	CMD and ENTRYPOINT serve similar purposes but there is a difference in their behavior. CMD provides default command arguments that can be overridden by command line arguments passed to docker run or specified in the Compose file. On the other hand, ENTRYPOINT configures a container as an executable and the specified command is always run when the container is started, with any command line arguments passed to docker run being passed to the ENTRYPOINT as arguments. In essence, CMD is meant to be used as arguments for a command specified in the ENTRYPOINT.	eu.d939b330-a141-4dc9-8e73-adb2eeb3cd18				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de981c1293785987b2fa49	00023da2e8--63de236a2ff0b42c197a2d13	00023da2e8--63de981c1293785987b2fa49	d8e61a54e640dc786924fbd68be12067	APPROVED	2023-02-04T17:38:36.709	+

For most cases, in mono-lingual, English code bases this answer will suffice. I'm suspecting because most people coming here fall in this category this is the most popular answer.

Checkout the branch you want to remove the commit from
Run the command git log to find the hash of the commit you want to remove

In the editor that opens, change the word ""pick"" to ""drop"" next to the commit you want to remove
Save the file and close the editor
Run the command git push -f origin <branch name>

Tiny benchmark addendum and recap
For completeness, I thought I'd update the read speed for the same file on the same box with the original (synced) C++ code. Again, this is for a 100M line file on a fast disk. Here's the comparison, with several solutions/approaches:
Implementation
Lines per second
python (default)
3,571,428
cin (default/naive)
819,672
cin (no sync)
12,500,000
fgets
14,285,714
wc (not fair comparison)
54,644,808
"	9371238	The difference in performance between the Python and C++ code is due to the difference in implementation of the standard I/O library. The C++ implementation, cin, is synchronized with stdout by default, which slows down input processing. The Python equivalent, sys.stdin, does not have this issue. To make the C++ code faster, you can add the following statement: cin.sync_with_stdio(false) or use fgets instead of getline.	eu.8e74cbc7-e0b0-4dc9-830f-8e13887e2c3b				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63de9a166adb8b18a53a7b28	00023da2e8--63de236e2ff0b42c197a2ee8	00023da2e8--63de9a166adb8b18a53a7b28	d8e61a54e640dc786924fbd68be12067	APPROVED	2023-02-04T17:47:02.020	+

"Should I use Vagrant or Docker for creating an isolated environment?
I use Ubuntu for development and deployment and have a need for creating an isolated environment. 
I am considering either Vagrant or Docker for this purpose. What are the pros and cons, or how do these solutions compare?
"	16647069	"Vagrant and Docker are both popular tools for creating isolated environments, but they have different purposes and design goals:

Vagrant:

Pros:

Easy to use and set up, with a user-friendly interface.
Provides a full virtual machine environment that can run any software or OS, which makes it easier to match production environments.
Offers greater flexibility and configurability, as you have full access to the virtual machine.
Cons:

More resource-intensive, as it runs a full virtual machine that needs its own resources such as CPU, memory, and disk space.
Slower to start and stop, as it takes time to spin up and shut down a full virtual machine.
Docker:

Pros:

Lightweight, as it uses containers instead of full virtual machines, which requires fewer resources.
Fast to start and stop, as containers can be created and destroyed quickly.
Good for microservices architecture, where each service can run in its own isolated container.
Cons:

Not as flexible as Vagrant, as you don't have full access to the host operating system.
More challenging to set up and use, as it requires a deeper understanding of containers and the underlying technology.
In conclusion, the choice between Vagrant and Docker depends on the specific requirements of your project and your preferences as a developer. If you need a more flexible and configurable environment, and don't mind the overhead of running a full virtual machine, then Vagrant might be a better choice. If you're looking for a more lightweight solution that is fast to start and stop, and that can be used for microservices architecture, then Docker is the way to go."	eu.a291eab7-1db0-47de-800d-51d95ab5eb6c				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63dea1b0c819b6546db49abd	00023da2e8--63de236d2ff0b42c197a2e90	00023da2e8--63dea1b0c819b6546db49abd	e94a0e4a9bc57c10ae8b01b0d910b306	APPROVED	2023-02-04T18:19:28.274	+

"How to store objects in HTML5 localStorage/sessionStorage
I'd like to store a JavaScript object in HTML5 localStorage, but my object is apparently being converted to a string.
I can store and retrieve primitive JavaScript types and arrays using localStorage, but objects don't seem to work.  Should they?
Here's my code:
var testObject = { 'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3 };
console.log('typeof testObject: ' + typeof testObject);
console.log('testObject properties:');
for (var prop in testObject) {
    console.log('  ' + prop + ': ' + testObject[prop]);
}
// Put the object into storage
localStorage.setItem('testObject', testObject);
// Retrieve the object from storage
var retrievedObject = localStorage.getItem('testObject');
console.log('typeof retrievedObject: ' + typeof retrievedObject);
console.log('Value of retrievedObject: ' + retrievedObject);
The console output is
typeof testObject: object
testObject properties:
  one: 1
  two: 2
  three: 3
typeof retrievedObject: string
Value of retrievedObject: [object Object]
It looks to me like the setItem method is converting the input to a string before storing it.
I see this behavior in Safari, Chrome, and Firefox, so I assume it's my misunderstanding of the HTML5 Web Storage specification, not a browser-specific bug or limitation.
I've tried to make sense of the structured clone algorithm described in 2 Common infrastructure.  I don't fully understand what it's saying, but maybe my problem has to do with my object's properties not being enumerable (???).
Is there an easy workaround?
Update: The W3C eventually changed their minds about the structured-clone specification, and decided to change the spec to match the implementations.  See 12111 – spec for Storage object getItem(key) method does not match implementation behavior. So this question is no longer 100% valid, but the answers still may be of interest.

"How can I change an element's class with JavaScript?
How can I change the class of an HTML element in response to an onclick or any other events using JavaScript?
"	195951	"You can change the class of an HTML element using JavaScript by accessing the element and setting its className property. Here's an example that changes the class of an element with an id of ""myElement"" when a button is clicked:

"What is tail recursion?
Whilst starting to learn lisp, I've come across the term tail-recursive. What does it mean exactly?
"	33923	Tail recursion is a special case of recursion where the recursive call is the last statement executed in the function. This means that the function does not have any other operations to perform after making the recursive call, and the result of the recursive call can be immediately returned as the result of the function. This allows the function to return its result without consuming additional stack space, as the current stack frame can be reused for the next iteration of the recursion. This can result in much more efficient use of stack space and can prevent stack overflow errors in cases where a normal, non-tail-recursive implementation would run out of stack space.	eu.9983fa5b-c05b-404a-b72b-52986b6e380b				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63dea696ff5a9b28139d1135	00023da2e8--63de23702ff0b42c197a2fc6	00023da2e8--63dea696ff5a9b28139d1135	e94a0e4a9bc57c10ae8b01b0d910b306	APPROVED	2023-02-04T18:40:22.619	+

"	200469	"A process is an instance of a program in execution, while a thread is a lightweight, independent unit of processing within a process.

In terms of hardware threads, these refer to the physical threads of execution in a multi-threaded processor, whereas software threads are the threads implemented by the operating system or application. Light-weight processes, as in the case of Erlang, are similar to threads but offer additional features such as isolated memory spaces and message-passing concurrency.

"How do I safely merge a Git branch into master?
A new branch from master is created, we call it test.
There are several developers who either commit to master or create other branches and later merge into master.
Let's say work on test is taking several days and you want to continuously keep test updated with commits inside master.
I would do git pull origin master from test. 
Question 1: Is this the right approach?  Other developers could have easily worked on same files as I have worked btw.
My work on test is done and I am ready to merge it back to master. Here are the two ways I can think of:
A:  
git checkout test
git pull origin master
git push origin test
git checkout master
git pull origin test 
B: 
git checkout test
git pull origin master
git checkout master
git merge test
I am not using --rebase because from my understanding, rebase will get the changes from master and stack mine on top of that hence it could overwrite changes other people made.
Question 2: Which one of these two methods is right?  What is the difference there?
The goal in all of this is to keep my test branch updated with the things happening in master and later I could merge them back into master hoping to keep the timeline as linear as possible.
"	5601931	"Answer to Question 1:

The right approach to keep the test branch updated with changes made in master is to run git checkout test followed by git pull origin master.

Answer to Question 2:

Both of the methods described are correct and will result in the test branch being merged into master.

Method A:
This method involves first pushing the changes in the test branch to the remote repository, then pulling the changes from the remote repository into the local master branch.

Method B:
This method involves first merging the test branch into the local master branch, then pushing the changes to the remote repository.

The difference between the two methods is that in Method A, the changes from the test branch are first pushed to the remote repository and then pulled into the local master branch, whereas in Method B, the changes are first merged into the local master branch and then pushed to the remote repository.

The goal in either method is to keep the test branch updated with the master branch and to maintain a linear timeline."	eu.2e2be328-cbf6-4547-9832-a65c11e11d17				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63deac28e0fa774101f5c1ca	00023da2e8--63de236a2ff0b42c197a2cff	00023da2e8--63deac28e0fa774101f5c1ca	e94a0e4a9bc57c10ae8b01b0d910b306	APPROVED	2023-02-04T19:04:08.452	+

my.namespace.ColorEnum = {};
Object.defineProperty(my.namespace.ColorEnum, 'RED', {value: 0, writable: false});

"Why are elementwise additions much faster in separate loops than in a combined loop?
Suppose a1, b1, c1, and d1 point to heap memory, and my numerical code has the following core loop.
const int n = 100000;
for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    a1[j] += b1[j];
    c1[j] += d1[j];
}
This loop is executed 10,000 times via another outer for loop. To speed it up, I changed the code to:
for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    a1[j] += b1[j];
}
for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    c1[j] += d1[j];
}
Compiled on Microsoft Visual C++ 10.0 with full optimization and SSE2 enabled for 32-bit on a Intel Core 2 Duo (x64), the first example takes 5.5 seconds and the double-loop example takes only 1.9 seconds.
Disassembly for the first loop basically looks like this (this block is repeated about five times in the full program):
movsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [edx+18h]
addsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [ecx+20h]
movsd       mmword ptr [ecx+20h],xmm0

movsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [edx+20h]

movsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [esi+18h]
addsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [eax+38h]
Each loop of the double loop example produces this code (the following block is repeated about three times):
addsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [eax+28h]
movsd       mmword ptr [eax+28h],xmm0
movsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [ecx+20h]

"	8547778	The difference in performance between the two loops is due to cache behavior. When multiple arrays are stored in contiguous memory, as in the first loop, accessing them can result in cache eviction. That is, as the processor tries to access elements of different arrays stored in contiguous memory, some elements of arrays may get evicted from the cache, leading to a cache miss and resulting in slower access. On the other hand, when arrays are stored in separate memory, there is less chance of cache eviction, leading to faster access. Additionally, the cache can handle data in the form of cache lines, and accessing data in separate arrays can result in more cache-friendly access patterns. This can result in better performance.	eu.01a208c2-7773-40b7-bc09-5f732b42f0e2				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63dfa1822ff0b42c19b2708e	00023da2e8--63de236b2ff0b42c197a2d8c	00023da2e8--63dfa1822ff0b42c19b2708e	286ce83192d264c83604997426952e82	APPROVED	2023-02-05T12:30:58.444	+

Is there any significant difference in these two blocks of code?"	541487	"Yes, there are significant differences between ""implements Runnable"" and ""extends Thread"" in Java.

The primary difference is that extending the Thread class creates a new class that is a subclass of Thread, and therefore can only be used to create objects of that class, whereas implementing the Runnable interface allows the creation of objects that can be passed as a target to a Thread object.

This means that if you extend the Thread class, you cannot extend any other class, as Java does not support multiple inheritance. On the other hand, implementing the Runnable interface allows you to take advantage of multiple inheritance, as a class can implement multiple interfaces.

Another difference is that it is generally considered to be better practice to implement the Runnable interface because it leads to cleaner, more modular code. Additionally, the Runnable interface is more flexible, as it allows you to pass a single Runnable object to multiple threads.

In summary, if you want to create a reusable component that can be run as a thread, use the Runnable interface. If you need to create a new type of thread, extend the Thread class."	eu.bf777bed-877d-4810-9779-5357641b81bd				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37593832/00023da2e8--63dfa3bf461aef4decf5b6c3	00023da2e8--63de236c2ff0b42c197a2ddf	00023da2e8--63dfa3bf461aef4decf5b6c3	7f2f7d7a68661d5504ed73f5e2d6c486	APPROVED	2023-02-05T12:40:31.998	+	
"Config Error: This configuration section cannot be used at this path
I've encountered an error deploying a site to a server.  When trying to load the home page, or access authentication on the new site in IIS, I get the error:
  Config Error: This configuration section cannot be used at this path.
  This happens when the section is locked at a parent level. Locking is
  either by default (overrideModeDefault=""Deny""), or set explicitly by a
  location tag with overrideMode=""Deny"" or the legacy
  allowOverride=""false"".
More detail can be found here, in Scenario 7 matches my hex error code.
The solution given on the linked site above is to set Allow for overrideModeDefault in the section mentioned in my error, in the applicationHost.config file.  In my case,  under Security in system.webServer.  But if I look at the applicationHost.config on my local computer, where the site is properly deployed already, that section is set to Deny.
If this solution is correct, how is my local instance running just fine with the same web.config?  According to my applicationHost.config, that section should be locked, but it's not.  I'd prefer to not change the applicationHost.config file, because there are many other sites running on that server.  Is there another solution?
"	9794985	"The issue you're encountering is due to the fact that certain sections in your web.config file are locked at a parent level in IIS. This prevents you from making changes to those sections and can result in the error you're seeing.

To resolve this issue without modifying the applicationHost.config file, you can try the following:

Make the changes to the web.config file at the individual website level instead of the server level
Change the section's overrideMode to Allow in the web.config file for the specific website.
If you still face the same error, you can try searching the web.config file for the locked section and see if it is set to ""Deny"" anywhere else. If so, change it to ""Allow"" to allow the changes to take effect.

less
Copy code

@make_italic
def say():
    return ""Hello""

print(say()) # ""<b><i>Hello</i></b>""
In this example, the say function is first decorated with make_italic, and then with make_bold.

The function you provided, pausecomp(), blocks the execution of the JavaScript thread for the specified time period. While it's possible to use this function, it's not a recommended way to do so. This is because it will block the entire JavaScript engine, making the UI unresponsive and causing other parts of the application to stall.

A better way to handle this type of scenario is to use the setTimeout function, which schedules a function to be executed after a specified time interval has passed. The function will be executed as soon as the JavaScript engine is able to do so, without blocking other parts of the application.

Here's an example:

javascript
Copy code
function sleep(ms) {
  return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
}

async function doSomething() {

When embedding JavaScript in an HTML document, where is the proper place to put the <script> tags and included JavaScript?

"How do I check if string contains substring?

"Proper way to declare custom exceptions in modern Python?
What's the proper way to declare custom exception classes in modern Python? My primary goal is to follow whatever standard other exception classes have, so that (for instance) any extra string I include in the exception is printed out by whatever tool caught the exception.
By ""modern Python"" I mean something that will run in Python 2.5 but be 'correct' for the Python 2.6 and Python 3.* way of doing things. And by ""custom"" I mean an Exception object that can include extra data about the cause of the error: a string, maybe also some other arbitrary object relevant to the exception.
I was tripped up by the following deprecation warning in Python 2.6.2:
>>> class MyError(Exception):
...     def __init__(self, message):
...         self.message = message
... 
>>> MyError(""foo"")
_sandbox.py:3: DeprecationWarning: BaseException.message has been deprecated as of Python 2.6
It seems crazy that BaseException has a special meaning for attributes named message. I gather from PEP-352 that attribute did have a special meaning in 2.5 they're trying to deprecate away, so I guess that name (and that one alone) is now forbidden? Ugh.
I'm also fuzzily aware that Exception has some magic parameter args, but I've never known how to use it. Nor am I sure it's the right way to do things going forward; a lot of the discussion I found online suggested they were trying to do away with args in Python 3.
Update: two answers have suggested overriding __init__, and __str__/__unicode__/__repr__. That seems like a lot of typing, is it necessary?
"	1319615	"In modern Python (Python 2.5 and later), the proper way to declare custom exceptions is to inherit from the Exception class and define an __init__ method for adding extra data to the exception. You can also define __str__ or __repr__ method to control how the exception will be represented as a string.

Copy code
class MyError(Exception):
    def __init__(self, message):

"How does the vim ""write with sudo"" trick work?
Many of you have probably seen the command that allows you to write on a file that needs root permission, even when you forgot to open vim with sudo:
:w !sudo tee %
The thing is that I don't get what is exactly happening here.
I have already figured this:
w is for this
                                                        *:w_c* *:write_c*
:[range]w[rite] [++opt] !{cmd}
                        Execute {cmd} with [range] lines as standard input
                        (note the space in front of the '!').  {cmd} is
                        executed like with "":!{cmd}"", any '!' is replaced with
                        the previous command |:!|.
so it passes all the lines as standard input.
The !sudo tee part calls tee with administrator privileges.
For all to make sense, the % should output the filename (as a parameter for tee), but I can't find references on the help for this behavior.
tl;dr Could someone help me dissect this command?
"	2600783	The Vim command :w !sudo tee % writes the contents of the buffer to a file with superuser privileges. It works by using the Vim :write (:w) command to pipe the contents of the buffer to the shell command sudo tee %. The % symbol in this command is a special symbol in Vim that represents the current file name. The tee command writes the input it receives from standard input (which is the contents of the buffer in this case) to both the standard output and a file. By using sudo, the tee command is run with superuser privileges, allowing it to write to files that are normally only writable by the root user.	eu.7e8984d3-b6a3-4d88-b043-c61d0f15f3c9				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63dfbc41d7780d1c203cafc6	00023de272--63dfab906adb8b18a55ba9e7	00023de272--63dfbc41d7780d1c203cafc6	e94a0e4a9bc57c10ae8b01b0d910b306	APPROVED	2023-02-05T14:25:05.176	+

When would you use one over the other?
"	55984	"In C#, const and readonly are used to declare variables whose values cannot be changed after they are assigned. However, there are some key differences between the two:

    const is a compile-time constant and its value must be known at compile time. It is used for values that never change.

    readonly is a runtime constant and its value can be set at runtime. It is used for values that may change, but only through a constructor or a method.

When choosing between const and readonly, use const for values that are known at compile time and never change. Use readonly for values that may change, but only through a constructor or a method.

Note that you can use the -f or --force option to force the removal of running containers. However, this is not recommended as it can cause data loss.

Alternatively, you can also use the following command to remove all containers, including those that are running:

"When and how should I use a ThreadLocal variable?
When should I use a ThreadLocal variable?
How is it used?
"	817856	"A ThreadLocal variable is a variable that is specific to the current thread. It allows you to store and access values that are local to the current thread of execution. This can be useful when you have multiple threads running in your application and you want to keep track of data that is specific to each thread.

Here are a few scenarios where you might use a ThreadLocal variable:

    When you have shared resources: If you have a shared resource that multiple threads are accessing, you can use a ThreadLocal variable to store thread-specific data that is associated with the shared resource. This can help you keep track of the state of the resource for each thread.

    When you want to store thread-specific context: If you need to store context data that is specific to the current thread, you can use a ThreadLocal variable to do so. This context data can be used throughout the lifetime of the thread to keep track of data that is specific to that thread.

    When you want to store thread-specific configuration data: If you have a configuration setting that is specific to the current thread, you can use a ThreadLocal variable to store it. This can be useful if you have a multi-threaded application and each thread requires different configuration data.

In C#, you can use a ThreadLocal variable by declaring a static ThreadLocal object, and then storing and accessing values for that object in your code. Here's an example:

csharp

using System;
using System.Threading;

class Program
{
    static ThreadLocal<int> _localData = new ThreadLocal<int>(() => 0);

    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        _localData.Value = 42;
        Console.WriteLine(""ThreadLocal value for current thread: {0}"", _localData.Value);
    }
}

In this example, the ThreadLocal object is declared as a static variable, and the value of the ThreadLocal object can be accessed and modified using the Value property. The value of the ThreadLocal object is local to the current thread of execution, so different threads can have different values for the same ThreadLocal object."	eu.e002a7d6-5091-41d4-9da1-90c8fbf1bfc2				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63dfc7382ff0b42c19b7669b	00023de272--63dfaba86adb8b18a55bb1c8	00023de272--63dfc7382ff0b42c19b7669b	eecfce578ec8f52e1db33743c0b80f7f	APPROVED	2023-02-05T15:11:52.119	+

git stash apply, on the other hand, will reapply the stashed changes but leave the stash in your stash list. This means that the stash will remain stored in your repository, and you can reapply the changes later by using the git stash apply command again.

In summary, if you want to reapply the stashed changes and then drop the stash, use git stash pop. If you want to reapply the stashed changes and keep the stash, use git stash apply.

We are compiling an embedded C++ application that is deployed in a shielded device in an environment bombarded with ionizing radiation. We are using GCC and cross-compiling for ARM.

The hardware is designed for this environment, and our application has run on this platform for several years.

"	36827659	"There are several ways to address single event upsets (SEUs) in software when deploying in highly radioactive environments:

    Error Correction Codes (ECC): ECC is a powerful technique for detecting and correcting soft errors. You can implement ECC at the memory level, and also at the processor level. ECC can detect and correct many types of memory errors.

    Checkpoint/Restart: One way to handle SEUs is to periodically checkpoint the state of the application and restart it if an error is detected. This allows the application to continue running, even if there are errors.

    Code Hardening: Another way to reduce the effects of SEUs is to harden the code. This can be done by implementing techniques such as stack protection, address space randomization, and read-only data segments.

    Avoiding Dynamic Memory Allocation: Dynamic memory allocation can cause problems in an environment that is susceptible to SEUs. One way to reduce the effects of SEUs is to avoid dynamic memory allocation and use statically allocated memory instead.

    Use Robust Libraries: You can also use robust libraries that are designed to handle SEUs. For example, the Boost C++ Libraries include a number of libraries that are designed to handle SEUs, including a robust implementation of the standard C++ string class.

It's important to remember that no single solution is guaranteed to be effective in all cases, so a combination of the above approaches may be necessary. Additionally, it's important to thoroughly test your application in a simulated environment that emulates the effects of ionizing radiation to identify and address potential problems before deployment.

"What does T&& (double ampersand) mean in C++11?
I've been looking into some of the new features of C++11 and one I've noticed is the double ampersand in declaring variables, like T&& var.
For a start, what is this beast called? I wish Google would allow us to search for punctuation like this.
What exactly does it mean?
At first glance, it appears to be a double reference (like the C-style double pointers T** var), but I'm having a hard time thinking of a use case for that.
"	5481539	" C++11, T&& is called an rvalue reference. It's used to identify rvalue (temporary) objects, which can be optimized differently than lvalue (permanent) objects.

An rvalue reference provides a way to bind to temporary objects, allowing for more efficient transfer of resources, such as objects with dynamic memory allocation. The move constructor, for example, can be defined to take an rvalue reference as an argument, allowing it to transfer the ownership of a temporary object to a newly created object, rather than copying it.

In short, T&& is a useful tool in C++11 for improving performance and avoiding unnecessary copying of objects, especially for large and complex objects.

"What's the difference between UTF-8 and UTF-8 with BOM?
What's different between UTF-8 and UTF-8 with BOM? Which is better?
"	2223882	"UTF-8 is a character encoding that represents each character as a sequence of 1 to 4 bytes. It's the most widely used encoding for the Web and has become the dominant character encoding for the transfer of text data.

UTF-8 with BOM (Byte Order Mark) is the same as UTF-8, but it starts with the three-byte BOM sequence EF BB BF that serves as a marker for the start of the file and as an indicator of the byte order of the encoded characters.

There is no significant difference between UTF-8 and UTF-8 with BOM in terms of the representation of characters. The difference lies in the use of the BOM, which can be helpful in some cases but not necessary in others.

Whether UTF-8 or UTF-8 with BOM is better depends on the specific use case. In general, UTF-8 without the BOM is preferred, as it is more widely supported and less prone to issues with some software and programming languages. However, in some cases, such as Microsoft Windows, UTF-8 with BOM is required to ensure correct behavior.

    Run the following command: git rebase -i HEAD~<number_of_commits> where <number_of_commits> is the number of commits you want to squash.
    In the text editor that opens, replace the words ""pick"" next to the commits you want to squash with the word ""squash"".
    Save and close the text editor. Git will then reapply the changes from each of the squashed commits as a single combined commit.
    Force push the feature branch to the remote repository: git push -f origin feature.
    Now, you can merge the feature branch into the main branch using a normal merge.

Note: the -f option is used to force push the changes to the remote repository, which can overwrite existing history. Use this option with caution.

Collection was modified; enumeration operation may not execute
Below is the code.
This is a WCF server in a Windows service. The method NotifySubscribers() is called by the service whenever there is a data event (at random intervals, but not very often - about 800 times per day).

"	604831	"The error ""Collection was modified; enumeration operation may not execute"" occurs when you modify the collection being iterated over during a foreach loop.

In your code, you have the method UnsubscribeEvent that modifies the subscribers dictionary while the NotifySubscribers method is looping through it using a foreach loop.

To fix the issue, you need to make the subscribers dictionary thread-safe. One way to do this is by using a ConcurrentDictionary instead of a Dictionary, since ConcurrentDictionary provides thread-safe access to its elements. You can modify the code as follows:

csharp

private static ConcurrentDictionary<Guid, Subscriber> subscribers;
public SubscriptionServer()
{            
    subscribers = new ConcurrentDictionary<Guid, Subscriber>();
}

And when you want to iterate through the subscribers, use the Values property of the ConcurrentDictionary:

scss

foreach(Subscriber s in subscribers.Values)

This way, you can avoid the ""Collection was modified; enumeration operation may not execute"" error even if the subscribers dictionary is being modified by multiple threads simultaneously.

"Why should text files end with a newline?
I assume everyone here is familiar with the adage that all text files should end with a newline. I've known of this ""rule"" for years but I've always wondered — why?
"	729692	"The reason why text files should end with a newline is because of the way that text editors, utilities, and programming languages typically handle newlines.

Many text editors and utilities, such as cat on Unix-like systems, expect each line of a text file to be terminated with a newline character (\n). If a file does not end with a newline, then these tools may not display the final line of the file, or may display it in a way that is not intended.

In addition, many programming languages, such as Python, treat a newline as a separator between lines of text when reading from a file. If a text file does not end with a newline, then the last line of the file may not be processed correctly when it is read by a program.

Therefore, to ensure consistent and correct behavior across different text editors, utilities, and programming languages, it is a best practice to end all text files with a newline.

This made it difficult for software developers to write applications that could run on multiple Unix systems, since they had to take into account the differences between each system's APIs and user interfaces.

POSIX defines a standard set of system calls, library functions, and user interface conventions that must be supported by a Unix-like operating system in order to be considered POSIX-compliant. By providing a standard interface, POSIX allows software developers to write code that can be easily ported between different Unix systems, without having to worry about differences in system-specific APIs and user interfaces.

POSIX is important because it provides a way for developers to write portable, cross-platform software that can run on different Unix systems with minimal modification. This helps to reduce the cost of software development and maintain compatibility between different operating systems, which is important for users who need to run software on a variety of platforms.

"WebSockets vs. Server-Sent events/EventSource
Both WebSockets and Server-Sent Events are capable of pushing data to browsers. To me they seem to be competing technologies. What is the difference between them? When would you choose one over the other?
"	5195452	"WebSockets and Server-Sent Events (SSE) are both technologies that allow a server to push data to a client, but they have different use cases and design goals.

WebSockets are designed for real-time, two-way communication between a client and a server. They provide a full-duplex channel, meaning that data can be sent in both directions simultaneously, and they support a wider range of data types than SSE. WebSockets use a single, long-lived connection between the client and the server, and the connection remains open until either the client or the server closes it. This makes WebSockets suitable for use cases where low latency and high bandwidth are important, such as gaming, real-time chat, or financial data streaming.

Server-Sent Events, on the other hand, are designed for one-way communication from the server to the client, with a simple message-based API. SSE uses a text-based protocol that runs over a standard HTTP connection, which makes it easier to set up and use than WebSockets, especially in scenarios where firewalls or other security mechanisms block WebSockets connections. SSE connections are also designed to automatically reconnect if the connection is lost, making it more resilient than WebSockets in some scenarios. SSE is well suited for use cases where low latency is less important, such as sports updates, weather updates, or news feeds.

When choosing between WebSockets and Server-Sent Events, the most important factors to consider are the type of data you want to transmit, the amount of data you want to transmit, and the desired level of real-time interaction between the client and server. If you need low latency, high bandwidth, two-way communication, and support for binary data, then WebSockets may be the better choice. If you need simple one-way communication and don't need real-time interaction, then Server-Sent Events may be the better choice.

Here's my pg_hba.conf, my database.yml, and a dump of the full trace.

But they don't show up on pgadmin or even when I run sudo -u postgres psql -l.
Any idea where I'm going wrong?
"	18664074	"The error ""Peer authentication failed for user 'postgres'"" is typically caused by a misconfiguration in the PostgreSQL authentication settings. To resolve the issue, you need to make sure that the PostgreSQL server is configured to allow authentication for the user ""postgres"" and that the credentials in your Rails application's database.yml file are correct.

First, check your pg_hba.conf file to make sure that it's configured to allow authentication for the ""postgres"" user. Look for a line that specifies the authentication method for the ""postgres"" user, and make sure it's set to ""md5"". The line should look something like this:

sql

local   all         postgres                 md5

Next, check your database.yml file to make sure that the credentials for the ""postgres"" user are correct. Make sure that the ""username"" and ""password"" fields are set correctly for the ""production"" and ""development"" environments. The relevant sections of the file should look something like this:

yaml

production:
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  database: myapp_production
  username: postgres
  password: mypassword

development:
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  database: myapp_development
  username: postgres
  password: mypassword

If the settings in your pg_hba.conf and database.yml files are correct, but you're still encountering the error, you may need to restart the PostgreSQL server to apply the changes. On most systems, you can do this by running the following command:

sudo service postgresql restart

If the problem persists after restarting the server, try connecting to the PostgreSQL database using the psql client and specify the username and password on the command line.

"How can I undo git reset --hard HEAD~1?
Is it possible to undo the changes caused by the following command? If so, how?
git reset --hard HEAD~1
"	5473	"Unfortunately, when you use the git reset --hard command, the changes are permanently deleted from your repository and cannot be recovered. However, if you have made a backup of your repository or have a cloned copy, you can use that to recover the lost commits.

If you have not made a backup, you can use the git reflog command to see a list of all the previous values of the HEAD pointer and try to recover the lost commits from there.

Here is an example of how you can use git reflog to recover the lost commits:

    Run git reflog to see a list of all the previous values of the HEAD pointer.

    Find the hash of the commit that you want to recover and copy it.

    Run the following command to reset the HEAD pointer to the commit you want to recover:
    git reset --hard <commit_hash>

    Once you have reset the HEAD pointer, you can use the git log command to confirm that the lost commits have been recovered.

Note: This method is only possible if the reflog information has not been garbage collected.

    [] is an empty array, which when coerced to a number becomes 0. +[] is a unary operator that converts the value of its operand to a number, in this case, it becomes 0. So, +[0] is 0. And [0] is an array with one element, so ++[0] is 1.

    [+[]]: +[] is 0, so [0] is an array with one element.

    ++[[]][+[]] + [+[]]: Finally, 1 + [0] is 1 concatenated with [0], which becomes ""10"".

So, the expression ++[[]][+[]] + [+[]] evaluates to the string ""10"".

"How can I do 'insert if not exists' in MySQL?

I have a table with ~14 million records. If I want to add more data in the same format, is there a way to ensure the record I want to insert does not already exist without using a pair of queries (i.e., one query to check and one to insert is the result set is empty)?
Does a unique constraint on a field guarantee the insert will fail if it's already there?
It seems that with merely a constraint, when I issue the insert via PHP, the script croaks.
"	1361340	"To perform an ""insert if not exists"" in MySQL, you can use the following syntax:

sql

INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
SELECT 'value1', 'value2', 'value3', ...
FROM DUAL
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM table_name WHERE unique_column = 'value');

Here, you are trying to insert new values into the table_name if the values do not already exist in a specific column, unique_column. The SELECT statement is checking if the same values already exist, and if not, the values are inserted.

A unique constraint on a field will ensure that the insert will fail if the value you are trying to insert already exists in that field. However, if you are using PHP and the script is croaking, you may be encountering an error due to the insertion failing due to the constraint. To handle this, you can use try-catch blocks in your PHP code to catch the exception and handle it appropriately.

I've read various articles about mocking vs stubbing in testing, including Martin Fowler's Mocks Aren't Stubs, but still don't understand the difference.
"	3459287	"Mocks and stubs are both test doubles, or objects that simulate the behavior of other objects in a controlled way during testing. The main difference between them lies in their level of interactiveness and their intended use.

A stub is a test double that returns a pre-defined output when its methods are called, without actually checking the arguments passed to them or whether they are called the right number of times. Stubs are used to replace a real collaborator in a test, and to control the behavior of the system under test by returning hardcoded results.

A mock, on the other hand, is a more sophisticated test double that can verify whether its methods were called, in what order, and with what arguments. Mocks can also define expectations for the number of times a method should be called and raise an exception if those expectations are not met. Mocks are used to verify the interactions between the system under test and its collaborators.

In summary, stubs are used to control the behavior of the system under test, and mocks are used to verify the interactions between the system under test and its collaborators.

"What is an undefined reference/unresolved external symbol error and how do I fix it?
What are undefined reference/unresolved external symbol errors? What are common causes and how to fix/prevent them?
"	12573816	"An ""undefined reference"" or ""unresolved external symbol"" error is a common error in C and C++ programming when compiling and linking code. This error occurs when the compiler cannot find the definition of a symbol that is referenced in the code.

The most common causes of this error include:

    Missing function or variable definition: The symbol is declared in the code but its definition is not provided. This can occur if the definition is in a different source file and the required header file is not included or if the symbol is declared but not defined.

    Incorrect linking order: The libraries and object files are specified in the wrong order on the command line when linking the code. The linker must resolve symbols in the order in which the libraries and object files are specified, so it's important to list them in the correct order.

    Missing library or object file: A required library or object file is not specified on the command line when linking the code. The linker needs to be able to find the definition of all symbols referenced in the code.

    Incorrect library version: The wrong version of a library is linked with the code. The library version used must match the version that was used to compile the code.

To fix an undefined reference error, you need to identify the missing definition and ensure that it is provided. This may involve adding a header file, providing a function or variable definition, specifying a required library or object file on the command line, or linking a compatible version of the library.

Preventing undefined reference errors involves following good coding practices such as providing complete definitions for all symbols, including required header files, and specifying required libraries and object files on the command line. It's also a good idea to thoroughly test your code after making changes to ensure that all symbols are resolved correctly."	eu.781cd3df-60dd-4720-a575-14519b89914b				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63dfd5b1350cf706af65f37e	00023de272--63dfab8d6adb8b18a55ba8f5	00023de272--63dfd5b1350cf706af65f37e	eecfce578ec8f52e1db33743c0b80f7f	APPROVED	2023-02-05T16:13:37.607	+

"Easy interview question got harder: given numbers 1..100, find the missing number(s) given exactly k are missing
I had an interesting job interview experience a while back. The question started really easy:
Q1: We have a bag containing numbers 1, 2, 3, …, 100. Each number appears exactly once, so there are 100 numbers. Now one number is randomly picked out of the bag. Find the missing number.
I've heard this interview question before, of course, so I very quickly answered along the lines of:
A1: Well, the sum of the numbers 1 + 2 + 3 + … + N is (N+1)(N/2) (see Wikipedia: sum of arithmetic series). For N = 100, the sum is 5050.
Thus, if all numbers are present in the bag, the sum will be exactly 5050. Since one number is missing, the sum will be less than this, and the difference is that number. So we can find that missing number in O(N) time and O(1) space.
At this point I thought I had done well, but all of a sudden the question took an unexpected turn:
Q2: That is correct, but now how would you do this if TWO numbers are missing?
I had never seen/heard/considered this variation before, so I panicked and couldn't answer the question. The interviewer insisted on knowing my thought process, so I mentioned that perhaps we can get more information by comparing against the expected product, or perhaps doing a second pass after having gathered some information from the first pass, etc, but I really was just shooting in the dark rather than actually having a clear path to the solution.
The interviewer did try to encourage me by saying that having a second equation is indeed one way to solve the problem. At this point I was kind of upset (for not knowing the answer before hand), and asked if this is a general (read: ""useful"") programming technique, or if it's just a trick/gotcha answer.
The interviewer's answer surprised me: you can generalize the technique to find 3 missing numbers. In fact, you can generalize it to find k missing numbers.
Qk: If exactly k numbers are missing from the bag, how would you find it efficiently?
This was a few months ago, and I still couldn't figure out what this technique is.  Obviously there's a Ω(N) time lower bound since we must scan all the numbers at least once, but the interviewer insisted that the TIME and SPACE complexity of the solving technique (minus the O(N) time input scan) is defined in k not N.
So the question here is simple:
How would you solve Q2?
How would you solve Q3?
How would you solve Qk?
Clarifications
Generally there are N numbers from 1..N, not just 1..100.
I'm not looking for the obvious set-based solution, e.g. using a bit set, encoding the presence/absence each number by the value of a designated bit, therefore using O(N) bits in additional space. We can't afford any additional space proportional to N.
I'm also not looking for the obvious sort-first approach. This and the set-based approach are worth mentioning in an interview (they are easy to implement, and depending on N, can be very practical). I'm looking for the Holy Grail solution (which may or may not be practical to implement, but has the desired asymptotic characteristics nevertheless).
So again, of course you must scan the input in O(N), but you can only capture small amount of information (defined in terms of k not N), and must then find the k missing numbers somehow.
"	3492302	"One solution is to use the technique of Gaussian elimination to create a system of linear equations based on the sum and product of the numbers from 1 to N, with k unknowns representing the missing numbers. The system of linear equations can then be solved using matrix operations to find the missing numbers in time and space complexity defined in terms of k.

For Q2 (2 missing numbers), we can create a system of 2 linear equations based on the sum and product of the numbers from 1 to N:

    Sum of all numbers = (N+1)(N/2) - x - y
    Product of all numbers = (N!)/(N-k) = (N!)/(N-2) = x * y
    Where x and y are the missing numbers.

For Q3 (3 missing numbers), we can create a system of 3 linear equations based on the sum and product of the numbers from 1 to N:

    Sum of all numbers = (N+1)(N/2) - x - y - z
    Product of all numbers = (N!)/(N-k) = (N!)/(N-3) = x * y * z
    x + y + z = (N+1)(N/2) - (sum of remaining numbers)

For Qk (k missing numbers), we can extend this approach by creating a system of k linear equations and solving for the k unknowns using matrix operations.

Note that this technique requires a high level of mathematical proficiency and may not be practical for all interview situations. However, it provides a theoretical solution to the problem with the desired time and space complexity defined in terms of k."	eu.f7a190f3-b1f5-4eba-85dc-19f04a4fac10				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63dfd70b8820411c59f2f90e	00023de272--63dfab996adb8b18a55bad40	00023de272--63dfd70b8820411c59f2f90e	eecfce578ec8f52e1db33743c0b80f7f	APPROVED	2023-02-05T16:19:23.212	+

"Multiprocessing vs Threading Python
I am trying to understand the advantages of multiprocessing over threading. I know that multiprocessing gets around the Global Interpreter Lock, but what other advantages are there, and can threading not do the same thing?
"	3044580	"Multiprocessing and threading are both used in Python for parallel programming. Here are the key differences between them:

    Global Interpreter Lock (GIL): The GIL is a limitation of the CPython implementation of Python, which only allows one thread to execute at a time, even on multi-core systems. Multiprocessing avoids the GIL by creating separate processes, which run in parallel and have their own independent Python interpreter instances. On the other hand, threading is affected by the GIL and cannot fully utilize the processing power of multi-core systems.

    Resource Usage: Each process created by the multiprocessing module has its own memory space, which means that it can consume more memory compared to threads. However, because each process runs in its own memory space, it is more robust and less likely to crash due to memory errors.

    Synchronization: Threads can communicate and share data through shared memory, making synchronization easier. In contrast, communication between processes in multiprocessing is more difficult, and typically involves inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms such as pipes or queues.

    Blocking I/O: Threading can block the entire process when it performs blocking I/O operations, such as waiting for a network response. On the other hand, multiprocessing can still perform other tasks during blocking I/O operations, as each process runs independently.

In general, multiprocessing is recommended for CPU-bound tasks and for tasks that are not affected by the GIL, while threading is recommended for I/O-bound tasks and for tasks that can benefit from shared memory and easy synchronization.

"Why do Python classes inherit object?
Why does the following class declaration inherit from object?
class MyClass(object):
    ...
"	4015417	"In Python 2, the class object was introduced as the base class for all classes, and it became the default parent class for new-style classes. The object class provided several important features that were not present in the older, ""classic"" classes, such as support for new-style class mechanisms like descriptors, properties, and special methods like __getattribute__ and __setattr__.

So, by declaring a class as class MyClass(object), you are explicitly specifying that the class is a new-style class that inherits from the object class and gains all its benefits. In Python 3, all classes implicitly inherit from object, so the explicit inheritance from object is not necessary.

In conclusion, declaring a class as class MyClass(object) is a way to ensure that the class is a new-style class, and to take advantage of the new-style class features provided by the object class."	eu.62483f5b-ed68-4e82-8708-4b02bd6ccf8f				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63dff7a32ff0b42c19bda80e	00023de272--63dfab916adb8b18a55baa32	00023de272--63dff7a32ff0b42c19bda80e	eecfce578ec8f52e1db33743c0b80f7f	APPROVED	2023-02-05T18:38:27.012	+

In the editor, change the first commit from pick to squash, save, and exit the editor. Git will then try to squash the two commits into one. If it succeeds, you can use git rebase --continue to complete the rebase.

If you still encounter errors, you may need to force a new branch and apply your changes there:

git branch new_branch
git checkout new_branch

You can then make your changes to this new branch and merge it back into your main branch once it is in a good state.

"Undefined behavior and sequence points
What are ""sequence points""?
What is the relation between undefined behaviour and sequence points?
I often use funny and convoluted expressions like a[++i] = i;, to make myself feel better. Why should I stop using them?
If you've read this, be sure to visit the follow-up question Undefined behavior and sequence points reloaded.
(Note: This is meant to be an entry to Stack Overflow's C++ FAQ. If you want to critique the idea of providing an FAQ in this form, then the posting on meta that started all this would be the place to do that. Answers to that question are monitored in the C++ chatroom, where the FAQ idea started out in the first place, so your answer is very likely to get read by those who came up with the idea.)
"	4176328	"Sequence points"" in C++ refer to specific points in the evaluation of expressions where the order of execution of subexpressions is guaranteed to be fixed. This means that, at a sequence point, all side effects of previously evaluated subexpressions will have taken place, and all objects modified by those subexpressions will have their updated values.

The relation between undefined behavior and sequence points is that undefined behavior can result from violating the rules surrounding sequence points. For example, if you modify an object more than once between two sequence points, the behavior of the program is undefined. Another example is if you access an object after it has been destroyed.

It's best to avoid using funny and convoluted expressions like a[++i] = i; because they can easily result in undefined behavior. This is because such expressions can modify an object multiple times between sequence points, which is a violation of the rules surrounding sequence points. Using such expressions can make your code difficult to understand and maintain, and can lead to subtle bugs that are difficult to debug. Instead, it's recommended to use straightforward and easily understood expressions."	eu.e86c273f-a0cc-429f-9148-b38dc618b60e				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63dff9046adb8b18a565441f	00023de272--63dfaba06adb8b18a55baf6f	00023de272--63dff9046adb8b18a565441f	eecfce578ec8f52e1db33743c0b80f7f	APPROVED	2023-02-05T18:44:20.127	+

"How do I check in SQLite whether a table exists?
How do I, reliably, check in SQLite, whether a particular user table exists?
I am not asking for unreliable ways like checking if a ""select *"" on the table returned an error or not (is this even a good idea?).
The reason is like this:
In my program, I need to create and then populate some tables if they do not exist already.
If they do already exist, I need to update some tables.
Should I take some other path instead to signal that the tables in question have already been created - say for example, by creating/putting/setting a certain flag in my program initialization/settings file on disk or something?
Or does my approach make sense?

sql

SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' AND name='table_name';

If the query returns a row, then the table exists. If it doesn't, the table does not exist.

Using the ""sqlite_master"" table is considered a reliable way to check for the existence of a table.

"Difference between == and === in JavaScript
What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript?  I have also seen != and !== operators.  Are there more such operators?
"	523643	"In JavaScript, == (double equal) and === (triple equal) are comparison operators that compare values for equality.

The difference between == and === is that == performs type coercion before the comparison, meaning that it will attempt to convert the values being compared to a common type. For example, '5' == 5 would evaluate to true because the string '5' is automatically converted to the number 5 before the comparison.

On the other hand, === does not perform type coercion and only returns true if both values being compared are of the same type and have the same value. For example, '5' === 5 would evaluate to false.

!= (not equal) and !== (not equal value or not equal type) are the negated forms of == and ===, respectively.

Other comparison operators in JavaScript include:

    > (greater than)
    < (less than)
    >= (greater than or equal to)
    <= (less than or equal to)
    Object.is() (a way to compare values for equality, similar to ===, but with some differences, such as handling special values like NaN correctly)

The key prop is used by React to identify each element in an array of children, so that it can update efficiently. Since each td element should be unique, it needs to have a unique key. In this case, you are using the same data property of this.props.data[c] as the key for all td elements, which will result in all of the td elements having the same key.

You need to use a unique key for each td element. One way to do this is to add a unique index to the key:

return <td key={this.props.data[c] + index}>{this.props.data[c]}</td>;

where index is the index of the element in the map function.

function factorial(n, result = 1) {
  if (n === 1) {
    return result;
  }
  return factorial(n - 1, n * result);
}

In this example, the factorial function is called with a new n and result on each iteration until n reaches 1, and each call returns the result of the next call, making it a tail call. JavaScript does not have TCO, so the stack will continue to grow with each call, potentially leading to a stack overflow.

On the other hand, here's an example of a function that's not a tail call:

scss

function factorial(n) {
  if (n === 1) {
    return 1;
  }
  return n * factorial(n - 1);
}

In this example, the call to factorial is not the last thing the function does before returning, so it's not a tail call and the stack will continue to grow with each call.

Languages like Scheme and Lua have TCO, allowing for efficient implementation of recursive algorithms. However, most mainstream programming languages like JavaScript, Python, and Java do not have TCO.

"What is the meaning of single and double underscore before an object name?
What do single and double leading underscores before an object's name represent in Python?
"	1301346	"In Python, a single leading underscore (e.g. _object) is used as a naming convention to indicate that the object is intended to be private. This means it should not be directly accessed from outside the class. However, it is not actually enforced and can still be accessed if desired.

A double leading underscore (e.g. __object) triggers the name mangling mechanism in Python. This means the object's name is altered in a way that makes it harder to accidentally access from outside the class. The name is transformed by adding a prefix that is based on the name of the class. For example, __object in a class named MyClass would become _MyClass__object. This makes it harder to accidentally access the object from outside the class, but it can still be accessed if desired by using the mangled name.

"How and when to use ‘async’ and ‘await’
From my understanding one of the main things that async and await do is to make code easy to write and read - but is using them equal to spawning background threads to perform long duration logic?
I'm currently trying out the most basic example. I've added some comments inline. Can you clarify it for me?
// I don't understand why this method must be marked as `async`.
private async void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    Task<int> access = DoSomethingAsync();
    // task independent stuff here
    // this line is reached after the 5 seconds sleep from 
    // DoSomethingAsync() method. Shouldn't it be reached immediately? 
    int a = 1; 
    // from my understanding the waiting should be done here.
    int x = await access; 
}
async Task<int> DoSomethingAsync()
{
    // is this executed on a background thread?
    System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(5000);
    return 1;
}
"	14455293	"The async keyword before the method definition indicates that the method contains asynchronous operations, which can be executed concurrently with other operations.

In the code example, DoSomethingAsync() is an asynchronous method that returns a Task<int> and is executed with the await keyword. await is used to wait for an asynchronous operation to complete before continuing execution of the code.

System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(5000) will cause the method to sleep for 5 seconds, simulating a long-duration operation, such as reading data from a network. When the method returns, it signals that the asynchronous operation is complete and the result can be retrieved.

In this example, the await keyword causes the button1_Click method to wait for the result of DoSomethingAsync before assigning the result to x. However, this does not mean that the program is blocked or stopped during the wait. Instead, the program is free to execute other code while DoSomethingAsync is running.

It's worth noting that while System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(5000) runs on the current thread, it is not guaranteed that the method is executed on a background thread. The .NET runtime uses its own thread pool to manage the execution of asynchronous methods and determine the best way to run them, which may include using background threads, worker threads, or other techniques.

Advantages:
Flexible: easy to add, remove, or modify elements.
Efficient: fast to iterate over and access elements.
Disadvantages:
Takes up more memory: Lists use more memory than tuples due to their dynamic size and the fact they have additional methods.
Tuples:

Immutable: once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed.
Represented by parentheses ()
Do not have methods for adding/removing elements (as they are immutable)

"How do function pointers in C work?
I had some experience lately with function pointers in C.
So going on with the tradition of answering your own questions, I decided to make a small summary of the very basics, for those who need a quick dive-in to the subject.
"	840501	"Function pointers in C are pointers that point to the address of a function in memory, instead of pointing to the data stored in a variable. They allow you to pass a function as an argument to another function, or assign it to a variable. Function pointers are declared with the syntax:

php

<return_type> (*<pointer_name>)(<parameter_types>)

For example, to declare a function pointer that points to a function that takes two integers as arguments and returns an integer, you would use:

csharp

int (*add)(int, int);

To assign a function to a function pointer, you simply use the function's name without the parenthesis:

python

add = &sum;

And to call the function through the function pointer, you use the pointer name with parenthesis:

scss

result = (*add)(10, 20);

Function pointers in C can be used for various purposes such as implementing callback functions, providing a more flexible way to handle function calls, and creating function-based data structures.

When using super() in a class, it refers to the parent class in the method resolution order. For example, in the case of Third(First, Second), the MRO is [Third, First, Second, object]. When super().__init__() is called in the Third class, it first refers to the parent class in the MRO, which is First. If First doesn't have an implementation for __init__, the search continues to the next parent class, which is Second, and so on.

Also, during the preparation of MediaRecorder or MediaPlayer if a problem happens then I'll close this activity.

Intent resultIntent = new Intent();
resultIntent.putExtra(""result"", result);

"Difference between ""wait()"" vs ""sleep()"" in Java
What is the difference between a wait() and sleep() in Threads?
Is my understanding that a wait()-ing Thread is still in running mode and uses CPU cycles but a sleep()-ing does not consume any CPU cycles correct?
Why do we have both wait() and sleep()?
How does their implementation vary at a lower level?
"	1036754	"The wait() and sleep() methods in Java serve similar but distinct purposes.

sleep() is a static method of the Thread class that causes the currently executing thread to pause for a specified amount of time, without releasing any locks it may hold. The thread continues to consume CPU cycles while it is sleeping.

wait() is an instance method of the Object class that releases the lock on the object and causes the current thread to wait until another thread calls notify() or notifyAll() on the same object. The waiting thread consumes no CPU cycles while it is waiting.

wait() and notify() are intended to be used for inter-thread communication, allowing one thread to wait for another thread to perform a specific action. sleep() is used to pause the current thread for a specified amount of time, without any synchronization with other threads.

In general, it's recommended to use sleep() if you want to pause a thread for a specified amount of time, and to use wait() and notify() for inter-thread communication.

"Use of PUT vs PATCH methods in REST API real life scenarios
First of all, some definitions:
PUT is defined in Section 9.6 RFC 2616:
The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers to an already existing resource, the enclosed entity SHOULD be considered as a modified version of the one residing on the origin server. If the Request-URI does not point to an existing resource, and that URI is capable of being defined as a new resource by the requesting user agent, the origin server can create the resource with that URI.
PATCH is defined in RFC 5789:
The PATCH method requests that a set of changes described in the
request entity be applied to the resource identified by the Request-
URI.
Also according to RFC 2616 Section 9.1.2 PUT is Idempotent while PATCH is not.
Now let us take a look at a real example. When I do POST to /users with the data {username: 'skwee357', email: 'skwee357@domain.example'} and the server is capable of creating a resource, it will respond with 201 and resource location (lets assume /users/1) and any next call to GET /users/1 will return {id: 1, username: 'skwee357', email: 'skwee357@domain.example'}.
Now let us say I want to modify my email. Email modification is considered ""a set of changes"" and therefore I should PATCH /users/1 with ""patch document"". In my case it would be the JSON document: {email: 'skwee357@newdomain.example'}. The server then returns 200 (assuming permission are ok). This brings me to first question:
PATCH is NOT idempotent. It said so in RFC 2616 and RFC 5789. However if I issue the same PATCH request (with my new email), I will get the same resource state (with my email being modified to the requested value). Why is PATCH not then idempotent?
PATCH is a relatively new verb (RFC introduced in March 2010), and it comes to solve the problem of ""patching"" or modifying a set of fields. Before PATCH was introduced, everybody used PUT to update resources. But after PATCH was introduced, it leaves me confused about what PUT is used for. And this brings me to my second (and the main) question:
What is the real difference between PUT and PATCH? I have read somewhere that PUT might be used to replace entire entity under specific resource, so one should send the full entity (instead of set of attributes as with PATCH). What is the real practical usage for such case? When would you like to replace / overwrite an entity at a specific resource URI and why is such an operation not considered updating / patching the entity? The only practical use case I see for PUT is issuing a PUT on a collection, i.e. /users to replace the entire collection. Issuing PUT on a specific entity makes no sense after PATCH was introduced. Am I wrong?
"	28459418	The main difference between PUT and PATCH is the scope of the update to the resource. PUT is used to replace the entire resource identified by the URI, while PATCH is used to make a set of updates to a resource. PATCH updates are expressed as a set of differences from the current resource state, while PUT requires the entire resource state to be included in the request. In practice, PUT is used for resource creation or replacement when the full resource state is available and PATCH is used for updating a resource when only partial updates are needed. However, it is important to note that PUT is idempotent, meaning multiple identical PUT requests will result in the same resource state, while PATCH is not idempotent as multiple requests may result in different resource states.	eu.01dacc37-4b75-4ac3-80ff-f00a328c3461				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e012cf94e8c602a9702120	00023de272--63dfab9c6adb8b18a55bae3b	00023de272--63e012cf94e8c602a9702120	51c1a4b90d1121c9e2b052896226136d	APPROVED	2023-02-05T20:34:23.004	+

"What does 'synchronized' mean?
I have some questions regarding the usage and significance of the synchronized keyword. 
What is the significance of the synchronized keyword?
When should methods be synchronized?
What does it mean programmatically and logically?
"	1085709	"""Synchronized"" is a keyword in Java that is used to control access to shared resources in a multithreaded environment. The significance of the synchronized keyword is to ensure that only one thread at a time can execute the method or block of code annotated with ""synchronized"".

Methods should be synchronized when they access shared resources or shared data that may cause an inconsistent state if accessed concurrently by multiple threads.

Programmatically, the synchronized keyword can be used to declare a method or a block of code as a critical section. The JVM will enforce mutual exclusion on the critical section, meaning that only one thread can execute it at a time. Logically, it ensures that the critical section remains consistent and free from race conditions even in the presence of multiple threads."	eu.0338d1fe-acab-4c93-82dd-685cf86988b7				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e0140ee0fa77410119c3d5	00023de272--63dfab9e6adb8b18a55baeba	00023de272--63e0140ee0fa77410119c3d5	51c1a4b90d1121c9e2b052896226136d	APPROVED	2023-02-05T20:39:42.248	+

Now I'm looking into calling these async methods from sync methods.

    // Asynchronous method body

public void Bar()

Note that using Wait blocks the calling thread until the asynchronous method Foo completes. If you need to perform other work while waiting for the asynchronous method to complete, you can use the Task.WhenAny method.

Also, it is important to note that the use of async void should be avoided in most cases, as it can make it difficult to handle exceptions and it doesn't allow the caller to wait for the completion of the asynchronous operation. A better approach is to use async Task and return the Task object to the caller, which can then use the await keyword or the .Wait method to wait for the asynchronous operation to complete."	eu.8d5c6949-6d49-4279-8a62-6c60500b6619				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e01421ad7a1656d931222f	00023de272--63dfab996adb8b18a55bad44	00023de272--63e01421ad7a1656d931222f	e94a0e4a9bc57c10ae8b01b0d910b306	APPROVED	2023-02-05T20:40:01.281	+

"Function vs. Stored Procedure in SQL Server
When should I use a function rather than a stored procedure in SQL, and vice versa? What is the purpose of each?
"	1179758	"In SQL Server, a stored procedure is a pre-compiled, reusable piece of code that can accept input parameters and perform one or more database operations. Stored procedures are typically used to perform complex, data-centric tasks that are executed frequently, such as data validation, data manipulation, and data retrieval.

A function, on the other hand, is a subroutine that can be used in a SELECT statement. Functions in SQL Server can be either scalar (returns a single value) or table-valued (returns a table). Functions are used to encapsulate a small, well-defined piece of logic that can be reused throughout an application.

In general, you should use a stored procedure when you need to perform a series of database operations, or when you want to encapsulate complex business logic in the database. On the other hand, you should use a function when you need to return a single value or a table based on a set of input parameters.

It is also important to note that stored procedures have the potential to run faster than functions because they are pre-compiled, and they can also provide a higher level of security by reducing the surface area for attackers. However, functions can be easier to maintain and debug, because they are typically less complex than stored procedures."	eu.2780b2e7-8342-45fd-a1fa-ecbc5905c136				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e0159a2ff0b42c19c1b83c	00023de272--63dfaba86adb8b18a55bb1cc	00023de272--63e0159a2ff0b42c19c1b83c	e94a0e4a9bc57c10ae8b01b0d910b306	APPROVED	2023-02-05T20:46:18.025	+

"	8554043	"A clearfix is a CSS technique used to clear the float property of an element, so that its child elements do not wrap around the floated element but instead appear below it. This is particularly useful when creating multi-column layouts, as it ensures that the columns have equal heights and no overlapping content.

An example of a layout with a clearfix could be a three-column layout, where each column has a float property set to left. Without a clearfix, the parent container may not contain the floated columns, and the footer would appear alongside the floated columns. However, by using a clearfix on the parent container, the parent container will properly contain the floated columns and the footer will appear below them.

Here's an example of a clearfix:

"String formatting: % vs. .format vs. f-string literal

If you are trying to close a duplicate question that is just looking for a way to format a string, please use How do I put a variable’s value inside a string?.
"	5082452	"All three methods are used for string formatting in Python, but each has its own advantages and disadvantages.

""Hello %s"" % name (Python < 2.6): This method uses string formatting with % operator and is the oldest way to format strings in Python. It is simple to use, but its syntax can be confusing, especially when formatting multiple values.

""Hello {}"".format(name) (Python 2.6+): This method uses str.format() and provides a more readable and flexible way to format strings compared to % operator. Named arguments can also be used, making it easier to keep track of the format specification.

f""Hello {name}"" (Python 3.6+): This method uses f-string literals and is the newest way to format strings in Python. It provides the same flexibility as str.format() with the added benefit of being more readable and having a performance advantage in certain cases.

In terms of performance, f-strings are generally faster than the other two methods, but the difference is negligible for small strings. The real difference in performance comes from the number of times the string is formatted. If a string is formatted once, all three methods have similar performance. However, if a string is formatted multiple times, f-strings will be faster.

In conclusion, it depends on the individual's preference and the context in which the string is being formatted. If readability and ease of use are more important, str.format() or f-strings are the better choices.

To calculate or approximate the Big O complexity of an algorithm, you can:

Analyze the algorithm's mathematical model and look for terms that grow the fastest as n increases. The term with the highest degree is the leading term, and it determines the overall growth rate of the algorithm's running time.

Measure the running time of the algorithm for different input sizes and plot the results on a graph. If the graph shows a clear trend, you can use regression analysis to fit a curve to the data and estimate the Big O complexity.

Inspect the algorithm's source code and count the number of operations it performs. This can be used to identify the dominant term in the mathematical model and estimate the Big O complexity.

Regardless of the approach you take, it's important to keep in mind that Big O notation provides an upper bound on the running time, so the actual running time of an algorithm might be faster."	eu.ea8afb12-d6a4-4175-a775-97967c1fdfc8				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e01fe1ad7a1656d931e720	00023de272--63dfaba86adb8b18a55bb1b3	00023de272--63e01fe1ad7a1656d931e720	e94a0e4a9bc57c10ae8b01b0d910b306	APPROVED	2023-02-05T21:30:09.190	+

I tried to run docker-compose run containername ls -la, but that didn't do anything.

"	30172605	"You can use the docker exec command to get into a Docker container's shell. The basic syntax is as follows:

python
Copy code
docker exec -it <container-name/container-id> bash
Replace <container-name/container-id> with the name or ID of the container you want to get into. The -it options allow you to interact with the container's terminal. The final bash runs a bash shell inside the container.

For example, if your container name is wordpress_web, you would run the following command:

python
Copy code
docker exec -it wordpress_web bash
This will open up a shell inside the WordPress container, allowing you to traverse the directory structure and inspect files."	eu.6392bae1-3992-4563-930b-b28c7790c002				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e032f4405a38476b80a14e	00023de272--63dfab846adb8b18a55ba72b	00023de272--63e032f4405a38476b80a14e	d8e61a54e640dc786924fbd68be12067	APPROVED	2023-02-05T22:51:32.111	+

Muhammad Tousiq
Why don't self-closing script elements work?
What is the reason browsers do not correctly recognize:
<script src=""foobar.js"" /> <!-- self-closing script element -->
Only this is recognized:
<script src=""foobar.js""></script>
Does this break the concept of XHTML support?
Note: This statement is correct at least for all IE (6-8 beta 2).

Self-closing script elements are not recognized by browsers because the syntax is not part of the HTML specification. The HTML specification only allows script elements to have a closing tag, as in <script src=""foobar.js""></script>. The self-closing syntax is used in XML, but not in HTML.

Using the self-closing syntax would not break the concept of XHTML support because XHTML requires all elements to be properly closed, either with a closing tag or self-closing syntax. However, since Internet Explorer does not support the self-closing syntax for script elements, it would not be compatible with older versions of Internet Explorer."	eu.e0fa2ee1-ed72-4899-b5b1-d21605958cf2				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e05420e0fa7741011dc334	00023de272--63dfab936adb8b18a55bab16	00023de272--63e05420e0fa7741011dc334	3588b7726e48388a2b8a3e76f71466fc	APPROVED	2023-02-06T01:13:04.461	+

"	448673	"Emulators work by mimicking the behavior of a specific hardware platform, typically by running software on a general-purpose computer that resembles the original platform as closely as possible. To emulate a game system, the emulator must:

1. Emulate the CPU: The emulator must interpret the assembly instructions of the original platform's CPU and execute them as the original platform would.

2. Emulate the GPU: The emulator must render the graphics output of the original platform, typically by translating the original platform's graphics commands into modern graphics API calls.

3. Emulate the I/O subsystem: The emulator must handle input and output, such as controllers or disk drives, by translating them into equivalent input and output calls on the host platform.

4. Emulate the memory subsystem: The emulator must provide the same memory map and memory access behavior as the original platform.

To write an emulator, a good starting point is to understand the architecture and behavior of the original platform and its components.

"What are C++ functors and their uses?
I keep hearing a lot about functors in C++. Can someone give me an overview as to what they are and in what cases they would be useful?
"	356950	"A functor, also known as a function object, in C++ is an object that behaves like a function. It can be called with the same syntax as a function, but can also store and manipulate data. This allows functors to be used as arguments to algorithms, to store state, and to provide encapsulation of a computation.

Functors are defined by creating a class that overrides the operator(). The operator() can be overloaded to specify the behavior of the functor.

Functors are useful in cases where a function pointer is not flexible enough, such as when you want to pass data to a function, or when you need to store state that can be used across multiple calls. For example, a functor can be used to compare two objects, to sort a container, to manipulate elements of an array, or to define an action that is performed on an element of a container."	eu.70081339-9e43-49dc-9dfa-7f540033f6e5				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e080d0461aef4dec07e888	00023de272--63dfaba16adb8b18a55bafc7	00023de272--63e080d0461aef4dec07e888	83d988a52fa2bd6e493ca96570078679	APPROVED	2023-02-06T04:23:44.533	+	
"How do I undo 'git reset'?
I want to undo this command:
git reset HEAD~
"	2510276	"To undo the 'git reset' command, you can use the 'git reflog' command to find the SHA-1 value of the previous commit, and then use the 'git reset' command with the 'HEAD' option and the SHA-1 value to reset the repository to the previous state. For example:

$ git reflog
# find the commit hash before resetting
$ git reset HEAD@{number_of_the_commit}
# where number_of_the_commit is the number of the commit before the reset

You can also use 'git reflog' to find the commit hash, and then use the 'git cherry-pick' command with the SHA-1 value to apply the changes from that commit to the current branch. For example:

$ git reflog
# find the commit hash before resetting
$ git cherry-pick {commit_hash}

"	5834014	"""LF"" and ""CRLF"" are end-of-line (EOL) markers used in text files.

""LF"" stands for Line Feed and represents a new line on Unix-based systems (such as Linux or macOS).
""CRLF"" stands for Carriage Return Line Feed and represents a new line on Windows-based systems.
The warnings you are receiving indicate that Git is converting the line endings of your text files from the original format (LF or CRLF) to the format specified in your Git configuration (core.autocrlf). This may cause problems if the files are shared between systems with different EOL formats.

To resolve the warnings, you can either configure Git to keep the original line endings (by setting core.autocrlf to false), or convert the line endings to the desired format (by setting core.autocrlf to true or input).

It is important to override the 'GetHashCode' method when you override the 'Equals' method because the 'GetHashCode' is used as a key in hash-based collections, such as dictionaries and hash sets. When two objects are equal, they should also have the same hash code. If the hash codes are different for equal objects, the hash-based collections might not work correctly and you might not be able to retrieve the objects properly.

"Custom HTTP headers : naming conventions
Several of our users have asked us to include data relative to their account in the HTTP headers of requests we send them, or even responses they get from our API.
What is the general convention to add custom HTTP headers, in terms of naming, format... etc.
Also, feel free to post any smart usage of these that you stumbled upon on the web; We're trying to implement this using what's best out there as a target :)
"	3561381	"

The naming convention for custom HTTP headers is to prefix the header name with ""X-"" to indicate that it is a non-standard header. The header name should be composed of only US-ASCII characters, and the header value can contain any character.

A common use case for custom HTTP headers is to pass authentication information, such as an API key or a bearer token, to the server. Another use case is to include metadata about the request or response, such as the version of the API being used or the encoding applied to the data.

It's important to note that custom headers should not be used to pass sensitive information, as they are not encrypted and can be easily seen by an attacker who has access to network traffic. For sensitive information, use secure and standard mechanisms, such as SSL/TLS encryption or standard HTTP headers like ""Authorization""."	eu.ecef0f2a-17d6-4ba7-b4cf-6308a309b3c1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e089c9aff36b55e4027117	00023de272--63dfab946adb8b18a55bab79	00023de272--63e089c9aff36b55e4027117	69ac9e9ef4bf0b8c8b083d7e212aa393	APPROVED	2023-02-06T05:02:01.795	+

Open the storyboard and make sure that the UILabel with the ""XXX"" key actually exists in your interface.

"Passing data between view controllers
I'm new to iOS and Objective-C and the whole MVC paradigm and I'm stuck with the following:
I have a view that acts as a data entry form and I want to give the user the option to select multiple products. The products are listed on another view with a UITableViewController and I have enabled multiple selections.
How do I transfer the data from one view to another? I will be holding the selections on the UITableView in an array, but how do I then pass that back to the previous data entry form view so it can be saved along with the other data to Core Data on submission of the form?

What would be the correct way of performing this and how would I go about it?
"	5210535	"There are several ways to pass data between view controllers in iOS:

1- Properties: You can define properties in the destination view controller that will store the data. Then, before presenting the destination view controller, you can set those properties to the data you want to pass. Finally, you can access those properties in the destination view controller to get the passed data.

2- Delegate pattern: You can define a delegate protocol in the destination view controller and have the source view controller implement that protocol. You can then pass the source view controller as the delegate to the destination view controller when it is presented. In the destination view controller, you can call delegate methods to pass the data back to the source view controller.

3- Singleton: You can create a singleton class that stores the data. You can then access the singleton from both view controllers to get or set the data.

4- Notification center: You can use the NSNotificationCenter to post a notification that contains the data. The source view controller can post the notification and the destination view controller can observe the notification to receive the data.

Out of these options, using properties or the delegate pattern is recommended in most cases.

As for creating a data model, it's a good idea to encapsulate your data in model objects and store these objects in a persistent store like Core Data. These model objects should represent the entities in your application, like products in this case, and should contain the data that's required to display the products. This makes it easier to manage your data and separate the data from the user interface."	eu.e9c2c390-e7d7-41b5-a6b2-3c96ca1603ad				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e0935a1293785987e561ef	00023de272--63dfab936adb8b18a55bab25	00023de272--63e0935a1293785987e561ef	c32e67a609f17871837bd42a8aa41596	APPROVED	2023-02-06T05:42:50.018	+

"What are the rules about using an underscore in a C++ identifier?
It's common in C++ to name member variables with some kind of prefix to denote the fact that they're member variables, rather than local variables or parameters. If you've come from an MFC background, you'll probably use m_foo. I've also seen myFoo occasionally.
C# (or possibly just .NET) seems to recommend using just an underscore, as in _foo. Is this allowed by the C++ standard?
"	228783	"In C++, the use of an underscore as the first character in an identifier is allowed, but it is not recommended. The use of an underscore as the first character of an identifier is reserved for the implementation. According to the C++ standard, identifiers that start with an underscore followed by a capital letter (e.g. _Foo) are also reserved. So, it is safer to not use an underscore as the first character in a C++ identifier.

Instead, the C++ naming convention is to use a lowercase letter followed by camel case (e.g. fooBar) for variable names and uppercase letters separated by underscores (e.g. FOO_BAR) for macro definitions."	eu.2824f7f8-fb1c-4ec4-b1f9-253d0e2e2886				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e096cf1293785987e5b5c0	00023de272--63dfaba26adb8b18a55bb012	00023de272--63e096cf1293785987e5b5c0	c32e67a609f17871837bd42a8aa41596	APPROVED	2023-02-06T05:57:35.378	+	
"How to make vim paste from (and copy to) system's clipboard?
Unlike other editors, vim stores copied text in its own clipboard. So, it's very hard for me to copy some text from a webpage and paste it into the current working file. It so happens I have to either open gedit or type it manually.
Can I make vim paste from and to the system's clipboard?
"	11489428	"Yes, you can make vim paste from and copy to the system's clipboard by installing a Vim plugin like vim-gtk or vim-gnome if you're using Linux and have gtk or gnome libraries installed. These plugins allow vim to interact with the system clipboard.

If you're using macOS, you can use the vim-mac library, which provides clipboard support.

Alternatively, you can configure Vim to use xclip, which is a command-line utility that allows copying and pasting to the system clipboard. You can install xclip and add the following to your Vim configuration file:

sql

"" copy to system clipboard
set clipboard=unnamedplus

"" paste from system clipboard
vmap <C-v> ""+gP
nmap <C-v> ""+p
After adding these settings, you can copy text to the system clipboard using ""+y, and paste from the system clipboard using <C-v>."	eu.bacbd01c-b4b1-463f-a8f6-cf6c64cdd82d				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e0970caff36b55e4038c51	00023de272--63dfaba36adb8b18a55bb05d	00023de272--63e0970caff36b55e4038c51	c32e67a609f17871837bd42a8aa41596	APPROVED	2023-02-06T05:58:36.592	+

"How to insert an element after another element in JavaScript without using a library?
There's insertBefore() in JavaScript, but how can I insert an element after another element without using jQuery or another library?
"	4793604	"In JavaScript, you can insert an element after another element using the insertAdjacentElement method. The insertAdjacentElement method allows you to insert an element relative to another element in the DOM.

Here's an example:

javascript

const newElement = document.createElement('div');
newElement.innerHTML = 'This is a new element';

const referenceElement = document.getElementById('reference-element');
referenceElement.insertAdjacentElement('afterend', newElement);
In this example, the insertAdjacentElement method is used to insert the newElement after the referenceElement. The first argument to the method is a string that specifies the position relative to the referenceElement where the newElement should be inserted. In this case, the string 'afterend' is used to insert the newElement immediately after the referenceElement.

Alternatively, you could use the nextSibling property to insert an element after another element:

javascript

const newElement = document.createElement('div');
newElement.innerHTML = 'This is a new element';

const referenceElement = document.getElementById('reference-element');
referenceElement.parentNode.insertBefore(newElement, referenceElement.nextSibling);
In this example, the nextSibling property of the referenceElement is used to insert the newElement immediately after the referenceElement.

This seems to be a limitation in other languages too.  Why is this such a problem?
"	92396	The reason you cannot declare variables within a case statement in many programming languages is because of the way the switch statement is executed. The switch statement selects a block of code to execute based on the value of the switch expression. Declaring a variable inside of the case statement would change the scope of that variable, which would make it unavailable outside of the switch statement. This would make it difficult for the compiler to determine if the variable has been declared elsewhere in the code and would potentially lead to naming conflicts and other problems. To avoid these issues, most programming languages simply disallow declaring variables within a case statement and require you to declare them before the switch statement begins.	eu.83df4e30-f496-4691-8780-0cb3715c36dc				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e09b0d1293785987e61d4e	00023de272--63dfab9e6adb8b18a55baee1	00023de272--63e09b0d1293785987e61d4e	c32e67a609f17871837bd42a8aa41596	APPROVED	2023-02-06T06:15:41.008	+	
"Loop inside React JSX
I'm trying to do something like the following in React JSX (where ObjectRow is a separate component):

"Deleting array elements in JavaScript - delete vs splice
What is the difference between using the delete operator on the array element as opposed to using the Array.splice method? 
For example:
myArray = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'];
delete myArray[1];
//  or
myArray.splice (1, 1);
Why even have the splice method if I can delete array elements like I can with objects?
"	500606	"The delete operator sets the value of the specified property to undefined, but does not change the length of the array. This means that the deleted item will still be counted in the length of the array, but with a value of undefined.

On the other hand, the splice method can be used to add or remove elements from an array and also updates the length of the array. When you use splice to remove an item, it physically removes it from the array and updates the indices of other elements accordingly.

In other words, if you use delete to remove an item from an array, you will have an array with an undefined value at the index where the item was deleted. If you use splice, that item will be completely removed and the array length will be updated.

So, in summary, splice is the preferred method for removing elements from an array, because it gives you more control over the final state of the array."	eu.c4c8d23c-05bc-4b54-84ee-153bc098ec05				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e09b86d7780d1c204e9fa7	00023de272--63dfab946adb8b18a55bab99	00023de272--63e09b86d7780d1c204e9fa7	c32e67a609f17871837bd42a8aa41596	APPROVED	2023-02-06T06:17:42.755	+

Incorrect SQL syntax: check the SQL statement and make sure that it's properly formatted and includes quotes around the value of $username.

Failed query: the query may have failed to execute due to an issue with the query, the database connection, or the database server itself. Check the return value of mysql_query() to see if it's false.

Incorrect use of LIKE: in your code, you are using LIKE to compare the value of the username column to the value of the $username variable. However, LIKE is used for pattern matching, not for equality. To compare for equality, use = instead.

To fix this issue, try the following:

Modify the SQL statement to use quotes around the value of $username:
$result = mysql_query(""SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserName = '$username'"");

Check the return value of mysql_query():
$result = mysql_query(""SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserName = '$username'"");
if (!$result) {
echo ""Error: "" . mysql_error();
exit;

Make sure that the database connection is established and that the database server is running.
Note: the mysql extension is outdated and deprecated as of PHP 5.5, and has been removed in PHP 7. It is recommended to use either mysqli or PDO instead.

"Git push rejected after feature branch rebase
OK, I thought this was a simple git scenario, what am I missing?

A--B--C------F--G  (master)
       \    
        D--E  (feature)

"Swift Beta performance: sorting arrays
I was implementing an algorithm in Swift Beta and noticed that the performance was very poor. After digging deeper I realized that one of the bottlenecks was something as simple as sorting arrays. The relevant part is here:
let n = 1000000
var x =  [Int](repeating: 0, count: n)
for i in 0..<n {
    x[i] = random()
}
// start clock here
let y = sort(x)
// stop clock here
In C++, a similar operation takes 0.06s on my computer.
In Python, it takes 0.6s (no tricks, just y = sorted(x) for a list of integers).
In Swift it takes 6s if I compile it with the following command:
xcrun swift -O3 -sdk `xcrun --show-sdk-path --sdk macosx`
And it takes as much as 88s if I compile it with the following command:
xcrun swift -O0 -sdk `xcrun --show-sdk-path --sdk macosx`
Timings in Xcode with ""Release"" vs. ""Debug"" builds are similar.
What is wrong here? I could understand some performance loss in comparison with C++, but not a 10-fold slowdown in comparison with pure Python.
Edit: weather noticed that changing -O3 to -Ofast makes this code run almost as fast as the C++ version! However, -Ofast changes the semantics of the language a lot — in my testing, it disabled the checks for integer overflows and array indexing overflows. For example, with -Ofast the following Swift code runs silently without crashing (and prints out some garbage):
let n = 10000000
print(n*n*n*n*n)
let x =  [Int](repeating: 10, count: n)
print(x[n])
So -Ofast is not what we want; the whole point of Swift is that we have the safety nets in place. Of course, the safety nets have some impact on the performance, but they should not make the programs 100 times slower. Remember that Java already checks for array bounds, and in typical cases, the slowdown is by a factor much less than 2. And in Clang and GCC we have got -ftrapv for checking (signed) integer overflows, and it is not that slow, either.
Hence the question: how can we get reasonable performance in Swift without losing the safety nets?
Edit 2: I did some more benchmarking, with very simple loops along the lines of
for i in 0..<n {
    x[i] = x[i] ^ 12345678
}
(Here the xor operation is there just so that I can more easily find the relevant loop in the assembly code. I tried to pick an operation that is easy to spot but also ""harmless"" in the sense that it should not require any checks related to integer overflows.)
Again, there was a huge difference in the performance between -O3 and -Ofast. So I had a look at the assembly code:
With -Ofast I get pretty much what I would expect. The relevant part is a loop with 5 machine language instructions.
With -O3 I get something that was beyond my wildest imagination. The inner loop spans 88 lines of assembly code. I did not try to understand all of it, but the most suspicious parts are 13 invocations of ""callq _swift_retain"" and another 13 invocations of ""callq _swift_release"". That is, 26 subroutine calls in the inner loop!
Edit 3: In comments, Ferruccio asked for benchmarks that are fair in the sense that they do not rely on built-in functions (e.g. sort). I think the following program is a fairly good example:
let n = 10000
var x = [Int](repeating: 1, count: n)
for i in 0..<n {
    for j in 0..<n {
        x[i] = x[j]
    }
}
There is no arithmetic, so we do not need to worry about integer overflows. The only thing that we do is just lots of array references. And the results are here—Swift -O3 loses by a factor almost 500 in comparison with -Ofast:
C++ -O3: 0.05 s
C++ -O0: 0.4 s
Java: 0.2 s
Python with PyPy: 0.5 s
Python: 12 s
Swift -Ofast: 0.05 s
Swift -O3: 23 s
Swift -O0: 443 s
(If you are concerned that the compiler might optimize out the pointless loops entirely, you can change it to e.g. x[i] ^= x[j], and add a print statement that outputs x[0]. This does not change anything; the timings will be very similar.)
And yes, here the Python implementation was a stupid pure Python implementation with a list of ints and nested for loops. It should be much slower than unoptimized Swift. Something seems to be seriously broken with Swift and array indexing.
Edit 4: These issues (as well as some other performance issues) seems to have been fixed in Xcode 6 beta 5.
For sorting, I now have the following timings:
clang++ -O3: 0.06 s
swiftc -Ofast: 0.1 s
swiftc -O: 0.1 s
swiftc: 4 s
For nested loops:
clang++ -O3: 0.06 s
swiftc -Ofast: 0.3 s
swiftc -O: 0.4 s
swiftc: 540 s
It seems that there is no reason anymore to use the unsafe -Ofast (a.k.a. -Ounchecked); plain -O produces equally good code.
"	24101718	"The slow performance of sorting arrays in Swift is likely due to the safety checks performed by the Swift runtime for array indexing and integer overflow. The -Ofast optimization level disables these checks, which leads to a significant improvement in performance, but also potentially allows for undefined behavior if such checks are necessary.
To get reasonable performance in Swift while maintaining the safety checks, consider using the -O optimization level instead of -O0 or -Ofast, and potentially improving the performance through algorithmic optimization or other techniques."	eu.c94ae81c-5277-4c04-9287-589f5e23591d				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e09ebde0fa77410122b5a6	00023de272--63dfaba76adb8b18a55bb194	00023de272--63e09ebde0fa77410122b5a6	c32e67a609f17871837bd42a8aa41596	APPROVED	2023-02-06T06:31:25.372	+

"What is the difference between ++i and i++?
In C, what is the difference between using ++i and i++, and which should be used in the incrementation block of a for loop?
"	24853	"++i and i++ are both increment operator in C language, they both increment the value of i by 1. However, the difference between them is the order in which they increment the value of i and return the value.

++i is called the pre-increment operator, it increments the value of i before it is used.
i++ is called the post-increment operator, it increments the value of i after it has been used.
In the context of a for loop, both ++i and i++ can be used as the incrementation expression. However, the difference between them can sometimes matter in terms of the loop behavior. When using ++i, the incremented value is used immediately in the loop condition, whereas when using i++, the original value is used in the loop condition and then incremented afterwards.

Here's an example to illustrate the difference between ++i and i++ in a for loop:

css

for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
    printf(""%d\n"", i);
}

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {

"Shell command to tar directory excluding certain files/folders
Is there a simple shell command/script that supports excluding certain files/folders from being archived?
I have a directory that need to be archived with a sub directory that has a number of very large files I do not need to backup.
Not quite solutions:
The tar --exclude=PATTERN command matches the given pattern and excludes those files, but I need specific files & folders to be ignored (full file path), otherwise valid files might be excluded.
I could also use the find command to create a list of files and exclude the ones I don't want to archive and pass the list to tar, but that only works with for a small amount of files. I have tens of thousands.
I'm beginning to think the only solution is to create a file with a list of files/folders to be excluded, then use rsync with --exclude-from=file to copy all the files to a tmp directory, and then use tar to archive that directory.
Can anybody think of a better/more efficient solution?
EDIT: Charles Ma's solution works well. The big gotcha is that the --exclude='./folder' MUST be at the beginning of the tar command. Full command (cd first, so backup is relative to that directory):
cd /folder_to_backup
tar --exclude='./folder' --exclude='./upload/folder2' -zcvf /backup/filename.tgz .

I'm a beginner in C programming, but I was wondering what's the difference between using typedef when defining a structure versus not using typedef. It seems to me like there's really no difference, they accomplish the same goal.
struct myStruct{
    int one;
    int two;
};
vs.
typedef struct{
    int one;
    int two;
}myStruct;
"	1675351	"Yes, there is a difference.

In the first example, you are defining a struct type named ""myStruct"" and creating variables of that type using the keyword ""struct.""

In the second example, you are using ""typedef"" to give a synonym to the struct type, so you can create variables of that type using the new type name ""myStruct"". This can be useful in cases where you want to create a lot of instances of the struct, and the shorter type name can make the code more readable and concise.

Both of these definitions are equivalent and provide the same functionality."	eu.5edb0d36-a673-4973-90df-5a767fcb5f4b				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e0ba83e0fa77410125c1ef	00023de272--63dfaba66adb8b18a55bb121	00023de272--63e0ba83e0fa77410125c1ef	eecfce578ec8f52e1db33743c0b80f7f	APPROVED	2023-02-06T08:29:55.435	+

"How can I find the time complexity of an algorithm?
I have gone through Google and Stack Overflow search, but nowhere I was able to find a clear and straightforward explanation for how to calculate time complexity.
What do I know already?
Say for code as simple as the one below:
char h = 'y'; // This will be executed 1 time
int abc = 0; // This will be executed 1 time
Say for a loop like the one below:
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    Console.Write('Hello, World!!');
}
int i=0; This will be executed only once.
The time is actually calculated to i=0 and not the declaration.
i < N; This will be executed N+1 times
i++ This will be executed N times
So the number of operations required by this loop are {1+(N+1)+N} = 2N+2. (But this still may be wrong, as I am not confident about my understanding.)
OK, so these small basic calculations I think I know, but in most cases I have seen the time complexity as O(N), O(n^2), O(log n), O(n!), and many others.
"	11032015	"The time complexity of an algorithm is a way to describe how the running time of the algorithm grows with the size of the input. It gives an idea of how much more time an algorithm will take when the size of the input increases.

In most cases, you'll use Big O notation to describe the time complexity of an algorithm. Big O notation gives an upper bound on the growth rate of the running time of an algorithm. For example, an algorithm with a time complexity of O(N) means that its running time will increase linearly with the size of the input. An algorithm with a time complexity of O(N^2) means that its running time will increase quadratically with the size of the input.

To calculate the time complexity of an algorithm, you need to consider the operations performed by the algorithm and how they are impacted by the size of the input. Here are the steps to calculate the time complexity:

    Identify the operations performed by the algorithm.
    Determine how the number of operations performed depends on the size of the input.
    Express the number of operations as a function of the size of the input, using big O notation.

Let's consider the example you mentioned:

css

for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    Console.Write('Hello, World!!');
}

Here, the operation performed is Console.Write('Hello, World!!'), which will be executed N times. So, the time complexity of this loop is O(N), meaning that the running time will increase linearly with the size of N.

In general, you can use this approach to calculate the time complexity of an algorithm by considering the most significant operations and how they are impacted by the size of the input."	eu.d7ab9584-3eb4-4c35-a7e0-87bdc7a5c084				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e0be2ead7a1656d93d63ab	00023de272--63dfaba26adb8b18a55bb002	00023de272--63e0be2ead7a1656d93d63ab	eecfce578ec8f52e1db33743c0b80f7f	APPROVED	2023-02-06T08:45:34.898	+	
"What does set -e mean in a bash script?
I'm studying the content of this preinst file that the script executes before that package is unpacked from its Debian archive (.deb) file.
The script has the following code:
#!/bin/bash
set -e
# Automatically added by dh_installinit
if [ ""$1"" = install ]; then
   if [ -d /usr/share/MyApplicationName ]; then
     echo ""MyApplicationName is just installed""

   rm -Rf $HOME/.local/share/file-manager/actions/*
fi
# End automatically added section
My first query is about the line:
set -e
I think that the rest of the script is pretty simple: It checks whether the Debian/Ubuntu package manager is executing an install operation. If it is, it checks whether my application has just been installed on the system. If it has, the script prints the message ""MyApplicationName is just installed"" and ends (return 1 mean that ends with an “error”, doesn’t it?).
If the user is asking the Debian/Ubuntu package system to install my package, the script also deletes two directories.
Is this right or am I missing something?
"	19622198	"Your understanding of the script is mostly correct.

The line set -e is used to specify that the script should exit immediately if a command returns a non-zero exit status. In other words, if any command in the script fails, the script will stop executing and return an error status.

The purpose of this line is to ensure that the script stops executing as soon as an error occurs, rather than continuing to execute subsequent commands even though an error has already happened. This can be useful in scripts that perform critical tasks, such as package installation scripts, where it's important to halt execution and report an error as soon as possible if something goes wrong.

"Can I recover a branch after its deletion in Git?
If I run git branch -d XYZ, is there a way to recover the branch? Is there a way to go back as if I didn't run the delete branch command?
"	3640764	"Yes, it is possible to recover a deleted branch in Git using the reflog. The reflog is a record of changes to the branches and head pointers in your Git repository. To recover a deleted branch, you can use the command:

sql
Copy code
$ git branch new-branch-name [commit-hash]

"	3293531	"To permanently remove a few commits from a remote branch, you need to perform the following steps:

Clone the repository locally: Run git clone <repository-url> to clone the repository to your local machine.

Checkout the branch you want to modify: Run git checkout <branch-name> to switch to the branch that you want to modify.

Revert the unwanted commits: Run git revert <commit-hash> for each commit you want to remove. The commit-hash is the unique identifier of the commit that you want to remove.

Force push to the remote branch: Run git push origin <branch-name> --force to overwrite the remote branch with your locally modified version.

"BehaviorSubject vs Observable?
I'm looking into Angular RxJs patterns and I don't understand the difference between a BehaviorSubject and an Observable.
From my understanding, a BehaviorSubject is a value that can change over time (can be subscribed to and subscribers can receive updated results). This seems to be the exact same purpose of an Observable.  
When would you use an Observable vs a BehaviorSubject? Are there benefits to using a BehaviorSubject over an Observable or vice versa?
"	39494058	"An Observable is a stream of values that can emit multiple values over time. It can be subscribed to and it can emit values to its subscribers asynchronously.

A BehaviorSubject, on the other hand, is a specific type of Subject in RxJS. It behaves like an Observable but also has the ability to hold and return the current value. Whenever a new observer subscribes to it, it immediately receives the latest value emitted by the BehaviorSubject as its first value.

"Try-catch speeding up my code?

        fibo = n1 + n2;
    }
    return fibo;

On my computer, this consistently prints out a value around 0.96..
When I wrap the for loop inside Fibo() with a try-catch block like this:
static long Fibo(int n)
{
    long n1 = 0, n2 = 1, fibo = 0;
    n++;
    try

}
Now it consistently prints out 0.69... -- it actually runs faster! But why?
Note: I compiled this using the Release configuration and directly ran the EXE file (outside Visual Studio).
EDIT: Jon Skeet's excellent analysis shows that try-catch is somehow causing the x86 CLR to use the CPU registers in a more favorable way in this specific case (and I think we're yet to understand why). I confirmed Jon's finding that x64 CLR doesn't have this difference, and that it was faster than the x86 CLR. I also tested using int types inside the Fibo method instead of long types, and then the x86 CLR was as equally fast as the x64 CLR.

"	8928403	The difference in performance between the two cases is due to the way the x86 CLR optimizes the code when a try-catch block is present. The x86 CLR uses CPU registers differently in the presence of a try-catch block, leading to improved performance in this specific case. However, the optimization doesn't occur in the x64 CLR.

"Angular/RxJS When should I unsubscribe from `Subscription`
When should I store the Subscription instances and invoke unsubscribe() during the ngOnDestroy life cycle and when can I simply ignore them?
Saving all subscriptions introduces a lot of mess into component code.
HTTP Client Guide ignore subscriptions like this:
getHeroes() {
  this.heroService.getHeroes()
                  .subscribe(
                     heroes => this.heroes = heroes,
                     error =>  this.errorMessage = <any>error);
}
In the same time Route & Navigation Guide says that:
Eventually, we'll navigate somewhere else. The router will remove this component from the DOM and destroy it. We need to clean up after ourselves before that happens. Specifically, we must unsubscribe before Angular destroys the component. Failure to do so could create a memory leak.
We unsubscribe from our Observable in the ngOnDestroy method.
private sub: any;
ngOnInit() {
  this.sub = this.route.params.subscribe(params => {
     let id = +params['id']; // (+) converts string 'id' to a number
     this.service.getHero(id).then(hero => this.hero = hero);
   });
}
ngOnDestroy() {
  this.sub.unsubscribe();
}
"	38008334	You should unsubscribe from a Subscription in the ngOnDestroy lifecycle method if the subscription is likely to produce values after the component is destroyed. If a subscription is short-lived and completes before the component is destroyed, then there is no need to unsubscribe and you can simply ignore it. An example of a short-lived subscription is a one-time HTTP request, which is likely to complete before the component is destroyed. An example of a subscription that needs to be unsubscribed is a route parameter subscription, which may produce values after the component is destroyed if the user navigates to another route. It's always a good practice to unsubscribe from subscriptions in the ngOnDestroy method to prevent potential memory leaks.	eu.72a5b310-9a82-46af-a5a5-0bc1d3171031				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e0ebca6ee87c7e28cf28c7	00023de272--63dfaba76adb8b18a55bb16d	00023de272--63e0ebca6ee87c7e28cf28c7	420edf6930f74d245330296489f788e8	APPROVED	2023-02-06T12:00:10.068	+	
"In CSS Flexbox, why are there no ""justify-items"" and ""justify-self"" properties?
Consider the main axis and cross axis of a flex container:
Source: W3C
To align flex items along the main axis there is one property:
justify-content
To align flex items along the cross axis there are three properties:
align-content
align-items
align-self
In the image above, the main axis is horizontal and the cross axis is vertical. These are the default directions of a flex container.
However, these directions can be easily interchanged with the flex-direction property.
/* main axis is horizontal, cross axis is vertical */
flex-direction: row;
flex-direction: row-reverse;
/* main axis is vertical, cross axis is horizontal */    
flex-direction: column;
flex-direction: column-reverse;
(The cross axis is always perpendicular to the main axis.)
My point in describing how the axes' work is that there doesn't seem to be anything special about either direction. Main axis, cross axis, they're both equal in terms of importance and flex-direction makes it easy to switch back and forth.
So why does the cross axis get two additional alignment properties?
Why are align-content and align-items consolidated into one property for the main axis?
Why does the main axis not get a justify-self property?
Scenarios where these properties would be useful:
placing a flex item in the corner of the flex container
#box3 { align-self: flex-end; justify-self: flex-end; }
making a group of flex items align-right (justify-content: flex-end) but have the first item align left (justify-self: flex-start)
Consider a header section with a group of nav items and a logo. With justify-self the logo could be aligned left while the nav items stay far right, and the whole thing adjusts smoothly (""flexes"") to different screen sizes.
in a row of three flex items, affix the middle item to the center of the container  (justify-content: center) and align the adjacent items to the container edges (justify-self: flex-start and justify-self: flex-end).
Note that values space-around and space-between on
justify-content property  will not keep the middle item centered about the container if the adjacent items have different widths.
#container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  background-color: lightyellow;
}
.box {
  height: 50px;
  width: 75px;
  background-color: springgreen;
}
.box1 {
  width: 100px;
}
.box3 {
  width: 200px;
}
#center {
  text-align: center;
  margin-bottom: 5px;
}
#center > span {
  background-color: aqua;
  padding: 2px;
}
<div id=""center"">
  <span>TRUE CENTER</span>
</div>
<div id=""container"">
  <div class=""box box1""></div>
  <div class=""box box2""></div>
  <div class=""box box3""></div>
</div>
<p>note that the middlebox will only be truly centered if adjacent boxes are equal width</p>
jsFiddle version
As of this writing, there is no mention of justify-self or justify-items in the flexbox spec.
However, in the CSS Box Alignment Module, which is the W3C's unfinished proposal to establish a common set of alignment properties for use across all box models, there is this:
                                                                                                                                                   Source: W3C
You'll notice that justify-self and justify-items are being considered... but not for flexbox.
I'll end by reiterating the main question:
Why are there no ""justify-items"" and ""justify-self"" properties?
"	32551291	"The reason there are no ""justify-items"" and ""justify-self"" properties in CSS Flexbox is because they have not been included in the specification. The CSS Box Alignment Module, which aims to establish a common set of alignment properties across all box models, is still a work in progress and does not currently include these properties for use in flexbox. The current set of properties and values for aligning flex items along the main axis and cross axis have been determined to be sufficient for the majority of use cases."	eu.8789f2a4-ebd8-49cc-897a-85202870098b				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e0ebfe1bef1830b39a2018	00023de272--63dfaba26adb8b18a55bb03b	00023de272--63e0ebfe1bef1830b39a2018	420edf6930f74d245330296489f788e8	APPROVED	2023-02-06T12:01:02.058	+

I managed to see the file using gitk, but it doesn't have an option to save it. I tried with command-line tools, the closest I got was:
git-show 27cf8e84bb88e24ae4b4b3df2b77aab91a3735d8 my_file.txt
However, this command shows a diff, and not the file contents. I know I can later use something like PAGER=cat and redirect output to a file, but I don't know how to get to the actual file content.
Basically, I'm looking for something like svn cat.
"	610208	"You can use the git checkout command to retrieve a single file from a specific revision. Here's how you can do it:

lua

git checkout 27cf8e84bb88e24ae4b4b3df2b77aab91a3735d8 -- my_file.txt

This will check out the specified revision of the file my_file.txt. If you want to save it as a new file, you can use the cp command:

bash

cp my_file.txt my_file_27cf8e8.txt

Note that checking out a specific revision will temporarily switch your Git repository to that state, so be sure to switch back to the latest revision using git checkout master or the appropriate branch name before making any changes to your code.

"Local Storage vs Cookies
I want to reduce load times on my websites by moving all cookies into local storage since they seem to have the same functionality. Are there any pros/cons (especially performance-wise) in using local storage to replace cookie functionality except for the obvious compatibility issues?
"	3220660	"Cookies and local storage are both web storage options that can be used to store data on the client side. However, there are some differences between them:

Pros of local storage:

    Large storage capacity: Local storage has a larger storage capacity compared to cookies (typically 5-10 MB).
    Persistence: Local storage data persists even after the browser is closed.
    Faster access: Accessing data in local storage is faster compared to cookies as the data is stored in a structured manner and doesn't need to be sent with every HTTP request.

Cons of local storage:

    Insecurity: Local storage data is not automatically encrypted and can be easily accessed by attackers if the user's device is compromised.
    No expiration date: Unlike cookies, local storage data does not have an expiration date and will persist until explicitly deleted by the user or the website.

Pros of cookies:

    Expiration date: Cookies have an expiration date, which allows you to control the lifetime of the stored data.
    Secure storage: Cookies can be encrypted and transmitted over secure HTTPS connections, making them more secure compared to local storage.

Cons of cookies:

    Limited size: Cookies have a limited size (typically 4 KB), which makes them unsuitable for storing large amounts of data.
    Slower access: Cookies are sent with every HTTP request, which increases the amount of data transmitted and slows down the website's performance.

In conclusion, local storage is generally a better choice if you need to store large amounts of data, but it lacks the security and expiration date features of cookies. Cookies are more secure, but have limited storage capacity and can slow down website performance. If you need to move all cookies into local storage, it's recommended to make sure that sensitive information is properly encrypted and secured before being stored in local storage."	eu.139229c8-cbce-47f4-93a0-f94488ba6e69				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e0ee2dfaab2d703d6ead61	00023de272--63dfab956adb8b18a55babf4	00023de272--63e0ee2dfaab2d703d6ead61	eecfce578ec8f52e1db33743c0b80f7f	APPROVED	2023-02-06T12:10:21.317	+

"Why is Dictionary preferred over Hashtable in C#?
In most programming languages, dictionaries are preferred over hashtables.
What are the reasons behind that?
"	301371	"In C#, the Dictionary class is preferred over the Hashtable class for several reasons:

    Strongly Typed: The Dictionary class is strongly typed, meaning that it allows you to store only values of a specific type. Hashtable, on the other hand, is not strongly typed, so you can store any type of object in it.

    Performance: Dictionaries are faster than hashtables because they are implemented as a generic data structure and use a hash table internally for searching. Hashtables, on the other hand, use a linked list to handle collisions.

    Linq support: Dictionary provides support for LINQ (Language Integrated Query), which makes it easier to filter and manipulate data.

    Null keys: Dictionary class allows you to use null as a key, while Hashtable does not.

    Simplified Syntax: The syntax of the Dictionary class is much simpler and more readable compared to the Hashtable class.

    Garbage Collection: Dictionaries are reference types, which means that they are managed by the garbage collector. Hashtables, on the other hand, are not managed by the garbage collector and need to be explicitly released when no longer in use.

    Non-thread safe: The Dictionary class is not thread-safe by default, while the Hashtable class is. However, this can be an advantage in certain scenarios where you want to avoid the overhead of thread safety.

"'Must Override a Superclass Method' Errors after importing a project into Eclipse
Anytime I have to re-import my projects into Eclipse (if I reinstalled Eclipse, or changed the location of the projects), almost all of my overridden methods are not formatted correctly, causing the error:
  The method must override a superclass method
It may be noteworthy to mention this is with Android projects for whatever reason, the method argument values are not always populated, so I have to manually populate them myself. For instance:
list.setOnCreateContextMenuListener(new OnCreateContextMenuListener() {
    //These arguments have their correct names
    public void onCreateContextMenu(ContextMenu menu, View v, 
                                    ContextMenuInfo menuInfo) {                 
    }

will be initially populated like this:
list.setOnCreateContextMenuListener(new OnCreateContextMenuListener() {
    //This methods arguments were not automatically provided    
    public void onCreateContextMenu(ContextMenu arg1, View arg2,
                                    ContextMenuInfo arg3) {
    }
});
The odd thing is, if I remove my code, and have Eclipse automatically recreate the method, it uses the same argument names I already had, so I don't really know where the problem is, other then it auto-formatting the method for me.
This becomes quite a pain having to manually recreate ALL my overridden methods by hand. If anyone can explain why this happens or how to fix it. I would be very happy.
Maybe it is due to the way I am formatting the methods, which are inside an argument of another method?
"	1678122	"It seems to be an issue with Eclipse's code formatting and auto-populating feature. There could be different reasons causing this issue like:

So, what is the difference between Class Library (.NET Standard) and Class Library (.NET Core), why do both exist, and when should we use one over the other?
"	42939454	".NET Core is a cross-platform, open-source implementation of the .NET platform that was created by Microsoft. It includes a runtime, library framework, and tools.

.NET Standard is a set of APIs that are common across the different .NET platforms, including .NET Core, .NET Framework, Xamarin, and others. The purpose of .NET Standard is to provide a common API surface that allows developers to create libraries that can be reused across multiple .NET platforms.

When creating a Class Library project in Visual Studio, if you choose .NET Standard, your library will target a specific version of .NET Standard and will work on any .NET platform that supports that version of .NET Standard. This makes it easy to create reusable libraries that can be used on multiple platforms.

If you choose .NET Core, your library will target .NET Core specifically, and will only work on .NET Core platforms. This option is useful when you need to take advantage of .NET Core specific features or want to create a library that is specifically intended for .NET Core.

In summary, you should use Class Library (.NET Standard) if you want to create a reusable library that will work on multiple .NET platforms, and Class Library (.NET Core) if you want to create a library that is specifically targeted to .NET Core."	eu.1e4d6dcb-78e0-4bb3-98ec-6e16269d0f37				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e0f288f24cb959b9267bc6	00023de272--63dfaba66adb8b18a55bb102	00023de272--63e0f288f24cb959b9267bc6	eecfce578ec8f52e1db33743c0b80f7f	APPROVED	2023-02-06T12:28:56.718	+

"Strange OutOfMemory issue while loading an image to a Bitmap object
I have a ListView with a couple of image buttons on each row. When the user clicks the list row, it launches a new activity. I have had to build my own tabs because of an issue with the camera layout. The activity that gets launched for the result is a map. If I click on my button to launch the image preview (load an image off the SD card) the application returns from the activity back to the ListView activity to the result handler to relaunch my new activity which is nothing more than an image widget.
The image preview on the ListView is being done with the cursor and ListAdapter. This makes it pretty simple, but I am not sure how I can put a resized image (I.e. Smaller bit size not pixel as the src for the image button on the fly. So I just resized the image that came off the phone camera.
The issue is that I get an OutOfMemoryError when it tries to go back and re-launch the 2nd activity.
Is there a way I can build the list adapter easily row by row, where I can resize on the fly (bitwise)?
This would be preferable as I also need to make some changes to the properties of the widgets/elements in each row as I am unable to select a row with the touch screen because of the focus issue. (I can use rollerball.)
I know I can do an out of band resize and save my image, but that is not really what I want to do, but some sample code for that would be nice.
As soon as I disabled the image on the ListView it worked fine again.
FYI: This is how I was doing it:
String[] from = new String[] { DBHelper.KEY_BUSINESSNAME, DBHelper.KEY_ADDRESS,
    DBHelper.KEY_CITY, DBHelper.KEY_GPSLONG, DBHelper.KEY_GPSLAT,
    DBHelper.KEY_IMAGEFILENAME  + """"};
int[] to = new int[] { R.id.businessname, R.id.address, R.id.city, R.id.gpslong,
    R.id.gpslat, R.id.imagefilename };
notes = new SimpleCursorAdapter(this, R.layout.notes_row, c, from, to);
setListAdapter(notes);
Where R.id.imagefilename is a ButtonImage.

To resolve this issue, you need to reduce the size of the Bitmap before trying to load it. You can do this by using the BitmapFactory.Options class, setting the inSampleSize field to a value greater than 1, and then decoding the Bitmap with the new options.

Here is an example of how you could do this:

java

BitmapFactory.Options options = new BitmapFactory.Options();
options.inSampleSize = 2; // reduce the size of the image by a factor of 2
Bitmap bitmap = BitmapFactory.decodeFile(filePath, options);

In this example, filePath is the path to the image file on the SD card. The inSampleSize field is set to 2, which means that the size of the image will be reduced by a factor of 2. You can adjust this value to a larger number if needed to reduce the size of the image even further."	eu.4143eb2b-5a18-49ad-9984-25355e0469c6				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e0f32dd9b645131c2201c5	00023de272--63dfab956adb8b18a55babfd	00023de272--63e0f32dd9b645131c2201c5	eecfce578ec8f52e1db33743c0b80f7f	APPROVED	2023-02-06T12:31:41.035	+

"angular.service vs angular.factory
I have seen both angular.factory() and angular.service() used to declare services; however, I cannot find angular.service anywhere in official documentation.
What is the difference between the two methods?
Which should be used for what (assuming they do different things)?
"	14324451	"""angular.service()"" and ""angular.factory()"" are both AngularJS functions used to create services in AngularJS.

The main difference between the two is in how they create the service object:

    ""angular.service()"" creates a service object using the ""constructor"" method, while
    ""angular.factory()"" creates a service object using a factory function.

It's recommended to use ""angular.factory()"" instead of ""angular.service()"" as it's more flexible and provides more options for how to create the service object. However, in AngularJS 1.3, the ""angular.service()"" method was removed and ""angular.factory()"" became the recommended way to create services.

In Angular (2+), services are created using the ""@Injectable"" decorator, and there is no equivalent of ""angular.service()"" or ""angular.factory()"".

"	661561	"It depends on the programming language and framework you are using. In general, GUI updates must be done on the main thread to avoid threading issues.

For example, in Windows Forms (C#), you can use the Invoke method to update the UI from another thread:

vbnet

private void UpdateLabel(string text)
{
    if (InvokeRequired)
    {
        this.Invoke(new Action<string>(UpdateLabel), new object[] { text });
        return;
    }
    label1.Text = text;
}

In WPF (C#), you can use the Dispatcher class to update the UI from another thread:

csharp

private void UpdateLabel(string text)
{
    Dispatcher.Invoke(() => { label1.Content = text; });
}

In Qt (C++), you can use the QMetaObject::invokeMethod to update the UI from another thread:

css

QMetaObject::invokeMethod(label, ""setText"", Qt::QueuedConnection, Q_ARG(QString, text));

These are just examples, you should check the specific documentation for your programming language and framework for the best way to update the GUI from another thread.

"What does the 'b' character do in front of a string literal?
Apparently, the following is the valid syntax:
b'The string'
I would like to know:
What does this b character in front of the string mean?
What are the effects of using it?
What are appropriate situations to use it?
I found a related question right here on SO, but that question is about PHP though, and it states the b is used to indicate the string is binary, as opposed to Unicode, which was needed for code to be compatible from version of PHP < 6, when migrating to PHP 6. I don't think this applies to Python.
I did find this documentation on the Python site about using a u character in the same syntax to specify a string as Unicode. Unfortunately, it doesn't mention the b character anywhere in that document.
Also, just out of curiosity, are there more symbols than the b and u that do other things?
"	6269765	"The b character in front of a string literal in Python indicates a ""bytes literal"".

It is used to specify a sequence of bytes and is usually used for binary data, such as encoding and decoding. Bytes literals are useful for working with binary data such as image or audio files. They are also useful for working with protocols that use ASCII or other 8-bit encoded characters.

For example:

python

>>> b'Hello World'
b'Hello World'

In Python 3, the b character is not necessary to use when creating byte strings, because in Python 3, the default string type is Unicode, whereas in Python 2, it's ASCII.

In addition to b and u symbols, there is also an f symbol in front of string literals to create ""f-strings"" in Python 3.3 and later. F-strings are a new feature in Python and allow for string interpolation in a more readable and efficient way.

For example:

python

>>> name = ""Alice""
>>> f""Hello, {name}""
'Hello, Alice'"	eu.888cfd58-3f3f-4a5f-b7b5-3363436446e6				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e0f55ba483b403894e1eb1	00023de272--63dfab986adb8b18a55bad09	00023de272--63e0f55ba483b403894e1eb1	eecfce578ec8f52e1db33743c0b80f7f	APPROVED	2023-02-06T12:40:59.681	+

"Where can I find documentation on formatting a date in JavaScript?
I noticed that JavaScript's new Date() function is very smart in accepting dates in several formats.
Xmas95 = new Date(""25 Dec, 1995 23:15:00"")
Xmas95 = new Date(""2009 06 12,12:52:39"")
Xmas95 = new Date(""20 09 2006,12:52:39"")
I could not find documentation anywhere showing all the valid string formats while calling new Date() function.
This is for converting a string to a date. If we look at the opposite side, that is, converting a date object to a string, until now I was under the impression that JavaScript doesn't have a built-in API to format a date object into a string.
  Editor's note: The following approach is the asker's attempt that worked on a particular browser but does not work in general; see the answers on this page to see some actual solutions.
Today, I played with the toString() method on the date object and surprisingly it serves the purpose of formatting date to strings.
var d1 = new Date();
d1.toString('yyyy-MM-dd');       //Returns ""2009-06-29"" in Internet Explorer, but not Firefox or Chrome
d1.toString('dddd, MMMM ,yyyy')  //Returns ""Monday, June 29,2009"" in Internet Explorer, but not Firefox or Chrome
Also here I couldn't find any documentation on all the ways we can format the date object into a string.
Where is the documentation which lists the format specifiers supported by the Date() object?
"	1056728	"The toString() method is not a reliable way to format a date object as a string, as it returns an implementation-specific string representation of the date, which might not adhere to any particular format.

To format a date object as a string in JavaScript, you can use a library such as moment.js or write your own custom formatting function. The built-in toLocaleString() method can also be used to format a date, but it provides a limited set of options and may not be suitable for all use cases.

In this method, a static block is used to initialize the static final map. This method is used when the size of the map is known at the time of declaration and can be used directly in other static methods. The map is initialized before any objects of the class are created.

Method two: Instance Initializer (Anonymous Subclass)
In this method, an anonymous subclass of the map is created and initialized in the same line as the map declaration. This method is used when the size of the map is not known at the time of declaration and can be used to initialize the map in a more dynamic manner. The map is initialized before any objects of the class are created.

Pros of Method One:

Simple and straightforward
Easy to understand
Can be used in other static methods
Cons of Method One:

The size of the map must be known at the time of declaration
Pros of Method Two:

More flexible as the size of the map does not need to be known at the time of declaration
Cons of Method Two:

Slightly more complex than the first method
May be more difficult to understand for those who are not familiar with anonymous inner classes

Snapshots are typically built and published to a repository (such as Nexus or Artifactory) at regular intervals, so that other developers can get the latest version of the project.

The purpose of using snapshots is to provide a way for developers to collaborate on a project and integrate changes from each other in a timely manner. By sharing snapshots, developers can see the changes that others have made, and they can ensure that their own changes integrate properly with the latest version of the project."	eu.6e4101cd-0050-49f7-a341-8e38f85ef457				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e127d5f24cb959b92c9fb6	00023de272--63dfaba16adb8b18a55bafad	00023de272--63e127d5f24cb959b92c9fb6	d8e61a54e640dc786924fbd68be12067	APPROVED	2023-02-06T16:16:21.122	+

"What is the difference between '@' and '=' in directive scope in AngularJS?

Why do I have to use ""{{title}}"" with '@' and ""title"" with '='?
Can I also access the parent scope directly, without decorating my element with an attribute?
The documentation says ""Often it's desirable to pass data from the isolated scope via expression and to the parent scope"", but that seems to work fine with bidirectional binding too. Why would the expression route be better?
I found another fiddle that shows the expression solution too: http://jsfiddle.net/maxisam/QrCXh/
"	14050195	"In AngularJS, the @ symbol in a directive's scope definition is used to bind a string value from the attribute of the same name on the element to the directive's isolated scope. The value is passed as a string to the isolated scope property.

The = symbol in a directive's scope definition is used for two-way data binding between the directive's isolated scope property and a property on the parent scope. The value is passed as an expression to the isolated scope property and can be updated in either the parent or the isolated scope and the changes will be reflected in both scopes.

Regarding the use of {{title}} with @ and title with =, {{title}} is used to interpolate the value of title from the parent scope in the attribute of the directive's element, while title without curly braces is used to pass the value of the title property on the parent scope to the directive's isolated scope property via the = binding.

Regarding accessing the parent scope directly, it is possible to access the parent scope directly from the directive's isolated scope using the $parent property. However, it is generally discouraged as it creates a tight coupling between the directive and the parent scope, making the directive less reusable.

The expression route is better when it is desirable to pass data from the isolated scope to the parent scope.

Better readability and easier to maintain: ES6 syntax is more concise and easier to understand compared to module.exports and exports.
Interoperability with other JavaScript platforms: ES6 modules have a standardized syntax, making it easier to reuse code between different environments, such as web browsers and Node.js.
Tree-shaking: This is a feature of modern bundlers, such as Webpack, which eliminates unused exports from the final bundled file, reducing the size of the application.
Note that Node.js has partial support for ES6 modules, and some features, such as cyclic dependencies, are not fully supported yet. To use ES6 modules in a Node.js project, you will need to run your code through a transpiler, such as Babel, to convert the syntax to CommonJS, which is the module system supported by Node.js."	eu.97924a15-7b74-46a3-b603-3db3447e8866				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e13c2da5794a449fb1b72c	00023de272--63dfab986adb8b18a55bad10	00023de272--63e13c2da5794a449fb1b72c	d8e61a54e640dc786924fbd68be12067	APPROVED	2023-02-06T17:43:09.667	+

CROSS APPLY can be more efficient than INNER JOIN when the right-side query returns a small number of rows for each row on the left side. This is because CROSS APPLY is able to make use of the spool operator to cache intermediate results, avoiding the need to re-execute the right-side query for each row. On the other hand, INNER JOIN has to execute the right-side query for each row on the left side, which can be less efficient when the right-side query returns a large number of rows.

However, in many cases, the execution plans for INNER JOIN and CROSS APPLY will be the same.

"GitHub relative link in Markdown file
Is there a way to create a URL anchor, <a>, link from within a Markdown file, to another file within the same repository and branch (aka a link relative to the current branch)?

## myLib documentation
see documentation [here](myLib/README.md)

Here is a working example of what I mean:
GOTO http://github.com/rynop/testRel, link does not work.
GOTO http://github.com/rynop/testRel/blob/master/README.md, link works.
This is expected because at this point the starting URL is in the branch. Now how do I get it to pick up the current branch in the README.md at the root of the repository?

"Why not inherit from List<T>?
When planning out my programs, I often start with a chain of thought like so:
  A football team is just a list of football players. Therefore, I should represent it with:
var football_team = new List<FootballPlayer>();
  The ordering of this list represent the order in which the players are listed in the roster.
But I realize later that teams also have other properties, besides the mere list of players, that must be recorded. For example, the running total of scores this season, the current budget, the uniform colors, a string representing the name of the team, etc..
So then I think:
  Okay, a football team is just like a list of players, but additionally, it has a name (a string) and a running total of scores (an int). .NET does not provide a class for storing football teams, so I will make my own class. The most similar and relevant existing structure is List<FootballPlayer>, so I will inherit from it:
class FootballTeam : List<FootballPlayer> 
{ 
    public string TeamName; 
    public int RunningTotal 
}
But it turns out that a guideline says you shouldn't inherit from List<T>. I'm thoroughly confused by this guideline in two respects.
Why not?
Apparently List is somehow optimized for performance. How so? What performance problems will I cause if I extend List? What exactly will break?
Another reason I've seen is that List is provided by Microsoft, and I have no control over it, so I cannot change it later, after exposing a ""public API"". But I struggle to understand this. What is a public API and why should I care? If my current project does not and is not likely to ever have this public API, can I safely ignore this guideline? If I do inherit from List and it turns out I need a public API, what difficulties will I have?
Why does it even matter? A list is a list. What could possibly change? What could I possibly want to change?
And lastly, if Microsoft did not want me to inherit from List, why didn't they make the class sealed?
What else am I supposed to use?
Apparently, for custom collections, Microsoft has provided a Collection class which should be extended instead of List. But this class is very bare, and does not have many useful things, such as AddRange, for instance. jvitor83's answer provides a performance rationale for that particular method, but how is a slow AddRange not better than no AddRange?
Inheriting from Collection is way more work than inheriting from List, and I see no benefit. Surely Microsoft wouldn't tell me to do extra work for no reason, so I can't help feeling like I am somehow misunderstanding something, and inheriting Collection is actually not the right solution for my problem.
I've seen suggestions such as implementing IList. Just no. This is dozens of lines of boilerplate code which gains me nothing.
Lastly, some suggest wrapping the List in something: 
class FootballTeam 
{ 
    public List<FootballPlayer> Players; 
}
There are two problems with this:
It makes my code needlessly verbose. I must now call my_team.Players.Count instead of just my_team.Count. Thankfully, with C# I can define indexers to make indexing transparent, and forward all the methods of the internal List... But that's a lot of code! What do I get for all that work?
It just plain doesn't make any sense. A football team doesn't ""have"" a list of players. It is the list of players. You don't say ""John McFootballer has joined SomeTeam's players"". You say ""John has joined SomeTeam"". You don't add a letter to ""a string's characters"", you add a letter to a string. You don't add a book to a library's books, you add a book to a library.
I realize that what happens ""under the hood"" can be said to be ""adding X to Y's internal list"", but this seems like a very counter-intuitive way of thinking about the world.
My question (summarized)
What is the correct C# way of representing a data structure, which, ""logically"" (that is to say, ""to the human mind"") is just a list of things with a few bells and whistles?
Is inheriting from List<T> always unacceptable? When is it acceptable? Why/why not? What must a programmer consider, when deciding whether to inherit from List<T> or not?
"	21692193	"Inheriting from List<T> is generally discouraged for a few reasons:

    List is a concrete implementation of a collection, and inheriting from it might make it difficult to change the underlying implementation later. This is especially true if you are exposing the class as a public API, as you won't be able to change the implementation without breaking existing code.

    List has specific optimizations for performance, and if you inherit from it and add custom functionality, you might unintentionally break these optimizations, leading to sub-optimal performance.

    The principle of inheritance is best used to extend the behavior of a base class, not just to reuse its implementation. In other words, inheritance should express an ""is-a"" relationship, rather than just a ""has-a"" relationship.

Instead of inheriting from List<T>, a better solution is to use composition, where you have a private List<T> field and expose the required functionality through custom methods and properties. This allows you to encapsulate the List<T> implementation and change it if needed.

If you need a custom collection, Microsoft recommends using the Collection<T> class as the base class, which provides a more appropriate base for custom collections than List<T>. If you find that the Collection<T> class is too bare-bones for your needs, you can add custom functionality on top of it. This gives you the benefit of having a well-designed, flexible base class, without the risks associated with inheriting from List<T>.

- (void)moveBannerOffScreen {
    [UIView animateWithDuration:5 animations:^{
        _addBannerDistanceFromBottomConstraint.constant = -32;
    }];
    bannerIsVisible = FALSE;
}
- (void)moveBannerOnScreen {
    [UIView animateWithDuration:5 animations:^{
        _addBannerDistanceFromBottomConstraint.constant = 0;
    }];
    bannerIsVisible = TRUE;
}
And the banner moves, exactly as expected, but no animation.
UPDATE: I re-watched WWDC 12 talk Best Practices for Mastering Auto Layout which covers animation. It discusses how to update constraints using CoreAnimation:
I've tried with the following code, but get the exact same results:
- (void)moveBannerOffScreen {
    _addBannerDistanceFromBottomConstraint.constant = -32;
    [UIView animateWithDuration:2 animations:^{
        [self.view setNeedsLayout];
    }];
    bannerIsVisible = FALSE;
}
- (void)moveBannerOnScreen {
    _addBannerDistanceFromBottomConstraint.constant = 0;
    [UIView animateWithDuration:2 animations:^{
        [self.view setNeedsLayout];
    }];
    bannerIsVisible = TRUE;
}
On a side note, I have checked numerous times and this is being executed on the main thread.

"Difference Between Select and SelectMany
I've been searching the difference between Select and SelectMany but I haven't been able to find a suitable answer. I need to learn the difference when using LINQ To SQL but all I've found are standard array examples. 
Can someone provide a LINQ To SQL example?
"	958949	"Select and SelectMany are LINQ extension methods that allow you to transform elements in a sequence.

Select is used to project each element of a sequence into a new form, such as selecting specific properties of an object. In LINQ to SQL, you can use Select to select specific columns of a database table and create a new sequence of anonymous types with those columns.

Here's an example:

csharp

using (var db = new MyDataContext())
{
    var query = from customer in db.Customers
                select new { customer.FirstName, customer.LastName };

    foreach (var item in query)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(""{0} {1}"", item.FirstName, item.LastName);
    }
}

SelectMany is used to flatten a sequence of sequences into a single sequence. In LINQ to SQL, you can use SelectMany to select multiple columns from multiple tables and create a new sequence of anonymous types with those columns.

Here's an example:

csharp

using (var db = new MyDataContext())
{
    var query = from customer in db.Customers
                from order in customer.Orders
                select new { customer.FirstName, customer.LastName, order.OrderDate };

    foreach (var item in query)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(""{0} {1} - {2}"", item.FirstName, item.LastName, item.OrderDate);
    }
}

In this example, the SelectMany method is used to flatten the sequence of orders for each customer into a single sequence of anonymous types with customer first and last names and order date."	eu.60e8b668-d8a1-4358-9826-7b501d63a622				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e143d7876ea74d13f08c0f	00023de272--63dfab986adb8b18a55bacc6	00023de272--63e143d7876ea74d13f08c0f	d8e61a54e640dc786924fbd68be12067	APPROVED	2023-02-06T18:15:51.828	+	
"Cycles in family tree software
I am the developer of some family tree software (written in C++ and Qt). I had no problems until one of my customers mailed me a bug report. The problem is that the customer has two children with their own daughter, and, as a result, he can't use my software because of errors.
Those errors are the result of my various assertions and invariants about the family graph being processed (for example, after walking a cycle, the program states that X can't be both father and grandfather of Y).
How can I resolve those errors without removing all data assertions?
"	6163683	To resolve the errors in your family tree software without removing data assertions, you can modify your code to handle cycles in the family graph. You can implement a cycle detection algorithm (such as Depth-first Search or Tarjan's algorithm) to detect the presence of a cycle and avoid processing it further. Once a cycle is detected, you can display a warning message to the user and prevent the creation of any new relationships that would cause cycles in the family graph. Additionally, you may want to consider updating your data assertions to account for the possibility of cycles in the family graph, as they can provide important information about the validity of the data being processed.	eu.26256bb7-026c-4a1b-b9c5-0de29ef45d23				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e1444155593637d4b27bcf	00023de272--63dfab916adb8b18a55baa61	00023de272--63e1444155593637d4b27bcf	d8e61a54e640dc786924fbd68be12067	APPROVED	2023-02-06T18:17:37.062	+

Copy code
let element = document.querySelector('.span');
element.style.setProperty('--content', 'bar');
And in your CSS:

Copy code
.span::after {
  content: var(--content);
}
Similarly, using jQuery:

"How do you use bcrypt for hashing passwords in PHP?
Every now and then I hear the advice ""Use bcrypt for storing passwords in PHP, bcrypt rules"".
But what is bcrypt? PHP doesn't offer any such functions, Wikipedia babbles about a file-encryption utility and Web searches just reveal a few implementations of Blowfish in different languages. Now Blowfish is also available in PHP via mcrypt, but how does that help with storing passwords? Blowfish is a general purpose cipher, it works two ways. If it could be encrypted, it can be decrypted. Passwords need a one-way hashing function.
What is the explanation?
"	4795385	"Bcrypt is a password hashing function that uses the Blowfish symmetric-key block cipher algorithm. Bcrypt was specifically designed for password hashing and provides a number of benefits over other password hashing algorithms, including being slow and difficult to attack with brute-force methods.

To use bcrypt in PHP, you can use the password_hash() function, which is included in PHP 5.5 and later. This function takes a plaintext password as input and returns a hashed password that can be safely stored in a database. When you want to check if a user-supplied password matches the hashed password stored in your database, you can use the password_verify() function.

Here is an example of how you can use bcrypt in PHP to hash a password and verify it:

php
Copy code
// Hashing a password
$password = ""mysecretpassword"";
$hashedPassword = password_hash($password, PASSWORD_BCRYPT);

// Verifying a password
$inputPassword = ""mysecretpassword"";
if (password_verify($inputPassword, $hashedPassword)) {
    echo ""Password is valid."";
} else {
    echo ""Password is invalid."";
}
Note that bcrypt is considered to be a secure method for password storage and you should always use it or a similarly secure method for password storage."	eu.dfddcc34-d43c-466e-8399-a3193e8758fd				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e1534489576016d8e6c276	00023de272--63dfab976adb8b18a55bac8f	00023de272--63e1534489576016d8e6c276	286ce83192d264c83604997426952e82	APPROVED	2023-02-06T19:21:40.454	+

"Why can't I use switch statement on a String?
Is this functionality going to be put into a later Java version?
Can someone explain why I can't do this, as in, the technical way Java's switch statement works?
"	338206	"Before Java 7, switch statement could only operate on primitive data types (such as int, char, and byte) and not on objects, including Strings.

Starting from Java 7, the switch statement was updated to support Strings as well. However, this is implemented in a way that requires the Strings to be interned, i.e., their memory addresses are compared rather than their contents.

The technical reason for this design choice is that, the switch statement uses a hash table internally, where the input expression is hashed to determine the case label to jump to. Comparing two objects for equality using the ""equals"" method can be much slower than just comparing their memory addresses, so this would be inefficient to use in a switch statement.

So, Java developers decided to support only interned Strings in switch statement to maintain efficiency."	eu.bc78cfbf-6eaf-475f-a4f3-9c25f5646411				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e15dafd9b645131c2f67ee	00023de272--63dfaba16adb8b18a55bafb1	00023de272--63e15dafd9b645131c2f67ee	d8e61a54e640dc786924fbd68be12067	APPROVED	2023-02-06T20:06:07.297	+

rather than:
Object myObject;

myObject.testFunc();

In C++, using pointers to objects can offer some performance benefits, such as better control over memory allocation and direct access to the memory address of the object. However, it also increases the complexity and potential for bugs in your code, such as the need to manage memory allocation and deallocation manually and being mindful of null pointers.

It's worth noting that using pointers is generally not required and it depends on the specific use case and design of your program. In many cases, using objects directly is a simpler and more straightforward approach.

"Why do we need virtual functions in C++?
I'm learning C++ and I'm just getting into virtual functions.

But earlier in the book, when learning about basic inheritance, I was able to override base functions in derived classes without using virtual.
So what am I missing here? I know there is more to virtual functions, and it seems to be important so I want to be clear on what it is exactly. I just can't find a straightforward answer online.
"	2391679	Virtual functions in C++ allow you to specify a base class function that can be redefined in derived classes. The main purpose of virtual functions is to enable dynamic dispatch, which is the ability of the program to call the correct overridden function at runtime, based on the actual type of the object, rather than the type of the reference or pointer to the base class. This is important for maintaining correct behavior in scenarios where you have a collection of objects of different types, all of which are referred to by a reference or pointer to the base class type. In such cases, without virtual functions, the base class implementation would always be called, even if an object of a derived type is actually being referred to.	eu.a8872045-1e37-4890-a1eb-359145fb3aef				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e1613555593637d4b526e5	00023de272--63dfab916adb8b18a55baa58	00023de272--63e1613555593637d4b526e5	d8e61a54e640dc786924fbd68be12067	APPROVED	2023-02-06T20:21:09.580	+

"application/x-www-form-urlencoded or multipart/form-data?
In HTTP there are two ways to POST data: application/x-www-form-urlencoded and multipart/form-data. I understand that most browsers are only able to upload files if multipart/form-data is used. Is there any additional guidance when to use one of the encoding types in an API context (no browser involved)? This might e.g. be based on:
data size
existence of non-ASCII characters
existence on (unencoded) binary data
the need to transfer additional data (like filename)
I basically found no formal guidance on the web regarding the use of the different content-types so far.
"	4007969	"""application/x-www-form-urlencoded"" is usually used when posting simple data that can be encoded as key-value pairs. The data is encoded as key-value pairs separated by '&' symbols, with keys and values separated by '='. This type of encoding is suitable for ASCII characters only.

""multipart/form-data"" is used when posting binary data, or non-ASCII data, such as a file. This encoding allows for the inclusion of additional information like the file name. It is also suitable for posting larger amounts of data as it supports chunking and resuming the transfer.

In API context, if you're sending simple text data, you can use ""application/x-www-form-urlencoded"". If you're sending binary data, such as a file, or non-ASCII data, then ""multipart/form-data"" is more suitable. If in doubt, you can use ""multipart/form-data"" as it's more versatile."	eu.8dd94b70-6fe6-4414-99a5-506385fec59f				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e1668cf24cb959b9338751	00023de272--63dfab916adb8b18a55baa68	00023de272--63e1668cf24cb959b9338751	d8e61a54e640dc786924fbd68be12067	APPROVED	2023-02-06T20:43:56.595	+

"Can you force a React component to rerender without calling setState?
I have an external (to the component), observable object that I want to listen for changes on. When the object is updated it emits change events, and then I want to rerender the component when any change is detected.
With a top-level React.render this has been possible, but within a component it doesn't work (which makes some sense since the render method just returns an object).
Here's a code example:
export default class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  handleButtonClick() {
    this.render();
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        {Math.random()}
        <button onClick={this.handleButtonClick.bind(this)}>
          Click me
        </button>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
Clicking the button internally calls this.render(), but that's not what actually causes the rendering to happen (you can see this in action because the text created by {Math.random()} doesn't change). However, if I simply call this.setState() instead of this.render(), it works fine.
So I guess my question is: do React components need to have state in order to rerender? Is there a way to force the component to update on demand without changing the state?
"	30626030	React components only rerender when their state or props change. To force a component to rerender without changing the state, you can call this.forceUpdate(). However, it's usually better to change the state or props in a way that triggers a rerender, rather than relying on forceUpdate. This is because React uses the state and props to determine if a rerender is needed, so if the component's state or props aren't changed, React won't know that the component needs to rerender.	eu.8eaa79ba-516a-423f-8a83-cabeec5d1651				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e16973bbed6c706eb400fd	00023de272--63dfaba26adb8b18a55bb02d	00023de272--63e16973bbed6c706eb400fd	d8e61a54e640dc786924fbd68be12067	APPROVED	2023-02-06T20:56:19.222	+

"Naming Classes - How to avoid calling everything a ""<WhatEver>Manager""?
A long time ago I have read an article (I believe a blog entry) which put me on the ""right"" track on naming objects: Be very very scrupulous about naming things in your program.
For example if my application was (as a typical business app) handling users, companies and addresses I'd have a User, a Company and an Address domain class - and probably somewhere a UserManager, a CompanyManager and an AddressManager would pop up that handles those things.
So can you tell what those UserManager, CompanyManager and AddressManager do? No, because Manager is a very very generic term that fits to anything you can do with your domain objects.
The article I read recommended using very specific names. If it was a C++ application and the UserManager's job was allocating and freeing users from the heap it would not manage the users but guard their birth and death. Hmm, maybe we could call this a UserShepherd.
Or maybe the UserManager's job is to examine each User object's data and sign the data cryptographically. Then we'd have a UserRecordsClerk.
Now that this idea stuck with me I try to apply it. And find this simple idea amazingly hard.
I can describe what the classes do and (as long as I don't slip into quick & dirty coding) the classes I write do exactly one thing. What I miss to go from that description to the names is a kind of catalogue of names, a vocabulary that maps the concepts to names.
Ultimately I'd like to have something like a pattern catalogue in my mind (frequently design patterns easily provide the object names, e.g. a factory)
Factory - Creates other objects (naming taken from the design pattern)
Shepherd - A shepherd handles the lifetime of objects, their creation and shutdown
Synchronizer - Copies data between two or more objects (or object hierarchies)
Nanny - Helps objects reach ""usable"" state after creation - for example by wiring to other objects
etc etc.
So, how do you handle that issue? Do you have a fixed vocabulary, do you invent new names on the fly or do you consider naming things not-so-important or wrong?
P.S.: I'm also interested in links to articles and blogs discussing the issue. As a start, here is the original article that got me thinking about it: Naming Java Classes without a 'Manager'
Update: Summary of answers
Here's a little summary of what I learned from this question in the meantime.
Try not to create new metaphors (Nanny)
Have a look at what other frameworks do
Further articles/books on this topic:
What names do you find yourself prepending/appending to classes regularly? 
What’s the best approach to naming classes?

And a current list of name prefixes/suffixes I collected (subjectively!) from the answers:
Coordinator
Builder
Writer
Reader
Handler
Container
Protocol
Target
Converter
Controller
View
Factory
Entity
Bucket
And a good tip for the road:
  Don't get naming paralysis. Yes, names are very important but they're not important   enough to waste huge amounts of time on. If you can't think up a good name in 10 minutes, move on.
"	1866794	"When naming classes, it's best to choose descriptive, specific names that accurately reflect the purpose of the class. Avoid generic terms like ""Manager"" or ""Handler,"" as they don't provide enough information about what the class does. Instead, consider using names that describe the class's responsibilities, such as ""UserRecordsClerk"" or ""UserShepherd.""

"How do I split the definition of a long string over multiple lines?
I have a very long query. I would like to split it in several lines in Python. A way to do it in JavaScript would be using several sentences and joining them with a + operator (I know, maybe it's not the most efficient way to do it, but I'm not really concerned about performance in this stage, just code readability). Example:
var long_string = 'some text not important. just garbage to' +
                      'illustrate my example';
I tried doing something similar in Python, but it didn't work, so I used \ to split the long string. However, I'm not sure if this is the only/best/pythonicest way of doing it. It looks awkward.
Actual code:
query = 'SELECT action.descr as ""action"", '\
    'role.id as role_id,'\
    'role.descr as role'\
    'FROM '\
    'public.role_action_def,'\
    'public.role,'\

    'public.action'\
    'WHERE role.id = role_action_def.role_id AND'\

    'action.id = role_action_def.action_id AND'\

    'record_def.account_id=' + account_id + ' AND'\
    'def_id=' + def_id
"	10660435	"In Python, you can split a long string by enclosing it in parentheses and using the line continuation character (\) at the end of each line. This is the recommended way of splitting a long string in Python, and it is more readable than using multiple strings joined with a + operator.

I stumbled upon Stack Overflow question Memory leak with std::string when using std::list<std::string>, and one of the comments says this:
  Stop using new so much. I can't see any reason you used new anywhere
  you did. You can create objects by value in C++ and it's one of the
  huge advantages to using the language.
    You do not have to allocate
  everything on the heap.

"	6500313	"In C++, objects can be created either on the stack or on the heap using the ""new"" operator. Creating objects on the stack (also called ""by value"") is generally considered more efficient than creating them on the heap, because stack-allocated objects are automatically cleaned up when they go out of scope, while heap-allocated objects must be explicitly deallocated using the ""delete"" operator to avoid memory leaks.

By ""thinking like a Java programmer,"" the commenter is likely referring to the common practice in Java of creating all objects on the heap, which is not always necessary in C++. Java's garbage collector automatically reclaims memory occupied by unused objects, so developers don't have to worry about manual memory management as much as they do in C++.

In summary, it's often recommended to minimize use of the ""new"" operator in C++ in favor of creating objects by value to improve efficiency and avoid the potential for memory leaks."	eu.613a42ea-b379-4e9b-9004-be01fc8574e7				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e16f35876ea74d13f49bc2	00023de272--63dfaba76adb8b18a55bb19a	00023de272--63e16f35876ea74d13f49bc2	d8e61a54e640dc786924fbd68be12067	APPROVED	2023-02-06T21:20:53.829	+

"What is the difference between null=True and blank=True in Django?
When we add a model field in Django we generally write:

The same is done with ForeignKey, DecimalField etc. What is the basic difference between:
null=True only
blank=True only
null=True and blank=True
in respect to different (CharField, ForeignKey, ManyToManyField, DateTimeField) fields? What are the advantages/disadvantages of using option 1, 2, or 3?
"	8609192	"null and blank are two different arguments in Django model fields that determine the field's behavior with respect to database storage and form validation.

null - If set to True, it allows the field to be stored as NULL in the database. A NULL value in the database means that the value of the field is unknown or missing. By default, fields in Django are not nullable, so the value must be provided.

blank - If set to True, it allows the field to be left blank in forms. This means that the form validation will allow the field to be submitted as an empty value. By default, fields are not required to be filled in forms.

The difference between the two options are:

    null=True: it only affects the database and allows the value to be stored as NULL.
    blank=True: it only affects form validation and allows the field to be left blank in forms.

null=True and blank=True can be used together, in which case the field is allowed to be stored as NULL in the database and also left blank in forms.

Advantages/Disadvantages of using the options:

"Maintain the aspect ratio of a div with CSS
I want to create a div that can change its width/height as the window's width changes.
Are there any CSS3 rules that would allow the height to change according to the width, while maintaining its aspect ratio?
I know I can do this via JavaScript, but I would prefer using only CSS.
"	1495407	"Yes, you can use CSS3 rules to maintain the aspect ratio of a div while changing its width/height. One way to achieve this is by using the ""padding-bottom"" or ""padding-top"" property with a percentage value. The percentage value represents the aspect ratio you want to maintain. For example, if you want a 4:3 aspect ratio, you can set the padding-bottom property to 75%.

Here's an example:

css

.responsive-box {
  position: relative;
  width: 100%;
  padding-bottom: 75%; /* 4:3 aspect ratio */
}

.responsive-box::before {
  content: """";
  display: block;
  padding-top: 100%;
}

This works because padding is calculated as a percentage of the parent element's width. By setting the padding-bottom to 75%, you are effectively setting the height of the element to 75% of its width, maintaining a 4:3 aspect ratio."	eu.4a31fffb-4c69-4cd3-8ff4-0ae228f36ab2				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e170628ce4d97cdcdcdb29	00023de272--63dfab956adb8b18a55bac12	00023de272--63e170628ce4d97cdcdcdb29	d8e61a54e640dc786924fbd68be12067	APPROVED	2023-02-06T21:25:54.527	+

"Auto Scale TextView Text to Fit within Bounds
I'm looking for an optimal way to resize wrapping text in a TextView so that it will fit within its getHeight and getWidth bounds. I'm not simply looking for a way to wrap the text- I want to make sure it both wraps and is small enough to fit entirely on the screen. 
I've seen a few cases on StackOverflow where auto resizing was needed, but they are either very special cases with hack solutions, have no solution, or involve re-drawing the TextView recursively until it is small enough (which is memory intense and forces the user to watch the text shrink step-by-step with every recursion). 
But I'm sure somebody out there has found a good solution that doesn't involve what I'm doing: writing several heavy routines that parse and measure the text, resize the text, and repeat until a suitably small size has been found. 
What routines does TextView use to wrap the text? Couldn't those be somehow used to predict whether text will be small enough?
tl;dr: is there a best-practice way to auto-resize a TextView to fit, wrapped, in its getHeight and getWidth bounds?
"	5033012	"You can set textSize programmatically and use TextView.getPaint().measureText(text) to get the width of the text in pixels. Then, compare it with the width of the TextView and adjust the text size until it fits within the bounds. Here's a simple example in Java:

TextView textView = findViewById(R.id.text_view);
String text = textView.getText().toString();
float textSize = textView.getTextSize();
Paint paint = textView.getPaint();

while (paint.measureText(text) > textView.getWidth()) {
    textSize--;
    paint.setTextSize(textSize);
}
textView.setTextSize(TypedValue.COMPLEX_UNIT_PX, textSize);

This solution doesn't account for the height of the TextView, so you may need to modify it to also consider the height of the TextView and adjust the text size accordingly.

"	1497958	"Vim registers are storage locations where you can save and retrieve text. They can be used to store yanked text, deleted text, and more. Some common uses of Vim registers include:

Yanking text: To yank text into a register, use the ""y"" command followed by a motion command, such as ""yw"" to yank a word or ""yy"" to yank a line. The text is stored in the default register, which can be pasted using the ""p"" command.

Deleting text: To delete text into a register, use the ""d"" command followed by a motion command, such as ""dw"" to delete a word or ""dd"" to delete a line. The deleted text is stored in the default register.

Named registers: Vim supports named registers, which are used to store text in specific locations for later use. Named registers can be specified using double quotes, for example, ""a to yank text into register ""a"". To paste text from a named register, use ""Ctrl-R"" followed by the name of the register, for example, ""Ctrl-R a"".

Append to a register: To append text to a register, use the ""A"" command followed by the register name, for example, ""A a"" to append text to register ""a"".

Macros: Vim supports macros, which are sequences of commands that can be saved and reused later. Macros can be recorded into a register using the ""qa"" command, followed by the desired commands, and ended with the ""q"" command. The macro can then be executed by typing ""@"" followed by the register name, for example, ""@a"".

Using the unnamed register: The unnamed register is a special register that holds the text of the most recent yank or delete operation. You can paste from the unnamed register using the ""p"" command.

These are just a few examples of how Vim registers can be used.

So, I'm not asking for removing untagged images only. I'm searching for a way to remove general unused images, which includes both untagged and other images such as pulled months ago with correct TAG.
"	32723111	"To remove all unused Docker images, you can use the following command:

perl

docker system prune

This will remove all unused images, containers, networks, and volumes.

If you want to remove all images that were pulled more than a certain number of days ago, you can use the --filter option:

python

docker image prune --filter ""until=30d""

This will remove all images that haven't been used in the last 30 days. Replace ""30d"" with the number of days you want to keep images for.

Note: Before removing any images, make sure that you don't need them anymore and that they aren't being used by any containers.

I have a limited exposure to DB and have only used DB as an application programmer. I want to know about Clustered and Non clustered indexes.

  A clustered index is a special type of index that reorders  the way

  one clustered index. The leaf  nodes
  of a clustered index contain the data
  pages. A nonclustered index is a

  nodes contain index rows.

"	1251636	"A clustered index determines the physical order of data in a database table, meaning it determines how the data is stored on disk. A table can have only one clustered index, as the physical order of the data can only be determined once. The leaf nodes of a clustered index contain the actual data rows.

A non-clustered index, on the other hand, is a separate structure from the table that holds a copy of the data from one or more columns of the table. The leaf nodes of a non-clustered index contain the index rows, which have the key values and a pointer to the actual data rows in the table. The logical order of a non-clustered index is different from the physical order of the data on disk, as it's determined by the order of the key values in the index.

To simplify: A clustered index physically re-arranges the data in a table, while a non-clustered index provides a separate structure to search data efficiently, but the data remains unchanged physically."	eu.90aa4b8d-f45f-4718-a85f-6c412a823535				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e176adbbed6c706eb50e62	00023de272--63dfab9a6adb8b18a55bad6b	00023de272--63e176adbbed6c706eb50e62	420edf6930f74d245330296489f788e8	APPROVED	2023-02-06T21:52:45.453	+

a. Create a separate HTTP server for each website that needs it. Then load all JavaScript code at the start of the program, so the code is interpreted once.
b. Create one single Node.js server which handles all Node.js requests. This reads the requested files and evals their contents. So the files are interpreted on each request, but the server logic is much simpler.

"	5009324	"Node.js is typically used for creating server-side applications and Nginx is a popular web server used for serving static content and proxying requests to other servers.

When using Node.js and Nginx together, a common setup is to have Nginx handle static file requests and proxy requests for dynamic content to a Node.js application. This allows Nginx to handle the high performance needs of serving static files and frees up the Node.js server to handle the dynamic content.

Regarding the two concepts, it depends on the use case. If you have multiple websites with different requirements, it's better to create a separate Node.js server for each website. This allows you to customize the server for each website, as well as provide isolation between the different applications. However, if all the websites have similar requirements, a single Node.js server can handle all requests.

In either case, it's recommended to have a reverse proxy like Nginx in front of the Node.js server to handle load balancing, SSL termination, and other performance-related tasks."	eu.8ed1b05b-1311-480e-88eb-2b2e2f222ddf				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e177ecfaab2d703d7c784d	00023de272--63dfab9c6adb8b18a55bae51	00023de272--63e177ecfaab2d703d7c784d	420edf6930f74d245330296489f788e8	APPROVED	2023-02-06T21:58:04.351	+

variable=0
variable=1
To update the variable, use the same syntax.

For using the Boolean variable in an expression, you can use the following syntax:

"Does functional programming replace GoF design patterns?
Since I started learning F# and OCaml last year, I've read a huge number of articles which insist that design patterns (especially in Java) are workarounds for the missing features in imperative languages. One article I found makes a fairly strong claim:
  Most people I've met have read 
  the Design Patterns book by the Gang of
  Four (GoF). Any self respecting programmer
  will tell you that the book is
  language agnostic and the patterns
  apply to software engineering in
  general, regardless of which language
  you use. This is a noble claim.
  Unfortunately it is far removed from
  the truth.
  Functional languages are extremely
  expressive. In a functional language
  one does not need design patterns
  because the language is likely so high
  level, you end up programming in
  concepts that eliminate design
  patterns all together.
The main features of functional programming (FP) include functions as first-class values, currying, immutable values, etc. It doesn't seem obvious to me that OO design patterns are approximating any of those features.
Additionally, in functional languages which support OOP (such as F# and OCaml), it seems obvious to me that programmers using these languages would use the same design patterns found available to every other OOP language. In fact, right now I use F# and OCaml every day, and there are no striking differences between the patterns I use in these languages vs. the patterns I use when I write in Java.
Is there any truth to the claim that functional programming eliminates the need for OOP design patterns? If so, could you post or link to an example of a typical OOP design pattern and its functional equivalent?
"	327955	"No, functional programming does not replace GoF design patterns. Design patterns are a general solution to common software design problems, regardless of the programming paradigm used. While functional programming has different language features and idioms, it does not eliminate the need for design patterns. In fact, some design patterns can be reinterpreted in a functional style, but the essence of the pattern remains the same.

For example, the Factory Method pattern in OOP creates objects without specifying the exact class of the object to be created. In a functional language, the same pattern can be achieved by using higher-order functions and partial function application to construct objects.

In conclusion, while functional programming has its own set of language features and idioms, it does not eliminate the need for design patterns. Design patterns are a general solution to common software design problems that can be adapted to different programming paradigms, including functional programming."	eu.e4f59ab8-913c-4223-823c-add5bf068123				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e17b7bfaab2d703d7cab18	00023de272--63dfab9c6adb8b18a55bae39	00023de272--63e17b7bfaab2d703d7cab18	420edf6930f74d245330296489f788e8	APPROVED	2023-02-06T22:13:15.509	+

Observables, on the other hand, are a pattern for dealing with multiple events over time. Observables are used to handle a stream of values that arrive over time, and can be observed and manipulated. An observable can emit multiple values over its lifetime and can be used to handle complex asynchronous events.

Here's an example of using an Observable in Angular:

javascript
Copy code
import { interval } from 'rxjs';

let observable = interval(1000);

observable.subscribe(value => console.log(`Hello from Observable! ${value}`));
In general, you can use Promises when you need to handle a single event, and you can use Observables when you need to handle multiple events over time. Promises are better for simple use cases, while Observables are more powerful for complex use cases."	eu.88153bdf-66f6-4a9c-a8b9-de51974eb6db				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e17d31fe2572323d1a6405	00023de272--63dfab8b6adb8b18a55ba866	00023de272--63e17d31fe2572323d1a6405	420edf6930f74d245330296489f788e8	APPROVED	2023-02-06T22:20:33.057	+

"Hex transparency in colors
I'm working on implementing a widget transparency option for my app widget although I'm having some trouble getting the hex color values right. Being completely new to hex color transparency I searched around a bit although I couldn't find a specific answer to my question. 
I want to set transparency by hex color so let's say my hex color id ""#33b5e5"" and I want it to be 50% transparent. Then I'll use ""#8033b5e5"" because 80 is 50%. 
I found a useful chart here: http://www.dtp-aus.com/hexadeci.htm . With this data I managed to come up with this:
0% = #00
10% = #16
20% = #32
30% = #48
40% = #64
50% = #80
60% = #96
70% = #112
80% = #128
90% = #144
Now the issues start appearing when I get higher than 100 in hex. Hex color codes can only be 8 symbols long right? For example #11233b5e5 (80%) crashes.
What can I do to enable me to use the higher numbers aswell?
"	15852122	The first two characters in a hex color code represent the opacity value (also called alpha value). The value of 00 means fully transparent and FF means fully opaque. The range of values is from 00 to FF, so you can only set opacity values in increments of 1/255 (or approximately 0.4%). To set 50% transparency, the correct hex code would be #8033B5E5. If you need to set transparency values in increments greater than 0.4%, you would need to use a different color representation format, such as RGBA (Red Green Blue Alpha), which allows you to set opacity values in decimal form, with a range of 0 to 1.	eu.111bb840-7bca-4cd9-9b60-39a771736849				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e17ee3a483b403895cbd58	00023de272--63dfab946adb8b18a55babaf	00023de272--63e17ee3a483b403895cbd58	420edf6930f74d245330296489f788e8	APPROVED	2023-02-06T22:27:47.903	+

What is the best way to generate a string of \t's in C#

Tabs(uint t) is a function that returns a string with t amount of \t's
For example Tabs(3) returns ""\t\t\t""
Which of these three ways of implementing Tabs(uint numTabs) is best?
Of course that depends on what ""best"" means.
The LINQ version is only two lines, which is nice.  But are the calls to Repeat and Aggregate unnecessarily time/resource consuming?
The StringBuilder version is very clear but is the StringBuilder class somehow slower?
The string version is basic, which means it is easy to understand.
Does it not matter at all?  Are they all equal?
These are all questions to help me get a better feel for C#.

All three implementations produce the same result and the choice between them depends on the particular use case, readability, and performance requirements.	eu.990863be-5b34-41d4-ab4b-fed210db6a96				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e181818d80e40a93d3e805	00023de272--63dfaba76adb8b18a55bb176	00023de272--63e181818d80e40a93d3e805	d8e61a54e640dc786924fbd68be12067	APPROVED	2023-02-06T22:38:57.542	+

A system that implements reactive programming has components that can react to changes in the inputs and produce new outputs. In other words, the system automatically updates its behavior in response to changes.

Functional reactive programming (FRP) is a specific type of reactive programming that builds on functional programming concepts, such as immutability and pure functions. It allows developers to express complex dynamic interactions between inputs and outputs in a declarative and composable manner, without relying on stateful variables and manual mutation.

In practice, reactive programming can be used to build applications with real-time or streaming data sources, such as games, financial trading systems, or streaming services. By treating values as streams of data, reactive programming makes it possible to handle large amounts of data with high performance, scalability, and reliability.

Compared to non-reactive programming, reactive programming shifts the focus from managing state updates to defining the relationships between inputs and outputs. Instead of using imperative code to write explicit updates, reactive programming uses declarative code to describe how inputs affect outputs, and lets the system handle the updates automatically."	eu.b8ccc300-7b9d-4373-9da9-1c03a9599449				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e18482f7d97f70449c616f	00023de272--63dfab9b6adb8b18a55bae07	00023de272--63e18482f7d97f70449c616f	420edf6930f74d245330296489f788e8	APPROVED	2023-02-06T22:51:46.238	+

"push_back vs emplace_back
I'm a bit confused regarding the difference between push_back and emplace_back.
void emplace_back(Type&& _Val);
void push_back(const Type& _Val);
void push_back(Type&& _Val);
As there is a push_back overload taking a rvalue reference I don't quite see what the purpose of emplace_back becomes?
"	4303513	"push_back appends an element to the end of a container (e.g. a vector) by creating a copy of the input value and storing that copy in the container.

emplace_back on the other hand constructs the object in-place within the container, without creating a copy. This is more efficient when creating an object requires significant time and resources, as it avoids copying.

The difference between push_back(Type&& _Val) and emplace_back(Type&& _Val) is subtle, but emplace_back is preferred over push_back(Type&& _Val) because the former does not make a copy of the argument and thus is more efficient. The emplace_back function creates an object within the container by directly calling the constructor with the arguments provided, instead of constructing an object outside of the container and then copying it in.

So, in short, you should use emplace_back instead of push_back if you want to construct an object in-place within a container, as it is more efficient and avoids unnecessary copies."	eu.04341aab-0285-46e9-bbfc-e0f8fbce7292				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e18544a483b403895d56ec	00023de272--63dfab9e6adb8b18a55baef6	00023de272--63e18544a483b403895d56ec	420edf6930f74d245330296489f788e8	APPROVED	2023-02-06T22:55:00.876	+

"	107390	"The main difference between a POST and a PUT request is the purpose for which the data is being sent.

POST requests are typically used when you want to submit data to a server for further processing, such as uploading a file, submitting a form, etc. It's used to create a new resource on the server.

PUT requests are typically used when you want to update an existing resource on the server. It replaces the resource in its entirety.

In other words, POST is used to create a resource, while PUT is used to update a resource. Additionally, PUT requests are idempotent, meaning that multiple identical PUT requests should have the same effect as a single request, while POST requests may have side-effects and are not idempotent."	eu.30227b98-be71-4e08-b956-fcbd776f3ba4				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e18591876ea74d13f6381f	00023de272--63dfaba26adb8b18a55bb01a	00023de272--63e18591876ea74d13f6381f	420edf6930f74d245330296489f788e8	APPROVED	2023-02-06T22:56:17.097	+

"'this' vs $scope in AngularJS controllers
In the ""Create Components"" section of AngularJS's homepage, there is this example:
controller: function($scope, $element) {
  var panes = $scope.panes = [];
  $scope.select = function(pane) {
    angular.forEach(panes, function(pane) {
      pane.selected = false;
    });
    pane.selected = true;
  }
  this.addPane = function(pane) {
    if (panes.length == 0) $scope.select(pane);
    panes.push(pane);
  }
}
Notice how the select method is added to $scope, but the addPane method is added to this. If I change it to $scope.addPane, the code breaks.
The documentation says that there in fact is a difference, but it doesn't mention what the difference is:
  Previous versions of Angular (pre 1.0 RC) allowed you to use this interchangeably with the $scope method, but this is no longer the case. Inside of methods defined on the scope this and $scope are interchangeable (angular sets this to $scope), but not otherwise inside your controller constructor.
How does this and $scope work in AngularJS controllers?
"	11605917	"this and $scope in AngularJS controllers refer to different objects. In AngularJS, the this keyword inside a controller refers to the controller instance, while $scope is the object that represents the scope of the controller and holds the data that can be displayed in the view.

In the example, the select method is added to $scope because it is meant to be used in the view. The addPane method is added to this because it is meant to be used only within the controller. When AngularJS creates an instance of the controller, it sets this to be equal to $scope so that you can access properties and methods on the scope directly from this. However, when you are outside the controller instance, this and $scope refer to different objects.

In summary, the difference between this and $scope in AngularJS controllers is that this refers to the controller instance while $scope refers to the object that represents the scope of the controller."	eu.b47138a7-d318-4b4a-82b0-daf371fbf14a				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e186c8f24cb959b935a8f1	00023de272--63dfaba06adb8b18a55baf8f	00023de272--63e186c8f24cb959b935a8f1	420edf6930f74d245330296489f788e8	APPROVED	2023-02-06T23:01:28.223	+

"Peak detection in a 2D array
I'm helping a veterinary clinic measuring pressure under a dogs paw. I use Python for my data analysis and now I'm stuck trying to divide the paws into (anatomical) subregions.
I made a 2D array of each paw, that consists of the maximal values for each sensor that has been loaded by the paw over time. Here's an example of one paw, where I used Excel to draw the areas I want to 'detect'. These are 2 by 2 boxes around the sensor with local maxima's, that together have the largest sum.
So I tried some experimenting and decide to simply look for the maximums of each column and row (can't look in one direction due to the shape of the paw). This seems to 'detect' the location of the separate toes fairly well, but it also marks neighboring sensors.
So what would be the best way to tell Python which of these maximums are the ones I want?
Note: The 2x2 squares can't overlap, since they have to be separate toes!
Also I took 2x2 as a convenience, any more advanced solution is welcome, but I'm simply a human movement scientist, so I'm neither a real programmer or a mathematician, so please keep it 'simple'.
Here's a version that can be loaded with np.loadtxt
Results
So I tried @jextee's solution (see the results below). As you can see, it works very on the front paws, but it works less well for the hind legs.
More specifically, it can't recognize the small peak that's the fourth toe. This is obviously inherent to the fact that the loop looks top down towards the lowest value, without taking into account where this is.
Would anyone know how to tweak @jextee's algorithm, so that it might be able to find the 4th toe too?
Since I haven't processed any other trials yet, I can't supply any other samples. But the data I gave before were the averages of each paw. This file is an array with the maximal data of 9 paws in the order they made contact with the plate.
This image shows how they were spatially spread out over the plate.
Update:
I have set up a blog for anyone interested and I have setup a OneDrive with all the raw measurements. So to anyone requesting more data: more power to you!
New update:
So after the help I got with my questions regarding paw detection and paw sorting, I was finally able to check the toe detection for every paw! Turns out, it doesn't work so well in anything but paws sized like the one in my own example. Off course in hindsight, it's my own fault for choosing the 2x2 so arbitrarily.
Here's a nice example of where it goes wrong: a nail is being recognized as a toe and the 'heel' is so wide, it gets recognized twice!
The paw is too large, so taking a 2x2 size with no overlap, causes some toes to be detected twice. The other way around, in small dogs it often fails to find a 5th toe, which I suspect is being caused by the 2x2 area being too large.
After trying the current solution on all my measurements I came to the staggering conclusion that for nearly all my small dogs it didn't find a 5th toe and that in over 50% of the impacts for the large dogs it would find more!
So clearly I need to change it. My own guess was changing the size of the neighborhood to something smaller for small dogs and larger for large dogs. But generate_binary_structure wouldn't let me change the size of the array.
Therefore, I'm hoping that anyone else has a better suggestion for locating the toes, perhaps having the toe area scale with the paw size?
"	3684484	"A possible solution could be to use image processing techniques such as blob detection or connected component labeling. The basic idea is to convert the 2D array into a binary image where the local maxima pixels are set to 1 and the rest to 0. Then, use a morphological operation, such as dilation, to expand the local maxima regions. Finally, label the connected regions using connected component labeling and select the regions with a certain size threshold as the toes.

Here's an example implementation using scikit-image:

python
Copy code
from skimage import morphology, measure
import numpy as np

def detect_toes(data, size_threshold=4):
    # Create binary image from the 2D array

    # Connected component labeling
    labeled = measure.label(dilated)
    regions = measure.regionprops(labeled)

    # Select regions with size greater than the threshold
    toes = [r.coords for r in regions if r.area >= size_threshold]
    return toes

"	3220404	"There are several reasons why pip is preferred over easy_install:

pip has better command line options and more user-friendly output compared to easy_install.

pip has better package management features, such as the ability to manage virtual environments, show the installed packages, and uninstall packages.

pip uses PyPI (Python Package Index) as the default source for packages, which has better security and quality control compared to other sources that easy_install might use.

pip is more widely used and better supported in the Python community, so it is easier to find help and solutions to problems online.

In short, pip provides a more modern and user-friendly experience for installing and managing Python packages. While both pip and easy_install can fail if a package has poor quality or is missing important files, pip is generally considered a more reliable and recommended tool for package management in the Python community."	eu.0f682891-a593-4fac-9da8-fba0d27cbe7d				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e188d88677d40ccc70dd45	00023de272--63dfaba86adb8b18a55bb1a9	00023de272--63e188d88677d40ccc70dd45	420edf6930f74d245330296489f788e8	APPROVED	2023-02-06T23:10:16.225	+

"Image Processing: Algorithm Improvement for 'Coca-Cola Can' Recognition
One of the most interesting projects I've worked on in the past couple of years was a project about image processing. The goal was to develop a system to be able to recognize Coca-Cola 'cans' (note that I'm stressing the word 'cans', you'll see why in a minute). You can see a sample below, with the can recognized in the green rectangle with scale and rotation.
Some constraints on the project:
The background could be very noisy.
The can could have any scale or rotation or even orientation (within reasonable limits).
The image could have some degree of fuzziness (contours might not be entirely straight).
There could be Coca-Cola bottles in the image, and the algorithm should only detect the can!
The brightness of the image could vary a lot (so you can't rely ""too much"" on color detection).
The can could be partly hidden on the sides or the middle and possibly partly hidden behind a bottle.
There could be no can at all in the image, in which case you had to find nothing and write a message saying so.
So you could end up with tricky things like this (which in this case had my algorithm totally fail):
I did this project a while ago, and had a lot of fun doing it, and I had a decent implementation. Here are some details about my implementation:
Language: Done in C++ using OpenCV library.
Pre-processing: For the image pre-processing, i.e. transforming the image into a more raw form to give to the algorithm, I used 2 methods:
Changing color domain from RGB to HSV and filtering based on ""red"" hue, saturation above a certain threshold to avoid orange-like colors, and filtering of low value to avoid dark tones. The end result was a binary black and white image, where all white pixels would represent the pixels that match this threshold. Obviously there is still a lot of crap in the image, but this reduces the number of dimensions you have to work with.
Noise filtering using median filtering (taking the median pixel value of all neighbors and replace the pixel by this value) to reduce noise.
Using Canny Edge Detection Filter to get the contours of all items after 2 precedent steps.
Algorithm: The algorithm itself I chose for this task was taken from this awesome book on feature extraction and called Generalized Hough Transform (pretty different from the regular Hough Transform). It basically says a few things:
You can describe an object in space without knowing its analytical equation (which is the case here).
It is resistant to image deformations such as scaling and rotation, as it will basically test your image for every combination of scale factor and rotation factor.
It uses a base model (a template) that the algorithm will ""learn"".
Each pixel remaining in the contour image will vote for another pixel which will supposedly be the center (in terms of gravity) of your object, based on what it learned from the model.
In the end, you end up with a heat map of the votes, for example here all the pixels of the contour of the can will vote for its gravitational center, so you'll have a lot of votes in the same pixel corresponding to the center, and will see a peak in the heat map as below:
Once you have that, a simple threshold-based heuristic can give you the location of the center pixel, from which you can derive the scale and rotation and then plot your little rectangle around it (final scale and rotation factor will obviously be relative to your original template). In theory at least...
Results: Now, while this approach worked in the basic cases, it was severely lacking in some areas:
It is extremely slow! I'm not stressing this enough. Almost a full day was needed to process the 30 test images, obviously because I had a very high scaling factor for rotation and translation, since some of the cans were very small.
It was completely lost when bottles were in the image, and for some reason almost always found the bottle instead of the can (perhaps because bottles were bigger, thus had more pixels, thus more votes)
Fuzzy images were also no good, since the votes ended up in pixel at random locations around the center, thus ending with a very noisy heat map.
In-variance in translation and rotation was achieved, but not in orientation, meaning that a can that was not directly facing the camera objective wasn't recognized.
Can you help me improve my specific algorithm, using exclusively OpenCV features, to resolve the four specific issues mentioned?
I hope some people will also learn something out of it as well, after all I think not only people who ask questions should learn. :)
"	10168686	"To improve the algorithm for Coca-Cola can recognition, consider the following steps:

Optimize the runtime: The Generalized Hough Transform is a computationally expensive method. One way to reduce the runtime is to use pyramid representation to reduce the size of the image and then apply the Hough Transform on the smaller images first. This will give you an approximate location of the can and you can then apply the Hough Transform on a small region of interest around the approximate location, which will give you the final result.

Handle the presence of bottles: To handle the presence of bottles, you can use object detection algorithms such as the Viola-Jones algorithm or Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) to detect the presence of both cans and bottles in the image. Then, use a classifier to distinguish between the two. This can help you reduce the false positives and improve the accuracy of the detection.

Improve the recognition of fuzzy images: One way to handle fuzzy images is to use a different edge detection algorithm such as the Structured Edge Detection algorithm or the Deep Edge Detection algorithm which are designed to handle such cases.

Improve orientation invariance: To improve orientation invariance, you can use an additional dimension in the Generalized Hough Transform that can represent the orientation of the object. Alternatively, you can use object detection algorithms that are invariant to orientation such as the RCNN family of algorithms or the YOLOv5 algorithm.

"Difference between require, include, require_once and include_once?
In PHP:
When should I use require vs. include?
When should I use require_once vs. include_once?
"	2418473	"The main difference between require and include is that require stops the execution of the program if the specified file can't be found, while include generates a warning and continues the execution of the program.

require_once and include_once work similarly, but the difference between them is that they make sure the specified file is included only once in the program. If the same file is included again later in the program, it will be ignored. This is useful to prevent function redefinition or variable declaration conflicts.

In general, it's recommended to use require instead of include when you need a file to be included and the execution of the program should stop if the file is missing. Use include when the file is optional and you want the program to continue executing even if it's missing. Use require_once or include_once when you need to include a file only once in the program."	eu.a2478201-fd9a-4c12-8195-84acd0fe96f9				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e18ef16b5f4256c3f6c47b	00023de272--63dfab956adb8b18a55babcb	00023de272--63e18ef16b5f4256c3f6c47b	420edf6930f74d245330296489f788e8	APPROVED	2023-02-06T23:36:17.340	+

To resolve the issue, try the following steps:

Verify if the Roslyn components are installed on your system.

If the components are installed but the application still can't find the compiler, check the path in the application configuration to ensure it points to the correct location of the csc.exe file.

Detection: Race conditions can be difficult to detect as they may only occur under specific conditions and are often hard to reproduce. One way to detect them is to use specialized tools such as a debugger or race detector. Another approach is to add logging statements or insert sleep statements to help force the race condition to occur.

Handling: There are several ways to handle race conditions including using locks to synchronize access to shared data, using atomic operations, or using the concept of lock-free programming.

Prevention: To prevent race conditions from occurring, you can use synchronization primitives such as locks, semaphores, or atomic operations to ensure that shared data is accessed in a controlled and synchronized manner. Another approach is to design your code to be lock-free, which means that multiple threads can access shared data without any locks, but this requires careful design and a deep understanding of the problem you're trying to solve."	eu.fb6f2c0a-e77d-4756-9ccd-4e7c346a9d7b				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e18ff08d80e40a93d4f7e9	00023de272--63dfab996adb8b18a55bad25	00023de272--63e18ff08d80e40a93d4f7e9	420edf6930f74d245330296489f788e8	APPROVED	2023-02-06T23:40:32.363	+

Properties, on the other hand, allow you to add logic to your constant values, such as computation or validation, and are appropriate if you need that level of control over the constant values.

"How does the 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header work?
Apparently, I have completely misunderstood its semantics. I thought of something like this:
A client downloads JavaScript code MyCode.js from http://siteA - the origin.
The response header of MyCode.js contains Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://siteB, which I thought meant that MyCode.js was allowed to make cross-origin references to the site B.
The client triggers some functionality of MyCode.js, which in turn make requests to http://siteB, which should be fine, despite being cross-origin requests.
Well, I am wrong. It does not work like this at all. So, I have read Cross-origin resource sharing and attempted to read Cross-Origin Resource Sharing in w3c recommendation.
One thing is sure - I still do not understand how I am supposed to use this header.

"	10636611	"The Access-Control-Allow-Origin header is used in response to a cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) request. It specifies which origin is allowed to access the resource, and the header must be included in the response of the server for the client's request to be successful.

To enable cross-origin resource sharing between site A and site B, you need to set Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://siteA in the response header of site B. This tells the browser that resources from site B are allowed to be accessed by scripts originating from site A.

Alternatively, if you want to allow all origins to access the resource, you can set Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *. Note that this is generally not recommended for security reasons.

In summary, to allow cross-origin resource sharing between two sites, you need to set the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header in the response of the server hosting the resource."	eu.86a27673-c51e-4e6c-8bea-c21a17902f80				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e191f28d80e40a93d513b1	00023de272--63dfab936adb8b18a55bab2a	00023de272--63e191f28d80e40a93d513b1	420edf6930f74d245330296489f788e8	APPROVED	2023-02-06T23:49:06.134	+

"Why use Redux over Facebook Flux?
I've read this answer, reducing boilerplate, looked at few GitHub examples and even tried redux a little bit (todo apps). 
As I understand, official redux doc motivations provide pros comparing to traditional MVC architectures. BUT it doesn't provide an answer to the question: 
Why you should use Redux over Facebook Flux? 
Is that only a question of programming styles: functional vs non-functional? Or the question is in abilities/dev-tools that follow from redux approach? Maybe scaling? Or testing?
Am I right if I say that redux is a flux for people who come from functional languages? 
To answer this question you may compare the complexity of implementation redux's motivation points on flux vs redux.
Here are motivation points from official redux doc motivations:
Handling optimistic updates (as I understand, it hardly depends on 5th point. Is it hard to implement it in facebook flux?)
Rendering on the server (facebook flux also can do this. Any benefits comparing to redux?)
Fetching data before performing route transitions (Why it can't be achieved in facebook flux? What's the benefits?)
Hot reload (It's possible with React Hot Reload. Why do we need redux?)
Undo/Redo functionality
Any other points? Like persisting state...
"	32461229	"Redux and Facebook Flux are both state management libraries for React applications. Here are some differences between the two:

Redux emphasizes functional programming principles, while Facebook Flux is more of an event-driven architecture.
Redux has a simpler and more predictable state management structure, where the state is stored in a single store, compared to Flux's multiple stores.
Redux makes it easier to implement features such as hot reloading, undo/redo functionality, and server rendering, compared to Flux.
Redux has a larger developer community and a wider range of tools and libraries available, such as middlewares and dev tools for debugging.
Redux's architecture is easier to test, as it has a clear structure for state management and actions.
So, in summary, you should use Redux over Facebook Flux if you want a simpler, more predictable, and easier-to-test state management library, and if you prefer functional programming principles. However, if you are already familiar and comfortable with the event-driven architecture of Facebook Flux, you may not see the need to switch to Redux."	eu.c2ed544d-9d04-47c6-9664-ad69bac41f7a				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e1937f55593637d4b85b35	00023de272--63dfab9c6adb8b18a55bae5b	00023de272--63e1937f55593637d4b85b35	d8e61a54e640dc786924fbd68be12067	APPROVED	2023-02-06T23:55:43.183	+

"Interface vs Abstract Class (general OO)
I have recently had two telephone interviews where I've been asked about the differences between an Interface and an Abstract class. I have explained every aspect of them I could think of, but it seems they are waiting for me to mention something specific, and I don't know what it is.
From my experience I think the following is true. If I am missing a major point please let me know.
Interface:
Every single Method declared in an Interface will have to be implemented in the subclass.
Only Events, Delegates, Properties (C#) and Methods can exist in an Interface. A class can implement multiple Interfaces.
Abstract Class:
Only Abstract methods have to be implemented by the subclass. An Abstract class can have normal methods with implementations. An Abstract class can also have class variables besides Events, Delegates, Properties and Methods. A class can implement one abstract class only due to the non-existence of Multi-inheritance in C#.
After all that, the interviewer came up with the question ""What if you had an Abstract class with only abstract methods? How would that be different from an interface?"" I didn't know the answer but I think it's the inheritance as mentioned above right?
Another interviewer asked me, ""What if you had a Public variable inside the interface, how would that be different than in a Abstract Class?"" I insisted you can't have a public variable inside an interface. I didn't know what he wanted to hear but he wasn't satisfied either.
See Also:
When to use an interface instead of an abstract class and vice versa
Interfaces vs. Abstract Classes
How do you decide between using an Abstract Class and an Interface?
What is the difference between an interface and abstract class?
"	761194	"An abstract class with only abstract methods would be different from an interface in that it still has the possibility of inheritance and can have implementations of non-abstract methods. An interface can only contain abstract members (methods, properties, etc.), while an abstract class can contain both abstract and non-abstract members.

It's not possible to have a public variable inside an interface because interfaces can only declare abstract members and do not have any implementation. The main purpose of an interface is to define a contract that must be followed by any class that implements it, without specifying how the methods are to be implemented. An abstract class, on the other hand, can provide some implementation and define a common base class for its subclasses.

The decision between using an interface or an abstract class usually depends on whether you want to define a contract or provide a common implementation. If you want to define a common behavior that must be implemented by multiple classes, you should use an interface. If you want to provide a common implementation that can be shared among subclasses, you should use an abstract class."	eu.3d5f1038-7a93-488d-9f34-54da73c5ce5b				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e1956773ecf738ef4a946d	00023de272--63dfab926adb8b18a55baada	00023de272--63e1956773ecf738ef4a946d	420edf6930f74d245330296489f788e8	APPROVED	2023-02-07T00:03:51.564	+

and plenty of URLs that I did not copy, some on SO, some on other sites, back when I thought I'd have the solution quickly.
The forever-recurring question is this: how do I solve this ""Attempted relative import in non-package"" message?
ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package
I built an exact replica of the package on pep-0328:
package/
    __init__.py
    subpackage1/
        __init__.py
        moduleX.py
        moduleY.py
    subpackage2/
        __init__.py
        moduleZ.py
    moduleA.py
The imports were done from the console.
I did make functions named spam and eggs in their appropriate modules.  Naturally, it didn't work.  The answer is apparently in the 4th URL I listed, but it's all alumni to me. There was this response on one of the URLs I visited:
Relative imports use a module's name attribute to determine that module's position in the package hierarchy. If the module's name does not contain any package information (e.g. it is set to 'main') then relative imports are resolved as if the module were a top level module, regardless of where the module is actually located on the file system.
The above response looks promising, but it's all hieroglyphs to me.  So my question, how do I make Python not return to me ""Attempted relative import in non-package""? has an answer that involves -m, supposedly.
Can somebody please tell me why Python gives that error message, what it means by ""non-package"", why and how do you define a 'package', and the precise answer put in terms easy enough for a kindergartener to understand.
"	14132789	"The ""Attempted relative import in non-package"" error message is raised in Python when you try to use a relative import statement in a script that is not part of a package. In Python, a package is a directory that contains one or more Python modules (files with .py extension) and a special file called init.py.

The init.py file tells Python that this directory should be treated as a package and makes the modules inside it accessible from other modules and scripts. If the script you are trying to import from does not belong to a package, then Python cannot determine the relative position of the modules, and the error is raised.

To avoid this error, you can either:

Make the script a part of a package by creating an init.py file in the same directory as the script, or
Use an absolute import statement instead of a relative import statement. An absolute import statement uses the full path to the module you want to import, starting from the root of your project.
For example, if you want to import the 'moduleA' from the package structure you mentioned above, you can use an absolute import statement:

python

from package.moduleA import spam
Or, if you want to use a relative import statement, you can run your script as a module by using the -m flag and specify the full package name:

java

python -m package.moduleA"	eu.6a1da2a8-c313-4ac0-9382-d5d2920c983c				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e19c2e7bd1be5801837d34	00023de272--63dfab936adb8b18a55baaff	00023de272--63e19c2e7bd1be5801837d34	c32e67a609f17871837bd42a8aa41596	APPROVED	2023-02-07T00:32:46.169	+

"How does the @property decorator work in Python?
I would like to understand how the built-in function property works. What confuses me is that property can also be used as a decorator, but it only takes arguments when used as a built-in function and not when used as a decorator.
This example is from the documentation:
class C:
    def __init__(self):
        self._x = None
    def getx(self):
        return self._x
    def setx(self, value):
        self._x = value
    def delx(self):
        del self._x
    x = property(getx, setx, delx, ""I'm the 'x' property."")
property's arguments are getx, setx, delx and a doc string.
In the code below property is used as a decorator. The object of it is the x function, but in the code above there is no place for an object function in the arguments.
class C:
    def __init__(self):
        self._x = None
    @property
    def x(self):
        """"""I'm the 'x' property.""""""

    def x(self, value):
        self._x = value

    def x(self):
        del self._x

"	17330160	The property decorator is a built-in function in Python that allows a user to define a method as a getter, setter, or deleter for a class property. When the property is defined using the property decorator, each individual accessor method (getter, setter, and deleter) can be specified using additional decorators like .getter, .setter, and .deleter, which are attached to the property object returned by property. The decorators x.setter and x.deleter are created this way, by attaching additional behavior to the property object x. The property object is returned by the property built-in function, and the decorators allow you to specify additional methods for accessing the property, such as setting or deleting it.	eu.f76c0b8f-f283-41db-b88d-904b09689fb6				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e19d318677d40ccc71ec92	00023de272--63dfab986adb8b18a55bacf0	00023de272--63e19d318677d40ccc71ec92	c32e67a609f17871837bd42a8aa41596	APPROVED	2023-02-07T00:37:05.655	+	
"Is quitting an application frowned upon?
Moving on in my attempt to learn Android, I just read the following:
  Question: Does the user have a choice to kill the application 
  unless we put a menu option in to kill it? If no such option exists, 
  how does the user terminate the application? 
  Answer: (Romain Guy): The user doesn't, the system handles this automatically. That's what the activity lifecycle (especially onPause/onStop/onDestroy) is for. No matter what you do, do not put a ""quit"" or ""exit"" application button. It is useless with Android's application model. This is also contrary to how core applications work. 
Hehe, for every step I take in the Android world I run into some sort of problem =(
Apparently, you cannot quit an application in Android (but the Android system can very well totally destroy your app whenever it feels like it). What's up with that? I am starting to think that it's impossible to write an app that functions as a ""normal app"" - that the user can quit the app when he/she decides to do so. That is not something that should be relied upon the OS to do.
The application I am trying to create is not an application for the Android Market. It is not an application for ""wide use"" by the general public, it is a business app that is going to be used in a very narrow business field.
I was actually really looking forward to developing for the Android platform, since it addresses a lot of issues that exist in Windows Mobile and .NET. However, the last week has been somewhat of a turnoff for me... I hope I don't have to abandon Android, but it doesn't look very good right now =(
Is there a way for me to really quit the application?
"	2033914	While quitting an application is not commonly done in the Android platform, it is possible to implement it by calling the finish() method on the current activity. This method terminates the activity and removes it from the activity stack, effectively quitting the application if it was the last activity. However, this approach goes against the Android design guidelines and may lead to unexpected behavior for users. It's generally recommended to let the Android system manage the lifecycle of your app, and to rely on the onPause(), onStop(), and onDestroy() methods of the activity lifecycle to handle clean-up and state management.	eu.84a432d7-a3b1-466f-8ea2-e5f05d441f1e				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e19d8b6b5f4256c3f78e78	00023de272--63dfab9a6adb8b18a55badaf	00023de272--63e19d8b6b5f4256c3f78e78	c32e67a609f17871837bd42a8aa41596	APPROVED	2023-02-07T00:38:35.930	+

"What is std::move(), and when should it be used?
What is it?
What does it do?
When should it be used?
Good links are appreciated.
"	3413470	"std::move is a C++ Standard Library function that is used to indicate that an object t should be treated as an rvalue (i.e. a value that can be moved from), even if it is an lvalue (i.e. a value that cannot be moved from). It is typically used to transfer ownership of an object to a new location without making a copy.

The function returns an rvalue reference to the argument passed to it, allowing the object to be moved to a new location without copying. This can be useful for performance optimization, especially in cases where the object being moved is large or expensive to copy.

A good use case for std::move is with the return value of a function, where the object being returned should be moved to the caller instead of copied. It can also be used in the implementation of move constructors and move assignment operators.

Here is a simple example showing how std::move can be used in a function that returns an object:

cpp

#include <utility>

class MyClass {
  public:
    MyClass() {}
    MyClass(const MyClass &) { /* copy constructor */ }
    MyClass(MyClass &&) { /* move constructor */ }
};

MyClass getObject() {
  MyClass obj;
  return std::move(obj);
}

int main() {
  MyClass obj = getObject();
  return 0;
}
In this example, the getObject function returns a temporary object that would normally be copied to the obj variable in main. However, by using std::move, the object is moved to obj instead, which is more efficient as it avoids a copy.

It's important to note that using std::move can result in undefined behavior if the moved-from object is used after it has been moved. It is also not guaranteed to be more efficient than copying, so it should be used with caution and only when necessary."	eu.e940b112-8f1e-4b5f-a535-9e55741ca714				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e1a033876ea74d13f75f8e	00023de272--63dfaba46adb8b18a55bb0c8	00023de272--63e1a033876ea74d13f75f8e	c32e67a609f17871837bd42a8aa41596	APPROVED	2023-02-07T00:49:55.827	+	
"Count the number of set bits in a 32-bit integer
8 bits representing the number 7 look like this:

Three bits are set.
What are the algorithms to determine the number of set bits in a 32-bit integer?
"	109023	"There are several algorithms to count the number of set bits (1's) in a 32-bit integer. Here are a few common ones:

Brian Kernighan's Algorithm: This algorithm works by repeatedly subtracting the least significant 1 bit of the number.
c

int countSetBits(unsigned int n) 
{ 
    int count = 0; 
    while (n) { 
        n &= (n - 1); 
        count++; 
    } 
    return count; 
}
Lookup Table: This algorithm uses a lookup table to find the number of set bits in an 8-bit number and then adds them together for the 32-bit number.
c

unsigned int lookupTable[256] = 
{ 
    0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3, 4, 
    ...
}; 
  
unsigned int countSetBits(unsigned int n) 
{ 
    return lookupTable[n & 0xff] + 
           lookupTable[(n >> 8) & 0xff] + 
           lookupTable[(n >> 16) & 0xff] + 
           lookupTable[n >> 24]; 
} 
Hamming Weight Algorithm: This algorithm uses a bit-parallel approach to find the number of set bits.
c

unsigned int countSetBits(unsigned int n) 
{ 
    n = n - ((n >> 1) & 0x55555555); 
    n = (n & 0x33333333) + ((n >> 2) & 0x33333333); 
    return (((n + (n >> 4)) & 0x0F0F0F0F) * 0x01010101) >> 24;

"SOAP vs REST (differences)
I have read articles about the differences between SOAP and REST as a web service communication protocol, but I think that the biggest advantages for REST over SOAP are: 
REST is more dynamic, no need to create and update UDDI(Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration).
REST is not restricted to only XML format. RESTful web services can send plain text/JSON/XML.
But SOAP is more standardized (E.g.: security).
So, am I correct in these points?
"	19884295	Yes, you are correct. REST is generally considered more flexible and lightweight than SOAP, as it does not enforce strict rules around message structure, making it easier to implement and less prone to errors. REST also supports multiple data formats, such as JSON and XML, whereas SOAP is typically limited to XML. On the other hand, SOAP has been around for much longer and is more heavily standardized, which can make it more secure and robust. Additionally, SOAP provides built-in support for things like error handling and message routing, which can be more difficult to implement in REST.	eu.2e5e141c-419c-4747-b489-29d6e8eb14ab				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e1a3316b5f4256c3f7cec0	00023de272--63dfab976adb8b18a55bac81	00023de272--63e1a3316b5f4256c3f7cec0	d8e61a54e640dc786924fbd68be12067	APPROVED	2023-02-07T01:02:41.066	+

"Is there a reason for C#'s reuse of the variable in a foreach?
When using lambda expressions or anonymous methods in C#, we have to be wary of the access to modified closure pitfall. For example:
foreach (var s in strings)
{
   query = query.Where(i => i.Prop == s); // access to modified closure
   ...
}
Due to the modified closure, the above code will cause all of the Where clauses on the query to be based on the final value of s.
As explained here, this happens because the s variable declared in foreach loop above is translated like this in the compiler:
string s;
while (enumerator.MoveNext())
{
   s = enumerator.Current;
   ...
}
instead of like this:
while (enumerator.MoveNext())
{
   string s;
   s = enumerator.Current;
   ...
}
As pointed out here, there are no performance advantages to declaring a variable outside the loop, and under normal circumstances the only reason I can think of for doing this is if you plan to use the variable outside the scope of the loop:
string s;
while (enumerator.MoveNext())
{
   s = enumerator.Current;
   ...
}
var finalString = s;
However variables defined in a foreach loop cannot be used outside the loop:
foreach(string s in strings)
{
}
var finalString = s; // won't work: you're outside the scope.
So the compiler declares the variable in a way that makes it highly prone to an error that is often difficult to find and debug, while producing no perceivable benefits.
Is there something you can do with foreach loops this way that you couldn't if they were compiled with an inner-scoped variable, or is this just an arbitrary choice that was made before anonymous methods and lambda expressions were available or common, and which hasn't been revised since then?
"	8898925	The reason for reusing the same variable in a foreach loop is for performance reasons. When a new variable is declared for each iteration, it increases the memory allocation and can negatively impact the performance of the program. However, this can also lead to the modified closure issue when using anonymous methods or lambda expressions. This decision was made before anonymous methods and lambda expressions were widely used and has not been revised since. To avoid the modified closure issue, one can use a temporary variable within the foreach loop.	eu.2f8b762e-21c8-4c30-a30f-e4a37b8f234c				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e1a4edfe2572323d1c1319	00023de272--63dfab876adb8b18a55ba7bd	00023de272--63e1a4edfe2572323d1c1319	d8e61a54e640dc786924fbd68be12067	APPROVED	2023-02-07T01:10:05.934	+

"	141525	"Bitwise shift operators are a type of operation that manipulates the binary representation of integers in a computer's memory. They shift the bits of an integer to the left or to the right.

The left shift operator (<<) moves the bits of a number to the left, and the right shift operator (>>) moves the bits of a number to the right. The ""unsigned right shift"" operator (>>>) is similar to the right shift operator but is used with unsigned integers.

Bit shifting can be useful in various situations, such as:

Multiplying or dividing integers by powers of two without using arithmetic operations, which can be faster.
Extracting and setting specific bits or groups of bits in a binary representation of a number.
A gotcha to keep in mind is that when you shift a number to the left, you add leading zeros, and when you shift to the right, you lose the least significant bits. Additionally, when shifting signed integers, the sign bit is preserved in C, but may change in other programming languages. With unsigned integers, the sign bit is always set to 0."	eu.b1c4c3a4-c2ce-4bff-9e7a-95fd678bef72				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e1a5c1d9b645131c33e131	00023de272--63dfab936adb8b18a55bab07	00023de272--63e1a5c1d9b645131c33e131	d8e61a54e640dc786924fbd68be12067	APPROVED	2023-02-07T01:13:37.047	+

"	15455009	"The bind() method is used to create a new function (a bound function) with the same function body (the code inside the curly braces) as the original function, but with a specific value assigned to this. The bind() method returns the bound function, which can be stored in a variable and later called.

For example, in the code you provided, the bind() method is used to create a bound function getX that always has obj as its this value, regardless of how the function is later called. The bound function is stored in a variable getXBound and is then called, resulting in an alert with the value 81.

In summary, you use bind() when you want to create a new function with a specific this value that you can call later, as opposed to immediately calling the function with a specific this value as with call() or apply().

The 'new' keyword is appropriate when you need to create multiple instances of an object with the same properties and methods. This is useful in situations where you need to create many similar objects, but each with its own unique values.

When not to use the 'new' keyword: The 'new' keyword should not be used when you only need to create a single instance of an object. In this case, it is better to use a literal object notation.

"How do I use $scope.$watch and $scope.$apply in AngularJS?
I don't understand how to use $scope.$watch and $scope.$apply. The official documentation isn't helpful.
What I don't understand specifically:
Are they connected to the DOM?
How can I update DOM changes to the model?
What is the connection point between them?
I tried this tutorial, but it takes the understanding of $watch and $apply for granted.
What do $apply and $watch do, and how do I use them appropriately?
"	15112584	"$scope.$watch and $scope.$apply are two important features in AngularJS that are used to monitor changes in the scope and update the DOM accordingly.

$scope.$watch is used to observe changes in a scope variable and take some action when the value changes. For example, you could use $scope.$watch to update the UI whenever the value of a certain variable changes. Here's an example of how to use $scope.$watch:

php
Copy code
$scope.$watch('variableName', function (newValue, oldValue) {
  // Take some action when the value changes
});
$scope.$apply is used to apply changes to the scope and trigger a digest cycle. A digest cycle is an AngularJS process that checks all the bound expressions in the scope to see if they have changed and updates the UI if necessary. If you make changes to the scope outside of AngularJS, you need to call $scope.$apply to trigger a digest cycle and update the UI. Here's an example of how to use $scope.$apply:

php
Copy code
$scope.$apply(function () {
  // Make changes to the scope
});
The connection point between $scope.$watch and $scope.$apply is that $scope.$watch is used to monitor changes in the scope and take action when the value changes, while $scope.$apply is used to apply changes to the scope and trigger a digest cycle to update the UI.

In conclusion, $scope.$watch and $scope.$apply are important features in AngularJS that are used to monitor changes in the scope and update the UI accordingly. Use $scope.$watch to observe changes in a scope variable and take some action when the value changes, and use $scope.$apply to apply changes to the scope and trigger a digest cycle to update the UI."	eu.8e58ef7c-5ede-483c-8361-d2abde441f50				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e1abf2cc2fc234c80bc67a	00023de272--63dfab9d6adb8b18a55bae6a	00023de272--63e1abf2cc2fc234c80bc67a	d8e61a54e640dc786924fbd68be12067	APPROVED	2023-02-07T01:40:02.422	+

A class that contains only static methods can be a regular class and doesn't have to be declared static.

"	18641899	"Bower and npm are both package managers for front-end and back-end JavaScript packages, respectively. However, there are some key differences:

Purpose: Bower is primarily used for front-end packages, while npm is used for back-end packages and managing dependencies for Node.js applications.

Package versioning: Bower uses a flat dependency tree, which means it does not track version numbers as strictly as npm. This can sometimes lead to version conflicts. npm uses a hierarchical dependency tree, which allows for more robust versioning.

Community: npm has a much larger community and repository of packages compared to Bower.

Configuration: npm uses a package.json file to manage dependencies and scripts, while Bower uses a bower.json file.

In general, npm has become the more popular package manager and is used more widely, while Bower is slowly being phased out.

In terms of performance, both methods are relatively efficient for small lists, but for large lists, the filter() + lambda approach may be more efficient.

"Difference between Constructor and ngOnInit
Angular provides life cycle hook ngOnInit by default.
Why should ngOnInit be used, if we already have a constructor?
"	35763730	"The constructor is a default method of a class and is used to initialize the class properties when a new instance of the class is created. It is called before any other code is executed and is used to set up the initial state of an object.

On the other hand, the ngOnInit method is an Angular lifecycle hook that is called after Angular has completed initialization of a component. It is used to perform any additional setup tasks, such as fetching data from a service, that need to be done after the component has been initialized.

The reason to use ngOnInit instead of the constructor is that Angular does some initialization work before calling the constructor, such as creating the component's view and setting its inputs. This means that in the constructor, some of the component's dependencies may not have been initialized yet, and using them in the constructor may result in errors. The ngOnInit method is called after Angular has completed all of its initialization work, so it is a safer place to perform additional setup tasks.

"Grouping functions (tapply, by, aggregate) and the *apply family
Whenever I want to do something ""map""py in R, I usually try to use a function in the apply family. 
However, I've never quite understood the differences between them -- how {sapply, lapply, etc.} apply the function to the input/grouped input, what the output will look like, or even what the input can be -- so I often just go through them all until I get what I want.
Can someone explain how to use which one when?
My current (probably incorrect/incomplete) understanding is...
sapply(vec, f): input is a vector. output is a vector/matrix, where element i is f(vec[i]), giving you a matrix if f has a multi-element output
lapply(vec, f): same as sapply, but output is a list?
apply(matrix, 1/2, f): input is a matrix. output is a vector, where element i is f(row/col i of the matrix)
tapply(vector, grouping, f): output is a matrix/array, where an element in the matrix/array is the value of f at a grouping g of the vector, and g gets pushed to the row/col names
by(dataframe, grouping, f): let g be a grouping. apply f to each column of the group/dataframe. pretty print the grouping and the value of f at each column.
aggregate(matrix, grouping, f): similar to by, but instead of pretty printing the output, aggregate sticks everything into a dataframe.
Side question: I still haven't learned plyr or reshape -- would plyr or reshape replace all of these entirely?
"	3505701	"Yes, your understanding is mostly correct, but here is a more detailed explanation:

    sapply: It applies a function to elements of a vector or a list and returns the results in a vector, matrix or an array, depending on the output of the function. The output will be a vector if the result of the function is of length 1 and a matrix/array if the result of the function is of length greater than 1.

    lapply: It is similar to sapply, but the output will always be a list, even if the result of the function is of length 1. The elements of the list will be the results of the function applied to each element of the input.

    apply: It is used to apply a function to the rows or columns of a matrix. The first argument is the matrix, the second argument is either 1 for rows or 2 for columns and the third argument is the function to be applied. The output will be a vector with the result of the function applied to each row/column.

    tapply: It applies a function to elements of a vector based on the values of a second vector (grouping vector). The output will be an array with dimensions determined by the levels of the grouping vector. Each element of the array will be the result of the function applied to the values of the original vector that belong to the same level of the grouping vector.

    by: It is used to apply a function to each column of a data frame based on the values of a factor (grouping variable). The first argument is the data frame, the second argument is the grouping variable and the third argument is the function to be applied. The output will be a list with the result of the function applied to each column of the data frame, for each level of the grouping variable.

    aggregate: It is similar to by, but the output will be a data frame with the results of the function applied to each column, for each level of the grouping variable.

Regarding your side question, plyr and reshape are packages that provide a lot of functions for data manipulation and transformation. They can provide alternatives to the functions you mentioned, but they are not designed to replace them entirely.

You can create a named tuple using the following syntax:

python

from collections import namedtuple
Point = namedtuple('Point', ['x', 'y'])
p = Point(x=11, y=22)

In terms of use, named tuples are used whenever you need to give a name to each element in a tuple, to make the code more readable. Named tuples are also used as a replacement for dictionaries, when the keys of the dictionaries are known beforehand.

When to use named tuples instead of tuples or vice versa depends on the situation. Normal tuples are faster than named tuples and can be used when you don't need named elements. Named tuples are more readable, so use them when readability is important.

"	39476	"The ""yield"" keyword in C# is used in Iterator blocks to return values one at a time.

In the code snippet you provided, the ""yield return"" statement returns the current ""item"" from the loop if it meets the condition (IsItemInPartialList(item)).

"When should you use a class vs a struct in C++?
In what scenarios is it better to use a struct vs a class in C++?
"	54585	"In C++, classes and structs have almost the same syntax and features. The only difference is the default member accessibility: members of a struct are public by default, while members of a class are private by default.

When choosing between a class and a struct, consider the following:

    If you want to model objects with a defined public interface, and where the implementation details are hidden, use a class.

    If you want to model plain data structures with no or little behavior, use a struct.

In general, if you're not sure whether to use a struct or a class, it's recommended to start with a class, and change it to a struct if the object doesn't have any behavior and is only used to hold data.

"How can I make a UITextField move up when the keyboard is present - on starting to edit?
With the iOS SDK:
I have a UIView with UITextFields that bring up a keyboard. I need it to be able to:
Allow scrolling of the contents of the UIScrollView to see the other text fields once the keyboard is brought up
Automatically ""jump"" (by scrolling up) or shortening
I know that I need a UIScrollView.  I've tried changing the class of my UIView to a UIScrollView, but I'm still unable to scroll the textboxes up or down.
Do I need both a UIView and a UIScrollView? Does one go inside the other?
What needs to be implemented in order to automatically scroll to the active text field?
Ideally as much of the setup of the components as possible will be done in Interface Builder. I'd like to only write code for what needs it.
Note: the UIView (or UIScrollView) that I'm working with is brought up by a tabbar (UITabBar), which needs to function as normal.
I am adding the scroll bar just for when the keyboard comes up.  Even though it's not needed, I feel like it provides a better interface because then the user can scroll and change textboxes, for example.
I've got it working where I change the frame size of the UIScrollView when the keyboard goes up and down. I'm simply using:
-(void)textFieldDidBeginEditing:(UITextField *)textField {
    //Keyboard becomes visible
    scrollView.frame = CGRectMake(scrollView.frame.origin.x,
                                  scrollView.frame.origin.y,
    scrollView.frame.size.width,
    scrollView.frame.size.height - 215 + 50);   // Resize
}
-(void)textFieldDidEndEditing:(UITextField *)textField {
    // Keyboard will hide
    scrollView.frame = CGRectMake(scrollView.frame.origin.x,
                                  scrollView.frame.origin.y,
                                  scrollView.frame.size.width,
                                  scrollView.frame.size.height + 215 - 50); // Resize
}
However, this doesn't automatically ""move up"" or center the lower text fields in the visible area, which is what I would really like.
"	1126726	"To make a UITextField move up when the keyboard is present, you can use the following steps:

    Create a UIScrollView to contain all your text fields.
    Set the content size of the UIScrollView to be big enough to fit all the text fields.
    Set the active text field as the first responder in the textFieldDidBeginEditing method.
    In the textFieldDidBeginEditing method, use the scrollRectToVisible method of UIScrollView to scroll to the active text field.

Here is the code for step 4:

objectivec

-(void)textFieldDidBeginEditing:(UITextField *)textField {
    [scrollView scrollRectToVisible:textField.frame animated:YES];
}

"Break a previous commit into multiple commits
Without creating a branch and doing a bunch of funky work on a new branch, is it possible to break a single commit into a few different commits after it's been committed to the local repository?
"	6217156	"Yes, it is possible to split a previous commit into multiple commits using git rebase and git reset. However, this can be a dangerous operation if the commit has already been pushed to a remote repository and others have based their work on it, as it changes the commit history and creates conflicts.

Here's how you can do it:

    Check out the branch where the commit is located.
    Use git rebase -i HEAD~<number of commits>, where <number of commits> is the number of commits you want to look back in the history.
    In the interactive rebase screen, replace the word ""pick"" with ""edit"" next to the commit you want to split.
    Save and exit the editor.
    Use git reset HEAD^ to unstage the changes.
    Use git add to stage the changes you want to keep in the first new commit.
    Use git commit to create the first new commit.
    Repeat steps 5-7 for each additional new commit you want to create.
    Use git rebase --continue to finish the rebase and apply the new commits.

public static void main(String... args) {

The Java compiler only processes the source code and comments are treated as ignored text.

"	783811	"To configure a proxy server for Git, you can set the http.proxy or https.proxy properties in your Git configuration file (~/.gitconfig or .git/config in your repo).

For example, if you are using an HTTP proxy server located at http://proxy.example.com:8080, you can run the following command:

javascript
Copy code
git config --global http.proxy http://proxy.example.com:8080
For HTTPS, you can run:

javascript
Copy code
git config --global https.proxy https://proxy.example.com:8080
If you need to enter a username and password to access the proxy, you can specify it in the URL:

javascript
Copy code
git config --global http.proxy http://user:password@proxy.example.com:8080
You can also specify proxy settings for a specific Git repository by using the --local option instead of --global.

If you are still encountering ""Request timed out"" error, check if the proxy is working correctly, try a different proxy or check if the Git server is accessible from your network."	eu.7b3de01e-2ce4-4743-b878-e5714faef70d				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e1ce8989576016d8ee8e72	00023de272--63dfaba36adb8b18a55bb063	00023de272--63e1ce8989576016d8ee8e72	420edf6930f74d245330296489f788e8	APPROVED	2023-02-07T04:07:37.371	+

HashMap uses a hash table for storage and does not maintain the order of its elements. It offers fast performance for basic operations (get and put), but elements are not guaranteed to be ordered in any particular way.

LinkedHashMap extends HashMap and maintains the order of elements in the order they were inserted. It also provides the same basic operations as HashMap with a slight overhead due to its doubly-linked list that maintains the order.

TreeMap is a Red-Black tree-based implementation of the SortedMap interface, providing guaranteed log(n) time cost for basic operations. Elements are stored in sorted order, either natural or by a custom comparator.

Hashtable is a synchronized implementation of the Map interface in Java, meaning it provides thread safety. It's older than HashMap and less frequently used because of its synchronization overhead.

"With arrays, why is it the case that a[5] == 5[a]?
As Joel points out in Stack Overflow podcast #34, in C Programming Language (aka: K & R), there is mention of this property of arrays in C: a[5] == 5[a]
Joel says that it's because of pointer arithmetic but I still don't understand. Why does a[5] == 5[a]?
"	381542	In C programming language, arrays are implemented as pointers to the first element of the array, so that a[i] is equivalent to *(a + i). In this context, a[5] and 5[a] are equivalent because the expression 5[a] is interpreted as *(5 + a), which is the same as *(a + 5), which is the same as a[5]. Pointer arithmetic is used to calculate the address of the i-th element in the array, and it works regardless of the direction of the indexing, so a[5] == 5[a].	eu.c5c872df-9914-4f3d-94fc-6ebb9fe32059				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e1d2f755593637d4bbd5d2	00023de272--63dfab8c6adb8b18a55ba8d5	00023de272--63e1d2f755593637d4bbd5d2	420edf6930f74d245330296489f788e8	APPROVED	2023-02-07T04:26:31.886	+	
"How can one change the timestamp of an old commit in Git?
The answers to How to modify existing, unpushed commits? describe a way to amend previous commit messages that haven't yet been pushed upstream.  The new messages inherit the timestamps of the original commits.  This seems logical, but is there a way to also re-set the times?
"	454734	"It is not possible to directly change the timestamp of a Git commit after it has been created. The SHA-1 hash of the commit, which is what is used to identify it in the Git repository, is dependent on its entire contents, including the timestamp. Changing the timestamp would result in a new commit with a different hash, and this new commit would not be connected to the old commit in any way.

However, you can create a new commit with the desired timestamp by ""cherry-picking"" the changes from the old commit and applying them to a new commit. The new commit will have the desired timestamp, but it will be a separate commit in the Git history, rather than a modification of the old commit."	eu.d490be1a-a0ec-4c6d-a3da-787e015a3147				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e1d33389576016d8eef76f	00023de272--63dfaba26adb8b18a55bb04a	00023de272--63e1d33389576016d8eef76f	420edf6930f74d245330296489f788e8	APPROVED	2023-02-07T04:27:31.242	+

"Calling the base constructor in C#

"What is event bubbling and capturing?
What is the difference between event bubbling and capturing? When should one use bubbling vs capturing?
"	4616694	"Event bubbling and capturing are two techniques in DOM (Document Object Model) event handling for propagating events from the target element (the element that triggered the event) to the parent elements in the DOM hierarchy.

Event bubbling: The event propagates from the target element to the parent elements, starting from the innermost element. Event handlers are called in the same order as the bubbling process.

Event capturing: The event propagates from the parent elements to the target element, starting from the outermost element. Event handlers are called in the reverse order compared to bubbling.

The difference between event bubbling and capturing is the order in which event handlers are called, and the direction of event propagation.

When to use event bubbling: It is typically used when you want to handle an event on a parent element that is common to several child elements, rather than handling it on each child element individually.

When to use event capturing: It is used less frequently than bubbling and typically when you want to handle an event on an outermost element, before it reaches the target element.

It's important to note that modern browsers mostly use event bubbling and event capturing is not widely used."	eu.64cc6ae7-e5af-4f06-926c-b290cbd5e3dd				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e1d905bbed6c706eba8ce1	00023de272--63dfab9b6adb8b18a55badf3	00023de272--63e1d905bbed6c706eba8ce1	420edf6930f74d245330296489f788e8	APPROVED	2023-02-07T04:52:21.038	+	
"What is the difference between varchar and nvarchar?
Is it just that nvarchar supports multibyte characters? If that is the case, is there really any point, other than storage concerns, to using varchars?
"	144283	"Yes, that's correct. The main difference between varchar and nvarchar is that varchar is a character data type that stores characters as single-byte or multi-byte characters, whereas nvarchar is a character data type that stores characters as Unicode characters.

As a result, nvarchar can store characters from a wider range of character sets, including non-Latin characters, and it takes up twice the storage space of varchar.

So, the point of using varchar instead of nvarchar is mainly storage optimization. If you only need to store characters from a single-byte character set, such as Latin, then varchar will use less storage space. However, if you need to store characters from a wider range of character sets, or if you want to ensure that your data can be used in different locales without corruption, then nvarchar is the better choice.

"Creating a singleton in Python
This question is not for the discussion of whether or not the singleton design pattern is desirable, is an anti-pattern, or for any religious wars, but to discuss how this pattern is best implemented in Python in such a way that is most pythonic. In this instance I define 'most pythonic' to mean that it follows the 'principle of least astonishment'.
I have multiple classes which would become singletons (my use-case is for a logger, but this is not important). I do not wish to clutter several classes with added gumph when I can simply inherit or decorate.
Best methods:
Method 1: A decorator
def singleton(class_):
    instances = {}
    def getinstance(*args, **kwargs):
        if class_ not in instances:
            instances[class_] = class_(*args, **kwargs)
        return instances[class_]
    return getinstance
@singleton
class MyClass(BaseClass):
    pass
Pros
Decorators are additive in a way that is often more intuitive than multiple inheritance.
Cons
While objects created using MyClass() would be true singleton objects, MyClass itself is a function, not a class, so you cannot call class methods from it. Also for
x = MyClass();
y = MyClass();
t = type(n)();
then x == y but x != t && y != t
Method 2: A base class
class Singleton(object):
    _instance = None
    def __new__(class_, *args, **kwargs):
        if not isinstance(class_._instance, class_):
            class_._instance = object.__new__(class_, *args, **kwargs)
        return class_._instance
class MyClass(Singleton, BaseClass):
    pass
Pros
It's a true class
Cons
Multiple inheritance - eugh! __new__ could be overwritten during inheritance from a second base class? One has to think more than is necessary.
Method 3: A metaclass
class Singleton(type):
    _instances = {}
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            cls._instances[cls] = super(Singleton, cls).__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        return cls._instances[cls]
#Python2
class MyClass(BaseClass):
    __metaclass__ = Singleton
#Python3
class MyClass(BaseClass, metaclass=Singleton):
    pass
Pros
It's a true class
Auto-magically covers inheritance
Uses __metaclass__ for its proper purpose (and made me aware of it)
Cons
Are there any?
Method 4: decorator returning a class with the same name
def singleton(class_):
    class class_w(class_):
        _instance = None
        def __new__(class_, *args, **kwargs):

                                                    *args,

                class_w._instance._sealed = False
            return class_w._instance
        def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
            if self._sealed:

Is there not an overhead for creating each new class? Here we are creating two classes for each class we wish to make a singleton. While this is fine in my case, I worry that this might not scale. Of course there is a matter of debate as to whether it aught to be too easy to scale this pattern...
What is the point of the _sealed attribute
Can't call methods of the same name on base classes using super() because they will recurse. This means you can't customize __new__ and can't subclass a class that needs you to call up to __init__.
Method 5: a module
a module file singleton.py
Pros
Simple is better than complex
Cons
Not lazily instantiated
"	6760685	"All the methods discussed have their pros and cons, but method 3 using a metaclass is often considered to be the most Pythonic way of implementing the singleton pattern. This method automatically covers inheritance, uses metaclasses for its proper purpose, and provides a true class. The only con with this method is that it may not be familiar to some developers.

Method 4 with a decorator returning a class with the same name can also be a good option. It provides a true class, automatically covers inheritance, and has a relatively simple implementation. However, it creates two classes for each singleton class and has limitations in customizing new and subclassing classes.

The other methods such as using a decorator or a base class have limitations or complexities in their implementation, making them less desirable. However, they can still be used depending on the specific requirements of the project."	eu.37326fd1-aac6-41e0-8609-ad9c94f96588				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e1da35f7d97f7044a121e9	00023de272--63dfab926adb8b18a55baadf	00023de272--63e1da35f7d97f7044a121e9	420edf6930f74d245330296489f788e8	APPROVED	2023-02-07T04:57:25.453	+

"What's the difference between event.stopPropagation and event.preventDefault?
They seem to be doing the same thing...
Is one modern and one old? Or are they supported by different browsers?
When I handle events myself (without framework) I just always check for both and execute both if present. (I also return false, but I have the feeling that doesn't work with events attached with node.addEventListener).
  So why both? Should I keep checking for both? Or is there actually a difference?
(I know, a lot of questions, but they're all sort of the same =))
"	5963669	"event.stopPropagation and event.preventDefault are both methods used to handle events in JavaScript, but they have different purposes:

event.preventDefault() is used to prevent the default behavior of an event. For example, if you have a form and you don't want it to submit when the submit button is clicked, you can call preventDefault() on the submit event to prevent the form from being submitted.

event.stopPropagation() is used to stop the event from propagating (or ""bubbling"") up the DOM tree. In other words, it stops the event from triggering any parent elements.

Both methods are widely supported by modern browsers and are still used in modern web development. In practice, it's good to check for both methods if you're handling events manually, but you should use them according to the specific needs of your use case. If you just want to prevent the default behavior of an event, preventDefault() is sufficient. If you also want to stop the event from propagating up the DOM tree, you can call stopPropagation() in addition to preventDefault().

Regarding return false: This is an old way of handling events, and it's not recommended for use with modern event handling techniques, such as addEventListener. The preferred method is to use preventDefault() and/or stopPropagation() directly on the event object."	eu.8537f526-2e84-470f-acd5-23ee23a6cc15				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e1dac289576016d8ef7d71	00023de272--63dfab9f6adb8b18a55baf41	00023de272--63e1dac289576016d8ef7d71	420edf6930f74d245330296489f788e8	APPROVED	2023-02-07T04:59:46.504	+

"Git workflow and rebase vs merge questions
I've been using Git now for a couple of months on a project with one other developer. I have several years of experience with SVN, so I guess I bring a lot of baggage to the relationship.
I have heard that Git is excellent for branching and merging, and so far, I just don't see it. Sure, branching is dead simple, but when I try to merge, everything goes all to hell. Now, I'm used to that from SVN, but it seems to me that I just traded one sub-par versioning system for another.
My partner tells me that my problems stem from my desire to merge willy-nilly, and that I should be using rebase instead of merge in many situations. For example, here's the workflow that he's laid down:
clone the remote repository
git checkout -b my_new_feature
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..finish the feature
git checkout master
git merge my_new_feature
Essentially, create a feature branch, ALWAYS rebase from master to the branch, and merge from the branch back to master. Important to note is that the branch always stays local.
Here is the workflow that I started with
clone remote repository
create my_new_feature branch on remote repository
git checkout -b --track my_new_feature origin/my_new_feature
..work, commit, push to origin/my_new_feature
git merge master (to get some changes that my partner added)
..work, commit, push to origin/my_new_feature
git merge master
..finish my_new_feature, push to origin/my_new_feature
git checkout master
git merge my_new_feature
delete remote branch
delete local branch
There are two essential differences (I think): I use merge always instead of rebasing, and I push my feature branch (and my feature branch commits) to the remote repository.
My reasoning for the remote branch is that I want my work backed up as I'm working. Our repository is automatically backed up and can be restored if something goes wrong. My laptop is not, or not as thoroughly. Therefore, I hate to have code on my laptop that's not mirrored somewhere else.
My reasoning for the merge instead of rebase is that merge seems to be standard and rebase seems to be an advanced feature. My gut feeling is that what I'm trying to do is not an advanced setup, so rebase should be unnecessary. I've even perused the new Pragmatic Programming book on Git, and they cover merge extensively and barely mention rebase.
Anyway, I was following my workflow on a recent branch, and when I tried to merge it back to master, it all went to hell. There were tons of conflicts with things that should have not mattered. The conflicts just made no sense to me. It took me a day to sort everything out, and eventually culminated in a forced push to the remote master, since my local master has all conflicts resolved, but the remote one still wasn't happy.
What is the ""correct"" workflow for something like this? Git is supposed to make branching and merging super-easy, and I'm just not seeing it.
Update 2011-04-15
This seems to be a very popular question, so I thought I'd update with my two years experience since I first asked.
It turns out that the original workflow is correct, at least in our case. In other words, this is what we do and it works:
clone the remote repository
git checkout -b my_new_feature
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..finish the feature, commit
git rebase master
git checkout master
git merge my_new_feature
In fact, our workflow is a little different, as we tend to do squash merges instead of raw merges. (Note: This is controversial, see below.) This allows us to turn our entire feature branch into a single commit on master. Then we delete our feature branch. This allows us to logically structure our commits on master, even if they're a little messy on our branches. So, this is what we do:
clone the remote repository
git checkout -b my_new_feature
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..finish the feature, commit
git rebase master
git checkout master
git merge --squash my_new_feature
git commit -m ""added my_new_feature""
git branch -D my_new_feature
Squash Merge Controversy - As several commenters have pointed out, the squash merge will throw away all history on your feature branch. As the name implies, it squashes all the commits down into a single one. For small features, this makes sense as it condenses it down into a single package. For larger features, it's probably not a great idea, especially if your individual commits are already atomic. It really comes down to personal preference.
Github and Bitbucket (others?) Pull Requests - In case you're wondering how merge/rebase relates to Pull Requests, I recommend following all the above steps up until you're ready to merge back to master. Instead of manually merging with git, you just accept the PR. Note that this will not do a squash merge (at least not by default), but non-squash, non-fast-forward is the accepted merge convention in the Pull Request community (as far as I know). Specifically, it works like this:
clone the remote repository
git checkout -b my_new_feature
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..finish the feature, commit
git rebase master
git push # May need to force push
...submit PR, wait for a review, make any changes requested for the PR
git rebase master
git push # Will probably need to force push (-f), due to previous rebases from master
...accept the PR, most likely also deleting the feature branch in the process
git checkout master
git branch -d my_new_feature
git remote prune origin
I've come to love Git and never want to go back to SVN. If you're struggling, just stick with it and eventually you'll see the light at the end of the tunnel.
"	457927	"The ""correct"" Git workflow depends on the specific needs and preferences of the team or individual using it. However, in general, the recommended workflow for using Git with a team is to create a feature branch for each new feature, rebase the feature branch from the main branch (usually ""master"") to incorporate the latest changes, and then merge the feature branch back into the main branch once the feature is complete. Some teams prefer to use squash merges to keep a clean commit history on the main branch, while others prefer to keep a full commit history of the feature branch. The choice between merge and rebase comes down to personal preference and the specific use case, with rebase being better suited for fast-moving branches, while merge is better for preserving the history of a branch. Pushing a feature branch to the remote repository is a good way to backup work in progress, but it's also possible to work locally and push only when the feature is complete."	eu.8477ad6f-4c68-4e63-91a1-a3816b4d7e20				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e1db42faab2d703d816bf9	00023de272--63dfaba26adb8b18a55bb000	00023de272--63e1db42faab2d703d816bf9	420edf6930f74d245330296489f788e8	APPROVED	2023-02-07T05:01:54.047	+

"What is the difference between MVC and MVVM?
Is there a difference between the standard ""Model View Controller"" pattern and Microsoft's Model/View/ViewModel pattern?
"	667781	"Yes, there is a difference between the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern and the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern.

MVC is a design pattern that separates the application into three main components: the model (data), the view (user interface), and the controller (controls the interaction between model and view).

MVVM, on the other hand, is a variation of the MVC pattern that was specifically created for use with Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and Silverlight, and it was introduced by Microsoft. It follows the same basic principles as MVC, but it introduces the concept of a ViewModel. The ViewModel acts as a bridge between the Model and the View, handling all data-related logic that the View needs. The View is only responsible for displaying the data and sending user actions to the ViewModel.

In essence, the difference between MVC and MVVM is that MVVM has a ViewModel that acts as a mediator between the Model and View, whereas in MVC the Controller performs this role."	eu.22c5e4b2-1998-40cd-af61-b672a856f454				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e1ddabf24cb959b93af050	00023de272--63dfab946adb8b18a55babb2	00023de272--63e1ddabf24cb959b93af050	420edf6930f74d245330296489f788e8	APPROVED	2023-02-07T05:12:11.297	+

"How can I selectively merge or pick changes from another branch in Git?
I'm using Git on a new project that has two parallel -- but currently experimental -- development branches:
master: import of existing codebase plus a few modifications that I'm generally sure of
exp1: experimental branch #1
exp2: experimental branch #2
exp1 and exp2 represent two very different architectural approaches. Until I get further along I have no way of knowing which one (if either) will work. As I make progress in one branch I sometimes have edits that would be useful in the other branch and would like to merge just those.
What is the best way to merge selective changes from one development branch to another while leaving behind everything else?
Approaches I've considered:
git merge --no-commit followed by manual unstaging of a large number of edits that I don't want to make common between the branches.
Manual copying of common files into a temporary directory followed by git checkout to move to the other branch and then more manual copying out of the temporary directory into the working tree.
A variation on the above. Abandon the exp branches for now and use two additional local repositories for experimentation.  This makes the manual copying of files much more straightforward.
All three of these approaches seem tedious and error-prone.  I'm hoping there is a better approach; something akin to a filter path parameter that would make git-merge more selective.
"	449541	"The best approach to selectively merge changes from one branch to another in Git is using the git cherry-pick command.

Here is an example:

Check out the branch where you want to apply the changes: git checkout <target_branch>
Run the git cherry-pick command and specify the commit hash: git cherry-pick <commit_hash>
This will apply the changes from the specified commit to the current branch. Repeat the process for each additional change you want to apply.

Note: The cherry-pick approach only works for changes that are committed in individual commits. If you want to merge a whole branch, using git merge with the --no-commit option followed by manually unstaging changes might be a better approach."	eu.adf79b34-c351-4a9e-b140-064b57c63b85				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e1dfc5f24cb959b93b17f1	00023de272--63dfab8d6adb8b18a55ba947	00023de272--63e1dfc5f24cb959b93b17f1	420edf6930f74d245330296489f788e8	APPROVED	2023-02-07T05:21:09.646	+

It is generally recommended to use properties instead of fields when external code needs to access the data stored in the class, as properties provide a level of abstraction and encapsulation that fields do not.

"HTTP response code for POST when resource already exists
I'm building a server that allows clients to store objects.  Those objects are fully constructed at client side, complete with object IDs that are permanent for the whole lifetime of the object.
I have defined the API so that clients can create or modify objects using PUT:
PUT /objects/{id} HTTP/1.1

The {id} is the object ID, so it is part of the Request-URI.
Now, I'm also considering allowing clients to create the object using POST:
POST /objects/ HTTP/1.1

"Table Naming Dilemma: Singular vs. Plural Names
Academia has it that table names should be the singular of the entity that they store attributes of.  
I dislike any T-SQL that requires square brackets around names, but I have renamed a Users table to the singular, forever sentencing those using the table to sometimes have to use brackets.  
My gut feel is that it is more correct to stay with the singular, but my gut feel is also that brackets indicate undesirables like column names with spaces in them etc.
Should I stay, or should I go?
"	338156	There is no one-size-fits-all answer to the singular vs plural naming dilemma for tables. It is largely a matter of personal preference and your team's naming conventions. However, it is generally recommended to use singular names for tables as it reflects the fact that a table represents a single instance of an entity. Also, using singular names can make it easier to write meaningful SQL statements and avoid ambiguity. On the other hand, using square brackets to escape table names with spaces or special characters is considered a best practice to ensure compatibility with different database systems and to avoid syntax errors.	eu.eed3114d-a19a-4059-a621-bc654b04a5d0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e1e4c46ee87c7e28e592d4	00023de272--63dfab8d6adb8b18a55ba927	00023de272--63e1e4c46ee87c7e28e592d4	286ce83192d264c83604997426952e82	APPROVED	2023-02-07T05:42:28.626	+

In this case, you may need to modify your sys.path to include the parent package, or use an absolute import with the full package name to import the desired module.	eu.f8ca80c1-a2ca-4089-b157-17697d014799				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e1e5208677d40ccc767411	00023de272--63dfab936adb8b18a55bab44	00023de272--63e1e5208677d40ccc767411	286ce83192d264c83604997426952e82	APPROVED	2023-02-07T05:44:00.832	+

How do I put it under nohup (that is, how do I cause it to continue running even if I close the terminal?)
"	625409	"You can use the ""nohup"" command and the ""disown"" command to put an already-running process under ""nohup"". Here's how you can do it:

Run the following command, replacing ""PID"" with the actual PID of the process:
bash
Copy code
nohup bash -c ""kill -STOP PID; exec sh"" &
disown
This puts the process under ""nohup"" and detaches it from the terminal, so it will continue running even if you close the terminal.

Note: The ""kill -STOP"" command is used to prevent the process from receiving a ""SIGHUP"" signal when the terminal is closed. This is necessary because the default behavior of ""nohup"" is to ignore the ""SIGHUP"" signal, but the process may still receive it if it is not detached from the terminal."	eu.d1201c1e-29cc-4a5a-be20-5eebd5abb63a				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e1e5c6a483b40389632d43	00023de272--63dfaba06adb8b18a55baf83	00023de272--63e1e5c6a483b40389632d43	286ce83192d264c83604997426952e82	APPROVED	2023-02-07T05:46:46.793	+

"When to use virtual destructors?
I have a solid understanding of most OOP theory but the one thing that confuses me a lot is virtual destructors.
I thought that the destructor always gets called no matter what and for every object in the chain.
When are you meant to make them virtual and why?
"	461203	"You use virtual destructors when you have a base class with a virtual function and a derived class, and you want the destructor of the derived class to be called when an object of the derived class is deleted through a pointer to the base class.

Without a virtual destructor, the base class destructor would be called, leading to incorrect behavior or memory leaks if the derived class has dynamically allocated memory. Declaring the destructor of the base class as virtual ensures that the correct derived class destructor is called, even if the object is deleted through a pointer to the base class."	eu.1e92ebee-555b-4898-991c-6f8bd7210f40				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e20130acc4494d7c716ed4	00023de272--63dfab8b6adb8b18a55ba85c	00023de272--63e20130acc4494d7c716ed4	286ce83192d264c83604997426952e82	APPROVED	2023-02-07T07:43:44.042	+	
"Access-Control-Allow-Origin Multiple Origin Domains?
Is there a way to allow multiple cross-domains using the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header?
I'm aware of the *, but it is too open. I really want to allow just a couple domains.
As an example, something like this:
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://domain1.example, http://domain2.example
I have tried the above code but it does not seem to work in Firefox.
Is it possible to specify multiple domains or am I stuck with just one?
"	1653308	"Yes, it is possible to specify multiple domains for the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header. You can set the header to a comma-separated list of allowed domains.

However, in practice, most browsers only support one value for this header, meaning you will have to choose one domain to allow or use the wildcard * to allow all domains.

For example:

bash
Copy code
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://domain1.example, http://domain2.example
This will not work in most browsers, as they only support a single value for the header. The recommended way to handle this is to check the Origin header in your server-side code, and set the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header accordingly.

For example, in a PHP script:

bash
Copy code
header(""Access-Control-Allow-Origin: "".$_SERVER['HTTP_ORIGIN']);
This will allow the request to be accepted only if the Origin header in the request matches one of the allowed domains."	eu.4eb5e38e-f4e9-4e91-b066-1bec4e477edf				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e20195a7805b45cda53d6e	00023de272--63dfab976adb8b18a55bacb8	00023de272--63e20195a7805b45cda53d6e	286ce83192d264c83604997426952e82	APPROVED	2023-02-07T07:45:25.442	+

"Differences between dependencyManagement and dependencies in Maven
What is the difference between dependencyManagement and dependencies?
I have seen the docs at Apache Maven web site.
It seems that a dependency defined under the dependencyManagement can be used in its child modules without specifying the version.
For example:
A parent project (Pro-par) defines a dependency under the dependencyManagement:
<dependencyManagement>
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>junit</groupId>
      <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
      <version>3.8</version>
    </dependency>
 </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
Then in the child of Pro-par, I can use the junit:
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>junit</groupId>
    <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
However, I wonder if it is necessary to define junit in the parent pom? Why not define it directly in the needed module?
"	2619598	"The dependencyManagement section in Maven serves as a centralized place to manage the version numbers of dependencies used across multiple modules within a project. It defines the versions of the dependencies that the child modules should use. When a child module includes a dependency without specifying its version, it will inherit the version number from the dependencyManagement section of its parent pom.

Defining dependencies directly in the child module is possible, but it becomes difficult to manage and update the version numbers across multiple modules if the same dependencies are used in many modules. The dependencyManagement section makes it easy to manage the version numbers in a centralized place and ensures consistency across the modules."	eu.e15953a5-6f90-402d-bb55-12bee50f4927				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e202c771475a6ccd99abda	00023de272--63dfaba26adb8b18a55bb031	00023de272--63e202c771475a6ccd99abda	286ce83192d264c83604997426952e82	APPROVED	2023-02-07T07:50:31.292	+

"What is a lambda expression in C++11?
What is a lambda expression in C++11? When would I use one? What class of problem do they solve that wasn't possible prior to their introduction?
A few examples, and use cases would be useful. 
"	7627098	"A lambda expression in C++11 is a small anonymous function that can be used to pass functionality as an argument to algorithms or as a callable object. They were introduced in C++11 to provide a more concise and readable syntax for writing small, inline functions that can be used as arguments to higher-order functions or as callable objects.

Lambdas capture variables from their surrounding scope and can be used to write functions that operate on those variables, making them useful for writing small, one-off functions that can be passed to algorithms or used as callable objects.

Examples of using lambdas:

Sorting a vector of integers in ascending order:
cpp
Copy code
vector<int> v = {5, 2, 7, 3};
sort(v.begin(), v.end(), [](int a, int b) {
    return a < b;

Filtering a list of strings based on a condition:
vbnet
Copy code
list<string> lst = {""apple"", ""banana"", ""cherry""};
list<string> result;
for_each(lst.begin(), lst.end(), [&result](const string& s) {
    if (s.length() > 5) {
        result.push_back(s);
    }
});
Lambdas were not possible prior to C++11 and their introduction made it easier to write code that was more concise and readable, especially when dealing with functional programming concepts."	eu.ca379b2d-5837-4dc0-9e34-d6e8e15924a5				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e20b2230c50f2112ca2084	00023de272--63dfab8d6adb8b18a55ba92c	00023de272--63e20b2230c50f2112ca2084	51c1a4b90d1121c9e2b052896226136d	APPROVED	2023-02-07T08:26:10.254	+	
"Font scaling based on size of container
I'm having a hard time getting my head around font scaling.
I currently have a website with a body font-size of 100%. 100% of what though? This seems to compute out at 16 pixels.
I was under the impression that 100% would somehow refer to the size of the browser window, but apparently not because it's always 16 pixels whether the window is resized down to a mobile width or full-blown widescreen desktop.
How can I make the text on my site scale in relation to its container? I tried using em, but this doesn't scale either.
My reasoning is that things like my menu become squished when you resize, so I need to reduce the px font-size of .menuItem among other elements in relation to the width of the container. (For example, in the menu on a large desktop, 22px works perfectly. Move down to tablet width and 16px is more appropriate.)
I'm aware I can add breakpoints, but I really want the text to scale as well as having extra breakpoints, otherwise, I'll end up with hundreds of breakpoints for every 100pixels decrease in width to control the text.

"DateTime vs DateTimeOffset
What is the difference between a DateTime and a DateTimeOffset and when should one be used?
Currently, we have a standard way of dealing with .NET DateTimes in a TimeZone-aware way: Whenever we produce a DateTime we do it in UTC (e.g. using DateTime.UtcNow), and whenever we display one, we convert back from UTC to the user's local time.
That works fine, but I've been reading about DateTimeOffset and how it captures the local and UTC time in the object itself.
"	4331189	"DateTime represents a date and time value without any time zone information. It is typically used when the specific time zone is either not important or is already known and can be adjusted for as needed.

DateTimeOffset, on the other hand, includes the UTC offset information along with the date and time value, allowing for easy conversion to other time zones or for use in systems that require time zone information.

One should use DateTime if the specific time zone is either not important or already known and can be adjusted for. Use DateTimeOffset if time zone information is important and needs to be preserved during operations or storage.

In short, DateTime is better for internal and non-interchangeable representation of time while DateTimeOffset is better for use in systems that require time zone information, such as interchanging data between different time zones or for time zone-aware display purposes."	eu.b4461ee9-7551-4cd4-9a28-59c838b49de0				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e20bb134f46a1d1ad40f02	00023de272--63dfaba36adb8b18a55bb067	00023de272--63e20bb134f46a1d1ad40f02	286ce83192d264c83604997426952e82	APPROVED	2023-02-07T08:28:33.902	+

"Secure hash and salt for PHP passwords
It is currently said that MD5 is partially unsafe. Taking this into consideration, I'd like to know which mechanism to use for password protection.
This question, Is “double hashing” a password less secure than just hashing it once? 
suggests that hashing multiple times may be a good idea, whereas How to implement password protection for individual files? suggests using salt.
I'm using PHP. I want a safe and fast password encryption system. Hashing a password a million times may be safer, but also slower. How to achieve a good balance between speed and safety? Also, I'd prefer the result to have a constant number of characters.
The hashing mechanism must be available in PHP
It must be safe
It can use salt (in this case, are all salts equally good? Is there any way to generate good salts?)
Also, should I store two fields in the database (one using MD5 and another one using SHA, for example)? Would it make it safer or unsafer?
In case I wasn't clear enough, I want to know which hashing function(s) to use and how to pick a good salt in order to have a safe and fast password protection mechanism.
Related questions that don't quite cover my question:

"	401656	"For password protection, it's recommended to use a strong and modern cryptographic hash function such as bcrypt, scrypt or Argon2, as they are designed specifically for password storage and are much more secure than MD5 or SHA.

As for the salt, it's important to use a unique and random salt for each user, to protect against pre-computed rainbow table attacks. The salt should be at least 16 bytes long, generated using a secure random number generator.

Regarding the number of characters, most of these hash functions will produce a variable length output, however, you can use a constant-length encoding such as base64 to make it more manageable.

Regarding storing multiple fields, it's not necessary, as using a single field with a modern and secure hash function is sufficient for password protection.

To summarize, use bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2 for password hashing, and generate a unique random salt of at least 16 bytes for each user."	eu.e80a5577-bd3b-47a4-b1c8-bfccd9f8b1ff				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e21feebe1c1b1869208aad	00023de272--63dfab9a6adb8b18a55bada2	00023de272--63e21feebe1c1b1869208aad	286ce83192d264c83604997426952e82	APPROVED	2023-02-07T09:54:54.372	+

"How should I ethically approach user password storage for later plaintext retrieval?
As I continue to build more and more websites and web applications I am often asked to store user's passwords in a way that they can be retrieved if/when the user has an issue (either to email a forgotten password link, walk them through over the phone, etc.)  When I can I fight bitterly against this practice and I do a lot of ‘extra’ programming to make password resets and administrative assistance possible without storing their actual password.
When I can’t fight it (or can’t win) then I always encode the password in some way so that it, at least, isn’t stored as plaintext in the database—though I am aware that if my DB gets hacked it wouldn't take much for the culprit to crack the passwords, so that makes me uncomfortable.
In a perfect world folks would update passwords frequently and not duplicate them across many different sites—unfortunately I know MANY people that have the same work/home/email/bank password, and have even freely given it to me when they need assistance.  I don’t want to be the one responsible for their financial demise if my DB security procedures fail for some reason.
Morally and ethically I feel responsible for protecting what can be, for some users, their livelihood even if they are treating it with much less respect.
I am certain that there are many avenues to approach and arguments to be made for salting hashes and different encoding options, but is there a single ‘best practice’ when you have to store them?  In almost all cases I am using PHP and MySQL if that makes any difference in the way I should handle the specifics.
Additional Information for Bounty
I want to clarify that I know this is not something you want to have to do and that in most cases refusal to do so is best.  I am, however, not looking for a lecture on the merits of taking this approach I am looking for the best steps to take if you do take this approach.
In a note below I made the point that websites geared largely toward the elderly, mentally challenged, or very young can become confusing for people when they are asked to perform a secure password recovery routine.  Though we may find it simple and mundane in those cases some users need the extra assistance of either having a service tech help them into the system or having it emailed/displayed directly to them.  
In such systems the attrition rate from these demographics could hobble the application if users were not given this level of access assistance, so please answer with such a setup in mind.
Thanks to Everyone
This has been a fun question with lots of debate and I have enjoyed it.  In the end I selected an answer that both retains password security (I will not have to keep plain text or recoverable passwords), but also makes it possible for the user base I specified to log into a system without the major drawbacks I have found from normal password recovery.
As always there were about 5 answers that I would like to have marked as correct for different reasons, but I had to choose the best one--all the rest got a +1.  Thanks everyone!
Also, thanks to everyone in the Stack community who voted for this question and/or marked it as a favorite.  I take hitting 100 up votes as a compliment and hope that this discussion has helped someone else with the same concern that I had.

A mixin is essentially a way to reuse code and behavior without having to create a full-fledged class hierarchy. The idea is that a mixin can be used in conjunction with other classes to provide additional behavior or attributes.

In contrast to multiple inheritance, where a class can inherit from multiple parent classes, mixins are designed to be combined with other classes, rather than being used on their own. This allows the mixin to provide a specific set of behavior or attributes that can be used in multiple contexts.

Mixins can be seen as an alternative to composition, where a class composes or aggregates objects of other classes to provide a desired behavior or attribute. However, mixins provide a cleaner way of adding behavior, since they don't require creating instances of other classes.

So, to summarize, the main difference between mixins and multiple inheritance is that mixins are designed to provide specific reusable behavior, while multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from multiple classes in a more general sense."	eu.ac666101-ed51-4fff-ab0a-7ac5fb07fb2c				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e241a7be1c1b186925e7fa	00023de272--63dfab986adb8b18a55bad12	00023de272--63e241a7be1c1b186925e7fa	d8e61a54e640dc786924fbd68be12067	APPROVED	2023-02-07T12:18:47.601	+

Also, check the spelling and capitalization of the filenames in the .gitignore file, as Git is case-sensitive.

If the issue persists, try creating a new .gitignore file or moving the current .gitignore file to a different directory and see if that fixes the problem. If it does, it's possible that the .gitignore file may have been corrupted, so you may need to create a new one.

"Create Generic method constraining T to an Enum
I'm building a function to extend the Enum.Parse concept that
Allows a default value to be parsed in case that an Enum value is not found
Is case insensitive
So I wrote the following:
public static T GetEnumFromString<T>(string value, T defaultValue) where T : Enum
{
    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(value)) return defaultValue;
    foreach (T item in Enum.GetValues(typeof(T)))
    {
        if (item.ToString().ToLower().Equals(value.Trim().ToLower())) return item;
    }
    return defaultValue;
}
I am getting a Error Constraint cannot be special class System.Enum.
Fair enough, but is there a workaround to allow a Generic Enum, or am I going to have to mimic the Parse function and pass a type as an attribute, which forces the ugly boxing requirement to your code.
EDIT All suggestions below have been greatly appreciated, thanks.
Have settled on (I've left the loop to maintain case insensitivity - I am using this when parsing XML)
public static class EnumUtils
{
    public static T ParseEnum<T>(string value, T defaultValue) where T : struct, IConvertible
    {
        if (!typeof(T).IsEnum) throw new ArgumentException(""T must be an enumerated type"");

I want to read ASCII data from a file. What are the possible ways and their differences?
"	4716503	"In Java, you can read plain text data from a file using the following methods:

FileReader and BufferedReader classes: This method reads text data one character at a time using the FileReader class, and then buffers the data for efficient reading using the BufferedReader class.
InputStreamReader and BufferedReader classes: This method reads binary data from an InputStream and converts it to characters using the InputStreamReader class, and then buffers the data for efficient reading using the BufferedReader class.
Scanner class: This is a convenient method for reading data from various sources including files, input streams, and strings. The Scanner class provides methods for parsing various data types such as integers, doubles, and strings.
In general, the choice between these methods depends on the requirements of your application and the specific use case. For instance, if you want to read data character by character, the FileReader and BufferedReader combination would be the best option.

If getters and setters are ever doing more than just the simple get/set, I can figure this one out very quickly, but I'm not 100% clear on how:

is any worse than:
private String foo;
public void setFoo(String foo) { this.foo = foo; }

"	1568091	"Getters and setters (also known as accessors) allow you to control and manipulate the data stored in your object's properties. By using getters and setters, you can encapsulate your data and protect it from external modifications, making it easier to maintain and manage your code. Additionally, getters and setters provide a convenient way to perform additional operations or calculations when getting or setting a property's value, such as validation or formatting.

In comparison, using public fields is less secure and can lead to unintended consequences if the data is directly modified from outside the object. By using getters and setters, you can ensure that data is consistently accessed and manipulated in a controlled and predictable manner.

While using getters and setters does add more boilerplate code, it provides a more structured and maintainable way to manage your data, which can be especially useful in larger and more complex applications."	eu.e6fc44cb-c461-46ff-9d01-1371217a5b95				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e24ed863631c5823d9729a	00023de272--63dfab8b6adb8b18a55ba84c	00023de272--63e24ed863631c5823d9729a	286ce83192d264c83604997426952e82	APPROVED	2023-02-07T13:15:04.866	+

For what purpose is this function useful? If I wanted to find a value associated with a key in a dictionary, I can just do dict[key], and it returns the same thing:
dictionary = {""Name"": ""Harry"", ""Age"": 17}

print(dictionary.get(""Gender"", ""Not found""))
This will output ""Not found"" because the ""Gender"" key is not in the dictionary. On the other hand, dictionary[""Gender""] would raise a KeyError.

Another advantage of using dict.get() is that it can make your code more readable, especially when you want to provide a default value for missing keys.

So, you can use either dict[key] or dict.get(key) to retrieve values from a dictionary, but it's recommended to use dict.get(key) because it's more flexible and safer."	eu.5c4d5d3e-cef5-4bac-8389-a5f2564cb33e				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e24f4a24a853625ee29752	00023de272--63dfaba26adb8b18a55bb044	00023de272--63e24f4a24a853625ee29752	286ce83192d264c83604997426952e82	APPROVED	2023-02-07T13:16:58.742	+

"Can't bind to 'formGroup' since it isn't a known property of 'form'
The situation
I am trying to make what should be a very simple form in my Angular application, but no matter what, it never works.
The Angular version

"Get property value from string using reflection
I am trying implement the Data transformation using Reflection1 example in my code.
The GetSourceValue function has a switch comparing various types, but I want to remove these types and properties and have GetSourceValue get the value of the property using only a single string as the parameter.  I want to pass a class and property in the string and resolve the value of the property.
Is this possible?
1 Web Archive version of original blog post
"	1196991	"Yes, it is possible to get the property value from a string using reflection in C#. You can use the Type class to get the type of an object, and then use the GetProperty method to get the property from the type. Once you have the property, you can use the GetValue method to get the value of the property. Here's an example:

python
Copy code
public object GetSourceValue(object source, string propertyName)
{
    Type type = source.GetType();
    PropertyInfo property = type.GetProperty(propertyName);
    return property.GetValue(source);
}
In this example, the source parameter is the object that contains the property, and the propertyName parameter is the string that represents the name of the property. The GetSourceValue method returns the value of the property."	eu.61e147f7-6339-442b-92e9-052bf12e5815				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e25456a7805b45cdb20806	00023de272--63dfab9c6adb8b18a55bae1b	00023de272--63e25456a7805b45cdb20806	d8e61a54e640dc786924fbd68be12067	APPROVED	2023-02-07T13:38:30.254	+	
"Why do I need to do `--set-upstream` all the time?
I create a new branch in Git:
git branch my_branch
Push it:
git push origin my_branch
Now say someone made some changes on the server and I want to pull from origin/my_branch. I do:
git pull
But I get:
You asked me to pull without telling me which branch you
want to merge with, and 'branch.my_branch.merge' in
your configuration file does not tell me, either. Please
specify which branch you want to use on the command line and
try again (e.g. 'git pull <repository> <refspec>').
See git-pull(1) for details.
If you often merge with the same branch, you may want to
use something like the following in your configuration file:
    [branch ""my_branch""]
    remote = <nickname>
    merge = <remote-ref>
    [remote ""<nickname>""]
    url = <url>
    fetch = <refspec>
See git-config(1) for details.
I learned that I can make it work with:
git branch --set-upstream my_branch origin/my_branch
But why do I need to do this for every branch I create? Isn't it obvious that if I push my_branch into origin/my_branch, then I would want to pull origin/my_branch into my_branch? How can I make this the default behavior?
"	6089294	"By default, Git doesn't set up tracking between a local branch and a remote branch. The --set-upstream option sets up the upstream branch for the local branch, so that Git knows which branch to merge or pull when you run git pull.

To make it the default behavior, you can set the push.default configuration value to tracking. This will set the upstream branch automatically when you run git push on a new branch. You can set this configuration globally by running:

    out: An out parameter does not need to be initialized before it is passed to the method. The method is responsible for initializing the out parameter before returning.

In summary, if you need to pass an argument to a method and you need to ensure that it has been initialized beforehand, use ref.

"Where can I find php.ini?
A few years ago I installed Apache 2.2x and PHP 5.3.1 on a Linux server I maintain.  I used .tar.gz's and built them as instructed (instead of rpms and what-have-you). And all was fine.
Today I need to install this which seems like a PHP library.  I went through all the steps up to make install, and I found ibm_db2.so in $PHP_HOME/lib/extensions/somecomplicatedname/ibm_db2.so.
The great catch is the last step is to configure file php.ini, but there aren't any php.ini files on my system. Horror of horrors. PHP works fine, except of course for this newfangled ibm_db2 thingamajig that I want to use so somebody can use a GUI to tinker with DB2. (I tried a small PHP script which fails and indicates that the ibm_db2 functions are not available.)
I have to deal with PHP once every few years, so please enlighten me at a very basic level about what I could do to enable web-based GUI access to DB2.
"	8684609	"To locate the php.ini file on your Linux server, you can try running the following command in the terminal:

ruby

$ locate php.ini

This should give you a list of all php.ini files present on your system. If you don't have the locate command installed, you can use the find command instead:

javascript

$ find / -name php.ini 2>/dev/null

If you don't find a php.ini file, you can create one by copying the sample php.ini file from the PHP installation directory to the directory where your PHP configuration files are stored. On most systems, this directory is /etc/php5/cli or /etc/php5/apache2.

Once you have the php.ini file, you can enable the IBM DB2 extension by adding the following line to the file:

makefile

extension=ibm_db2.so

Restart your Apache server after making changes to the php.ini file to apply the changes. You should now be able to use the IBM DB2 library in your PHP scripts.

"Meaning of @classmethod and @staticmethod for beginner
What do @classmethod and @staticmethod mean in Python, and how are they different? When should I use them, why should I use them, and how should I use them?
As far as I understand, @classmethod tells a class that it's a method which should be inherited into subclasses, or... something. However, what's the point of that? Why not just define the class method without adding @classmethod or @staticmethod or any @ definitions?
"	12179271	"@classmethod and @staticmethod are decorators in Python that are used to define methods that belong to a class rather than an instance of the class.

    @classmethod takes a class as its first argument, rather than an instance, and is used for methods that operate on the class itself rather than on instances of the class. This is useful for methods that need to access or modify class-level state, such as class variables.

    @staticmethod is used for methods that do not access the class or instance in any way, but operate solely on the arguments passed to them. They do not have access to the class or instance, and can be thought of as functions that are scoped to the class namespace.

In general, you should use @classmethod when you need to access or modify class-level state, and @staticmethod when you have a method that is logically connected to a class but does not access the class or instance in any way.

Here is a simple example to demonstrate the usage of @classmethod and @staticmethod:

python

class Rectangle:
    count = 0

    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height
        Rectangle.count += 1

    def __repr__(self):
        return f""Rectangle(width={self.width}, height={self.height})""

    @classmethod
    def square(cls, side_length):
        return cls(side_length, side_length)

    @staticmethod
    def is_valid_dimensions(width, height):
        return all(isinstance(d, int) and d > 0 for d in (width, height))"	eu.a457eabf-6570-409d-a664-5ad6c4443037				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e266d7acc4494d7c811302	00023de272--63dfab866adb8b18a55ba760	00023de272--63e266d7acc4494d7c811302	d8e61a54e640dc786924fbd68be12067	APPROVED	2023-02-07T14:57:27.777	+

What is the difference between concurrency and parallelism?
"	1050222	"Concurrency and parallelism are related but distinct concepts in computing.

Concurrency refers to the ability of a system to execute multiple tasks simultaneously, where each task appears to run independently and in parallel, but in reality they are executed by sharing the same CPU time. This is accomplished by quickly switching between tasks, giving the illusion of parallel execution.

Parallelism, on the other hand, refers to the actual simultaneous execution of multiple tasks, where each task is executed on a separate CPU core. This results in true parallel execution, with each task making progress at the same time.

In other words, concurrency is about dealing with a lot of things at once, parallelism is about doing a lot of things at once."	eu.220ade4c-8464-45db-b3bb-68cb56e317e2				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e2675b0e2f6d5b97d0aa79	00023de272--63dfab946adb8b18a55bab52	00023de272--63e2675b0e2f6d5b97d0aa79	d8e61a54e640dc786924fbd68be12067	APPROVED	2023-02-07T14:59:39.457	+

"Use of *args and **kwargs
So I have difficulty with the concept of *args and **kwargs.

I think to enter lists and dictionaries as arguments of a function AND at the same time as a wildcard, so I can pass ANY argument?

Are *args and **kwargs just placeholders or do you use exactly *args and **kwargs in the code?
"	3394835	"Yes, you are correct. *args and **kwargs are used to pass a list of arguments and a dictionary of keyword arguments, respectively, to a function. The asterisks in front of args and kwargs are what allow the function to receive an arbitrary number of arguments and keyword arguments.

python
Copy code
def greet(*names, **attributes):
  for name in names:
    print(f""Hello, {name}!"")
  for key, value in attributes.items():

# Output:
# Hello, John!
# Hello, Jane!
# Hello, Jim!
# age: 32
# location: New York
In the example, the function greet takes an arbitrary number of positional arguments, which are collected in the names list, and an arbitrary number of keyword arguments, which are collected in the attributes dictionary. The function then prints a greeting for each name and the key-value pairs in the attributes dictionary.

Regarding your question about the names *args and **kwargs, these are just convention.

Can you please describe what the TypeScript language is?
What can it do that JavaScript or available libraries cannot do, that would give me reason to consider it?
"	12694530	"TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript, meaning it adds features to the language that JavaScript does not have natively. It was developed by Microsoft and is now an open-source project.

The main benefits of using TypeScript over JavaScript include:

Type annotations: TypeScript allows you to add type annotations to your variables, functions, and parameters, making it easier to catch type-related errors during development.

Interfaces: Interfaces allow you to define a set of properties and methods that an object should have, making it easier to enforce consistent structures across your codebase.

Classes: TypeScript provides a way to write object-oriented code using classes, which can be especially helpful for larger, more complex applications.

Better tooling: TypeScript is designed to work with modern development tools, such as IDEs and text editors, which can provide better code completion, error checking, and other features.

Improved readability: TypeScript can make your code more readable and easier to understand, especially for other developers who may be working on the same codebase.

These benefits can lead to increased productivity, better code quality, and reduced development time."	eu.15fc97af-bde0-403f-91ac-88dd1b574afd				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e279f29ed0f818537788d4	00023de272--63dfab806adb8b18a55ba6a3	00023de272--63e279f29ed0f818537788d4	51c1a4b90d1121c9e2b052896226136d	APPROVED	2023-02-07T16:18:58.175	+

"Why does comparing strings using either '==' or 'is' sometimes produce a different result?
Two string variables are set to the same value. s1 == s2 always returns True, but s1 is s2 sometimes returns False.
If I open my Python interpreter and do the same is comparison, it succeeds:
>>> s1 = 'text'
>>> s2 = 'text'

Why is this?
"	1504717	"The reason is that Python uses a optimization technique called interning for string literals, which means that two string literals with the same value are stored in the same memory location. This is why s1 is s2 returns True in the example above.

However, this interning optimization is only applied to string literals, not to string objects created dynamically with string operations or through user input. When you create two separate string objects with the same value, they are stored in different memory locations, even though they have the same value. In this case, s1 is s2 would return False.

The == operator compares the values of two objects, while the is operator compares the identity of two objects. So, even though s1 and s2 have the same value, they are not the same object in memory, so s1 is s2 returns False. But, because their values are equal, s1 == s2 returns True."	eu.f1e23436-4567-4033-a3d3-31ea47d2f813				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e27b0830c50f2112db91cd	00023de272--63dfab986adb8b18a55bacdb	00023de272--63e27b0830c50f2112db91cd	51c1a4b90d1121c9e2b052896226136d	APPROVED	2023-02-07T16:23:36.638	+

Update the HTML code that references the favicon to use the new file name.

Restart the tomcat server to ensure it serves the updated favicon.

Regarding how favicons work, they are typically stored in the root directory of a website and referenced in the HTML code with a link tag in the header section. The browser caches the favicon so that it doesn't have to request it every time the user visits the site. This makes the site load faster but can sometimes result in an outdated favicon if it is not refreshed.

"Best way to use Google's hosted jQuery, but fall back to my hosted library on Google fail
What would be a good way to attempt to load the hosted jQuery at Google (or other Google hosted libs), but load my copy of jQuery if the Google attempt fails?
I'm not saying Google is flaky. There are cases where the Google copy is blocked (apparently in Iran, for instance).
Would I set up a timer and check for the jQuery object?
What would be the danger of both copies coming through?
Not really looking for answers like ""just use the Google one"" or ""just use your own."" I understand those arguments. I also understand that the user is likely to have the Google version cached. I'm thinking about fallbacks for the cloud in general.
Edit: This part added...
Since Google suggests using google.load to load the ajax libraries, and it performs a callback when done, I'm wondering if that's the key to serializing this problem.
I know it sounds a bit crazy. I'm just trying to figure out if it can be done in a reliable way or not.
Update: jQuery now hosted on Microsoft's CDN.
http://www.asp.net/ajax/cdn/
"	1014203	"You can use the following code to load the jQuery library from Google's CDN with a fallback to your own hosted version:

<script>
if (!window.jQuery) {
  document.write('<script src=""path/to/your/jquery.js""><\/script>');
}
</script>

In general, lambdas are not a necessary feature in Python, and in many cases, a named function is a clearer and more maintainable option.

"What is JavaScript's highest integer value that a number can go to without losing precision?
Is this defined by the language? Is there a defined maximum? Is it different in different browsers?
"	307179	The highest integer value that a JavaScript number can represent without losing precision is approximately 1.79E+308. This is defined by the IEEE 754 standard for floating-point arithmetic, which JavaScript follows. However, it's important to note that JavaScript uses a 64-bit floating-point format, which can lead to loss of precision for very large or very small numbers. The maximum value is not defined by the language itself but by the underlying hardware and the IEEE standard. The behavior should be consistent across all modern browsers, as they all implement JavaScript according to the same standard.	eu.a0b164fa-0fcf-4892-b479-915b179f7182				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e28f9724a853625ee94368	00023de272--63dfab9f6adb8b18a55baf37	00023de272--63e28f9724a853625ee94368	420edf6930f74d245330296489f788e8	APPROVED	2023-02-07T17:51:19.949	+	
"How to cherry-pick multiple commits
I have two branches. Commit a is the head of one, while the other has b, c, d, e and f on top of a. I want to move c, d, e and f to first branch without commit b. Using cherry pick it is easy: checkout first branch cherry-pick one by one c to f and rebase second branch onto first. But is there any way to cherry-pick all c-f in one command?
Here is a visual description of the scenario (thanks JJD):
"	1670970	"Yes, you can cherry-pick multiple commits in one command by specifying the range of commit hashes to be cherry-picked. For example, if the commit hashes of c, d, e, and f are abc123, def456, ghi789, and jkl012, respectively, you can use the following command:

ruby
Copy code
$ git checkout first-branch
$ git cherry-pick abc123^..jkl012
The ^ symbol specifies the parent commit of the current commit, and .. specifies a range of commits. In this case, the range abc123^..jkl012 specifies all the commits from the parent of c (abc123) to f (jkl012), inclusive."	eu.960ae6f3-cae6-4d2d-948e-d659b1d1da64				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e28fcb63631c5823e3fddc	00023de272--63dfab956adb8b18a55bac23	00023de272--63e28fcb63631c5823e3fddc	286ce83192d264c83604997426952e82	APPROVED	2023-02-07T17:52:11.653	+

In your case, since there were no changes on the dev branch after you created the myfeature branch from it, Git fast-forwarded the myfeature branch to the dev branch.

If you want to create a new branch that is not fast-forwarded, you need to make sure there are changes on the base branch after you create the new branch. For example, you could create a new commit on the dev branch and then create the myfeature branch:

php
Copy code
# switch to the dev branch
git checkout dev
# make a new commit on the dev branch
git commit --allow-empty -m ""empty commit""
# create the myfeature branch
git checkout -b myfeature

"No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource—when trying to get data from a REST API
I'm trying to fetch some data from the REST API of HP Alm. It works pretty well with a small curl script—I get my data.
Now doing that with JavaScript, fetch and ES6 (more or less) seems to be a bigger issue. I keep getting this error message:
Fetch API cannot load . Response to preflight request doesn't
pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is
present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://127.0.0.1:3000' is
therefore not allowed access. The response had HTTP status code 501.
If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to
'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.
I understand that this is because I am trying to fetch that data from within my localhost and the solution should be using Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). I thought I actually did that, but somehow it either ignores what I write in the header or the problem is something else.
So, is there an implementation issue? Am I doing it wrong? I can't check the server logs unfortunately. I'm really a bit stuck here.
function performSignIn() {
  let headers = new Headers();
  headers.append('Content-Type', 'application/json');
  headers.append('Accept', 'application/json');
  headers.append('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', 'http://localhost:3000');
  headers.append('Access-Control-Allow-Credentials', 'true');
  headers.append('GET', 'POST', 'OPTIONS');
  headers.append('Authorization', 'Basic ' + base64.encode(username + "":"" + password));
  fetch(sign_in, {
      //mode: 'no-cors',
      credentials: 'include',
      method: 'POST',
      headers: headers
    })
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(json => console.log(json))
    .catch(error => console.log('Authorization failed : ' + error.message));
}
I am using Chrome. I also tried using that Chrome CORS Plugin, but then I am getting another error message:
The value of the 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header in the response
must not be the wildcard '*' when the request's credentials mode is
'include'. Origin 'http://127.0.0.1:3000' is therefore not allowed
access. The credentials mode of requests initiated by the
XMLHttpRequest is controlled by the withCredentials attribute.
"	43871637	"The issue is that the server you are trying to fetch data from is not sending an ""Access-Control-Allow-Origin"" header in its response, indicating that it is not allowing cross-origin requests from your domain. The ""Access-Control-Allow-Origin"" header is required for CORS to work, and it specifies which domains are allowed to make requests to the API.

You can try setting the ""Access-Control-Allow-Origin"" header to ""*"" to allow requests from any domain, but this is not recommended as it could open up security vulnerabilities. It's better to specify the exact domains that are allowed to make requests to the API.

Another option is to use a proxy server to fetch the data from the API. This way, the proxy server would make the request to the API, and your JavaScript code would make a request to the proxy server. The proxy server would then send the response back to your code, so the ""Access-Control-Allow-Origin"" header would not be an issue.

You can also use the ""mode: 'no-cors'"" option in the fetch call, but this would disable CORS and the response would not include any of the required headers or cookies, so it's not recommended for most use cases."	eu.df7003a8-330e-4d12-b03f-2208836186e9				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/37610098/00023de272--63e290c2b212636f8f9ca800	00023de272--63dfab9e6adb8b18a55baee8	00023de272--63e290c2b212636f8f9ca800	420edf6930f74d245330296489f788e8	APPROVED	2023-02-07T17:56:18.516	+
