10168686	"Image Processing: Algorithm Improvement for 'Coca-Cola Can' Recognition

One of the most interesting projects I've worked on in the past couple of years was a project about image processing. The goal was to develop a system to be able to recognize Coca-Cola 'cans' (note that I'm stressing the word 'cans', you'll see why in a minute). You can see a sample below, with the can recognized in the green rectangle with scale and rotation.



Some constraints on the project:


The background could be very noisy.
The can could have any scale or rotation or even orientation (within reasonable limits).
The image could have some degree of fuzziness (contours might not be entirely straight).
There could be Coca-Cola bottles in the image, and the algorithm should only detect the can!
The brightness of the image could vary a lot (so you can't rely ""too much"" on color detection).
The can could be partly hidden on the sides or the middle and possibly partly hidden behind a bottle.
There could be no can at all in the image, in which case you had to find nothing and write a message saying so.


So you could end up with tricky things like this (which in this case had my algorithm totally fail):



I did this project a while ago, and had a lot of fun doing it, and I had a decent implementation. Here are some details about my implementation:

Language: Done in C++ using OpenCV library.

Pre-processing: For the image pre-processing, i.e. transforming the image into a more raw form to give to the algorithm, I used 2 methods:


Changing color domain from RGB to HSV and filtering based on ""red"" hue, saturation above a certain threshold to avoid orange-like colors, and filtering of low value to avoid dark tones. The end result was a binary black and white image, where all white pixels would represent the pixels that match this threshold. Obviously there is still a lot of crap in the image, but this reduces the number of dimensions you have to work with.
  
Noise filtering using median filtering (taking the median pixel value of all neighbors and replace the pixel by this value) to reduce noise.
Using Canny Edge Detection Filter to get the contours of all items after 2 precedent steps.



Algorithm: The algorithm itself I chose for this task was taken from this awesome book on feature extraction and called Generalized Hough Transform (pretty different from the regular Hough Transform). It basically says a few things:


You can describe an object in space without knowing its analytical equation (which is the case here).
It is resistant to image deformations such as scaling and rotation, as it will basically test your image for every combination of scale factor and rotation factor.
It uses a base model (a template) that the algorithm will ""learn"".
Each pixel remaining in the contour image will vote for another pixel which will supposedly be the center (in terms of gravity) of your object, based on what it learned from the model.


In the end, you end up with a heat map of the votes, for example here all the pixels of the contour of the can will vote for its gravitational center, so you'll have a lot of votes in the same pixel corresponding to the center, and will see a peak in the heat map as below:



Once you have that, a simple threshold-based heuristic can give you the location of the center pixel, from which you can derive the scale and rotation and then plot your little rectangle around it (final scale and rotation factor will obviously be relative to your original template). In theory at least...

Results: Now, while this approach worked in the basic cases, it was severely lacking in some areas:


It is extremely slow! I'm not stressing this enough. Almost a full day was needed to process the 30 test images, obviously because I had a very high scaling factor for rotation and translation, since some of the cans were very small.
It was completely lost when bottles were in the image, and for some reason almost always found the bottle instead of the can (perhaps because bottles were bigger, thus had more pixels, thus more votes)
Fuzzy images were also no good, since the votes ended up in pixel at random locations around the center, thus ending with a very noisy heat map.
In-variance in translation and rotation was achieved, but not in orientation, meaning that a can that was not directly facing the camera objective wasn't recognized.


Can you help me improve my specific algorithm, using exclusively OpenCV features, to resolve the four specific issues mentioned?

I hope some people will also learn something out of it as well, after all I think not only people who ask questions should learn. :)

3331353	"Transitions on the CSS display property

I'm currently designing a CSS 'mega dropdown' menu - basically a regular CSS-only dropdown menu, but one that contains different types of content.

At the moment, it appears that CSS 3 transitions don't apply to the 'display' property, i.e., you can't do any sort of transition from display: none to display: block (or any combination).

Is there a way for the second-tier menu from the above example to 'fade in' when someone hovers over one of the top level menu items?

I'm aware that you can use transitions on the visibility: property, but I can't think of a way to use that effectively.

I've also tried using height, but that just failed miserably.

I'm also aware that it's trivial to achieve this using JavaScript, but I wanted to challenge myself to use just CSS, and I think I'm coming up a little short.

10660435	"How do I split the definition of a long string over multiple lines?

I have a very long query. I would like to split it in several lines in Python. A way to do it in JavaScript would be using several sentences and joining them with a + operator (I know, maybe it's not the most efficient way to do it, but I'm not really concerned about performance in this stage, just code readability). Example:
var long_string = 'some text not important. just garbage to' +
                      'illustrate my example';

I tried doing something similar in Python, but it didn't work, so I used \ to split the long string. However, I'm not sure if this is the only/best/pythonicest way of doing it. It looks awkward.

"
8898925	"Is there a reason for C#'s reuse of the variable in a foreach?

When using lambda expressions or anonymous methods in C#, we have to be wary of the access to modified closure pitfall. For example:

foreach (var s in strings)
{
   query = query.Where(i => i.Prop == s); // access to modified closure
   ...
}


Due to the modified closure, the above code will cause all of the Where clauses on the query to be based on the final value of s.

As explained here, this happens because the s variable declared in foreach loop above is translated like this in the compiler:

string s;
while (enumerator.MoveNext())
{
   s = enumerator.Current;
   ...
}


instead of like this:

while (enumerator.MoveNext())
{
   string s;
   s = enumerator.Current;
   ...
}


As pointed out here, there are no performance advantages to declaring a variable outside the loop, and under normal circumstances the only reason I can think of for doing this is if you plan to use the variable outside the scope of the loop:

string s;
while (enumerator.MoveNext())
{
   s = enumerator.Current;
   ...
}
var finalString = s;


However variables defined in a foreach loop cannot be used outside the loop:

foreach(string s in strings)
{
}
var finalString = s; // won't work: you're outside the scope.


So the compiler declares the variable in a way that makes it highly prone to an error that is often difficult to find and debug, while producing no perceivable benefits.

Is there something you can do with foreach loops this way that you couldn't if they were compiled with an inner-scoped variable, or is this just an arbitrary choice that was made before anonymous methods and lambda expressions were available or common, and which hasn't been revised since then?

With the iOS SDK:
I have a UIView with UITextFields that bring up a keyboard. I need it to be able to:

Allow scrolling of the contents of the UIScrollView to see the other text fields once the keyboard is brought up

Automatically ""jump"" (by scrolling up) or shortening


I know that I need a UIScrollView.  I've tried changing the class of my UIView to a UIScrollView, but I'm still unable to scroll the textboxes up or down.
Do I need both a UIView and a UIScrollView? Does one go inside the other?
What needs to be implemented in order to automatically scroll to the active text field?
Ideally as much of the setup of the components as possible will be done in Interface Builder. I'd like to only write code for what needs it.
Note: the UIView (or UIScrollView) that I'm working with is brought up by a tabbar (UITabBar), which needs to function as normal.

I am adding the scroll bar just for when the keyboard comes up.  Even though it's not needed, I feel like it provides a better interface because then the user can scroll and change textboxes, for example.
I've got it working where I change the frame size of the UIScrollView when the keyboard goes up and down. I'm simply using:
-(void)textFieldDidBeginEditing:(UITextField *)textField {
    //Keyboard becomes visible
    scrollView.frame = CGRectMake(scrollView.frame.origin.x,
                                  scrollView.frame.origin.y,
    scrollView.frame.size.width,
    scrollView.frame.size.height - 215 + 50);   // Resize
}

-(void)textFieldDidEndEditing:(UITextField *)textField {
    // Keyboard will hide
    scrollView.frame = CGRectMake(scrollView.frame.origin.x,
                                  scrollView.frame.origin.y,
                                  scrollView.frame.size.width,
                                  scrollView.frame.size.height + 215 - 50); // Resize
}

However, this doesn't automatically ""move up"" or center the lower text fields in the visible area, which is what I would really like.

I'm using Git on a new project that has two parallel -- but currently experimental -- development branches:

exp2: experimental branch #2

exp1 and exp2 represent two very different architectural approaches. Until I get further along I have no way of knowing which one (if either) will work. As I make progress in one branch I sometimes have edits that would be useful in the other branch and would like to merge just those.
What is the best way to merge selective changes from one development branch to another while leaving behind everything else?
Approaches I've considered:

git merge --no-commit followed by manual unstaging of a large number of edits that I don't want to make common between the branches.

Manual copying of common files into a temporary directory followed by git checkout to move to the other branch and then more manual copying out of the temporary directory into the working tree.

A variation on the above. Abandon the exp branches for now and use two additional local repositories for experimentation.  This makes the manual copying of files much more straightforward.


All three of these approaches seem tedious and error-prone.  I'm hoping there is a better approach; something akin to a filter path parameter that would make git-merge more selective.

What's the proper way to declare custom exception classes in modern Python? My primary goal is to follow whatever standard other exception classes have, so that (for instance) any extra string I include in the exception is printed out by whatever tool caught the exception.
By ""modern Python"" I mean something that will run in Python 2.5 but be 'correct' for the Python 2.6 and Python 3.* way of doing things. And by ""custom"" I mean an Exception object that can include extra data about the cause of the error: a string, maybe also some other arbitrary object relevant to the exception.

In my example, I need to vertically center the <img> in the <div> with class =""frame"":
<div class=""frame"" style=""height: 25px;"">
    <img src=""http://jsfiddle.net/img/logo.png"" />
</div>

.frame's height is fixed and the image's height is unknown. I can add new elements in .frame if that's the only solution. I'm trying to do this on Internet  Explorer 7  and later, WebKit, Gecko.
See the jsfiddle here.


.frame {
    height: 25px;      /* Equals maximum image height */
    line-height: 25px;
    width: 160px;
    border: 1px solid red;

    text-align: center;
    margin: 1em 0;
}
img {
    background: #3A6F9A;
    vertical-align: middle;
    max-height: 25px;
    max-width: 160px;
}
<div class=frame>
   <img src=""http://jsfiddle.net/img/logo.png"" height=250 />
</div>

21692193	"Why not inherit from List<T>?

When planning out my programs, I often start with a chain of thought like so:


  A football team is just a list of football players. Therefore, I should represent it with:

var football_team = new List<FootballPlayer>();

  
  The ordering of this list represent the order in which the players are listed in the roster.


But I realize later that teams also have other properties, besides the mere list of players, that must be recorded. For example, the running total of scores this season, the current budget, the uniform colors, a string representing the name of the team, etc..

So then I think:


  Okay, a football team is just like a list of players, but additionally, it has a name (a string) and a running total of scores (an int). .NET does not provide a class for storing football teams, so I will make my own class. The most similar and relevant existing structure is List<FootballPlayer>, so I will inherit from it:

class FootballTeam : List<FootballPlayer> 
{ 
    public string TeamName; 
    public int RunningTotal 
}



But it turns out that a guideline says you shouldn't inherit from List<T>. I'm thoroughly confused by this guideline in two respects.

Why not?

Apparently List is somehow optimized for performance. How so? What performance problems will I cause if I extend List? What exactly will break?

Another reason I've seen is that List is provided by Microsoft, and I have no control over it, so I cannot change it later, after exposing a ""public API"". But I struggle to understand this. What is a public API and why should I care? If my current project does not and is not likely to ever have this public API, can I safely ignore this guideline? If I do inherit from List and it turns out I need a public API, what difficulties will I have?

Why does it even matter? A list is a list. What could possibly change? What could I possibly want to change?

And lastly, if Microsoft did not want me to inherit from List, why didn't they make the class sealed?

What else am I supposed to use?

Apparently, for custom collections, Microsoft has provided a Collection class which should be extended instead of List. But this class is very bare, and does not have many useful things, such as AddRange, for instance. jvitor83's answer provides a performance rationale for that particular method, but how is a slow AddRange not better than no AddRange?

Inheriting from Collection is way more work than inheriting from List, and I see no benefit. Surely Microsoft wouldn't tell me to do extra work for no reason, so I can't help feeling like I am somehow misunderstanding something, and inheriting Collection is actually not the right solution for my problem.

I've seen suggestions such as implementing IList. Just no. This is dozens of lines of boilerplate code which gains me nothing.

Lastly, some suggest wrapping the List in something: 

class FootballTeam 
{ 
    public List<FootballPlayer> Players; 
}


There are two problems with this:


It makes my code needlessly verbose. I must now call my_team.Players.Count instead of just my_team.Count. Thankfully, with C# I can define indexers to make indexing transparent, and forward all the methods of the internal List... But that's a lot of code! What do I get for all that work?
It just plain doesn't make any sense. A football team doesn't ""have"" a list of players. It is the list of players. You don't say ""John McFootballer has joined SomeTeam's players"". You say ""John has joined SomeTeam"". You don't add a letter to ""a string's characters"", you add a letter to a string. You don't add a book to a library's books, you add a book to a library.


I realize that what happens ""under the hood"" can be said to be ""adding X to Y's internal list"", but this seems like a very counter-intuitive way of thinking about the world.

My question (summarized)

What is the correct C# way of representing a data structure, which, ""logically"" (that is to say, ""to the human mind"") is just a list of things with a few bells and whistles?

Is inheriting from List<T> always unacceptable? When is it acceptable? Why/why not? What must a programmer consider, when deciding whether to inherit from List<T> or not?

The thing is that I don't get what is exactly happening here.

                        (note the space in front of the '!').  {cmd} is
                        executed like with "":!{cmd}"", any '!' is replaced with
                        the previous command |:!|.


so it passes all the lines as standard input.

The !sudo tee part calls tee with administrator privileges.

16056591	"Font scaling based on size of container

I'm having a hard time getting my head around font scaling.

I currently have a website with a body font-size of 100%. 100% of what though? This seems to compute out at 16 pixels.

I was under the impression that 100% would somehow refer to the size of the browser window, but apparently not because it's always 16 pixels whether the window is resized down to a mobile width or full-blown widescreen desktop.

How can I make the text on my site scale in relation to its container? I tried using em, but this doesn't scale either.

My reasoning is that things like my menu become squished when you resize, so I need to reduce the px font-size of .menuItem among other elements in relation to the width of the container. (For example, in the menu on a large desktop, 22px works perfectly. Move down to tablet width and 16px is more appropriate.)

I'm aware I can add breakpoints, but I really want the text to scale as well as having extra breakpoints, otherwise, I'll end up with hundreds of breakpoints for every 100pixels decrease in width to control the text.

I wrote some code for testing the impact of try-catch, but seeing some surprising results.

static void Main(string[] args)

    Process.GetCurrentProcess().PriorityClass = ProcessPriorityClass.RealTime;

    long start = 0, stop = 0, elapsed = 0;
    double avg = 0.0;

    long temp = Fibo(1);

    for (int i = 1; i < 100000000; i++)
    {
        start = Stopwatch.GetTimestamp();
        temp = Fibo(100);
        stop = Stopwatch.GetTimestamp();

        elapsed = stop - start;
        avg = avg + ((double)elapsed - avg) / i;
    }

    Console.WriteLine(""Elapsed: "" + avg);
    Console.ReadKey();
}

static long Fibo(int n)
{
    long n1 = 0, n2 = 1, fibo = 0;
    n++;

    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)
    {
        n1 = n2;
        n2 = fibo;
        fibo = n1 + n2;
    }

    return fibo;
}


On my computer, this consistently prints out a value around 0.96..

When I wrap the for loop inside Fibo() with a try-catch block like this:

static long Fibo(int n)
{
    long n1 = 0, n2 = 1, fibo = 0;
    n++;

    try
    {
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)
        {
            n1 = n2;
            n2 = fibo;
            fibo = n1 + n2;
        }
    }
    catch {}

    return fibo;
}


Now it consistently prints out 0.69... -- it actually runs faster! But why?

Note: I compiled this using the Release configuration and directly ran the EXE file (outside Visual Studio).

EDIT: Jon Skeet's excellent analysis shows that try-catch is somehow causing the x86 CLR to use the CPU registers in a more favorable way in this specific case (and I think we're yet to understand why). I confirmed Jon's finding that x64 CLR doesn't have this difference, and that it was faster than the x86 CLR. I also tested using int types inside the Fibo method instead of long types, and then the x86 CLR was as equally fast as the x64 CLR.



UPDATE: It looks like this issue has been fixed by Roslyn. Same machine, same CLR version -- the issue remains as above when compiled with VS 2013, but the problem goes away when compiled with VS 2015.

For the reverse, see How do I parse a string to a float or int?. floats can be handled similarly, but handling the decimal points can be tricky because floating-point values are not precise. See Converting a float to a string without rounding it for more specific advice.

I've read around about const and static readonly fields. We have some classes which contain only constant values. They are used for various things around in our system. So I am wondering if my observation is correct:
Should these kind of constant values always be static readonly for everything that is public? And only use const for internal/protected/private values?
What do you recommend? Should I maybe even not use static readonly fields, but rather use properties maybe?

761194	"Interface vs Abstract Class (general OO)

I have recently had two telephone interviews where I've been asked about the differences between an Interface and an Abstract class. I have explained every aspect of them I could think of, but it seems they are waiting for me to mention something specific, and I don't know what it is.
From my experience I think the following is true. If I am missing a major point please let me know.
Interface:
Every single Method declared in an Interface will have to be implemented in the subclass.
Only Events, Delegates, Properties (C#) and Methods can exist in an Interface. A class can implement multiple Interfaces.
Abstract Class:
Only Abstract methods have to be implemented by the subclass. An Abstract class can have normal methods with implementations. An Abstract class can also have class variables besides Events, Delegates, Properties and Methods. A class can implement one abstract class only due to the non-existence of Multi-inheritance in C#.

After all that, the interviewer came up with the question ""What if you had an Abstract class with only abstract methods? How would that be different from an interface?"" I didn't know the answer but I think it's the inheritance as mentioned above right?

Another interviewer asked me, ""What if you had a Public variable inside the interface, how would that be different than in a Abstract Class?"" I insisted you can't have a public variable inside an interface. I didn't know what he wanted to hear but he wasn't satisfied either.

"
6760685	"Creating a singleton in Python

This question is not for the discussion of whether or not the singleton design pattern is desirable, is an anti-pattern, or for any religious wars, but to discuss how this pattern is best implemented in Python in such a way that is most pythonic. In this instance I define 'most pythonic' to mean that it follows the 'principle of least astonishment'.
I have multiple classes which would become singletons (my use-case is for a logger, but this is not important). I do not wish to clutter several classes with added gumph when I can simply inherit or decorate.
Best methods:

Method 1: A decorator
def singleton(class_):
    instances = {}
    def getinstance(*args, **kwargs):
        if class_ not in instances:
            instances[class_] = class_(*args, **kwargs)
        return instances[class_]
    return getinstance

@singleton
class MyClass(BaseClass):
    pass

Pros

Decorators are additive in a way that is often more intuitive than multiple inheritance.

Cons

While objects created using MyClass() would be true singleton objects, MyClass itself is a function, not a class, so you cannot call class methods from it. Also for
x = MyClass();
y = MyClass();
t = type(n)();



then x == y but x != t && y != t

Method 2: A base class
class Singleton(object):
    _instance = None
    def __new__(class_, *args, **kwargs):
        if not isinstance(class_._instance, class_):
            class_._instance = object.__new__(class_, *args, **kwargs)
        return class_._instance

class MyClass(Singleton, BaseClass):
    pass

Pros

It's a true class

Cons

Multiple inheritance - eugh! __new__ could be overwritten during inheritance from a second base class? One has to think more than is necessary.


Method 3: A metaclass
class Singleton(type):
    _instances = {}
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            cls._instances[cls] = super(Singleton, cls).__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        return cls._instances[cls]

#Python2
class MyClass(BaseClass):
    __metaclass__ = Singleton

#Python3
class MyClass(BaseClass, metaclass=Singleton):
    pass

Pros

It's a true class
Auto-magically covers inheritance
Uses __metaclass__ for its proper purpose (and made me aware of it)

Cons

Are there any?


Method 4: decorator returning a class with the same name
def singleton(class_):
    class class_w(class_):
        _instance = None
        def __new__(class_, *args, **kwargs):
            if class_w._instance is None:
                class_w._instance = super(class_w,
                                    class_).__new__(class_,
                                                    *args,
                                                    **kwargs)
                class_w._instance._sealed = False
            return class_w._instance
        def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
            if self._sealed:
                return
            super(class_w, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
            self._sealed = True
    class_w.__name__ = class_.__name__
    return class_w

@singleton
class MyClass(BaseClass):
    pass

Pros

It's a true class
Auto-magically covers inheritance

Cons

Is there not an overhead for creating each new class? Here we are creating two classes for each class we wish to make a singleton. While this is fine in my case, I worry that this might not scale. Of course there is a matter of debate as to whether it aught to be too easy to scale this pattern...
What is the point of the _sealed attribute
Can't call methods of the same name on base classes using super() because they will recurse. This means you can't customize __new__ and can't subclass a class that needs you to call up to __init__.


Method 5: a module
a module file singleton.py
Pros

Simple is better than complex

Cons

Not lazily instantiated

I've been here:

Python packages: relative imports
python relative import example code does not work
Relative imports in python 2.5
Relative imports in Python
Python: Disabling relative import

and plenty of URLs that I did not copy, some on SO, some on other sites, back when I thought I'd have the solution quickly.
The forever-recurring question is this: how do I solve this ""Attempted relative import in non-package"" message?
ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package

I built an exact replica of the package on pep-0328:
package/
    __init__.py
    subpackage1/
        __init__.py
        moduleX.py
        moduleY.py
    subpackage2/
        __init__.py
        moduleZ.py
    moduleA.py

The imports were done from the console.
I did make functions named spam and eggs in their appropriate modules.  Naturally, it didn't work.  The answer is apparently in the 4th URL I listed, but it's all alumni to me. There was this response on one of the URLs I visited:

Relative imports use a module's name attribute to determine that module's position in the package hierarchy. If the module's name does not contain any package information (e.g. it is set to 'main') then relative imports are resolved as if the module were a top level module, regardless of where the module is actually located on the file system.

The above response looks promising, but it's all hieroglyphs to me.  So my question, how do I make Python not return to me ""Attempted relative import in non-package""? has an answer that involves -m, supposedly.
Can somebody please tell me why Python gives that error message, what it means by ""non-package"", why and how do you define a 'package', and the precise answer put in terms easy enough for a kindergartener to understand.

I noticed that JavaScript's new Date() function is very smart in accepting dates in several formats.

Xmas95 = new Date(""2009 06 12,12:52:39"")

I could not find documentation anywhere showing all the valid string formats while calling new Date() function.

This is for converting a string to a date. If we look at the opposite side, that is, converting a date object to a string, until now I was under the impression that JavaScript doesn't have a built-in API to format a date object into a string.


  Editor's note: The following approach is the asker's attempt that worked on a particular browser but does not work in general; see the answers on this page to see some actual solutions.


Today, I played with the toString() method on the date object and surprisingly it serves the purpose of formatting date to strings.

var d1 = new Date();
d1.toString('yyyy-MM-dd');       //Returns ""2009-06-29"" in Internet Explorer, but not Firefox or Chrome
d1.toString('dddd, MMMM ,yyyy')  //Returns ""Monday, June 29,2009"" in Internet Explorer, but not Firefox or Chrome


Also here I couldn't find any documentation on all the ways we can format the date object into a string.

Where is the documentation which lists the format specifiers supported by the Date() object?

Apparently, I have completely misunderstood its semantics. I thought of something like this:

The client triggers some functionality of MyCode.js, which in turn make requests to http://siteB, which should be fine, despite being cross-origin requests.

Well, I am wrong. It does not work like this at all. So, I have read Cross-origin resource sharing and attempted to read Cross-Origin Resource Sharing in w3c recommendation.

I'm having problems dealing with unicode characters from text fetched from different web pages (on different sites). I am using BeautifulSoup.

I have tried just about everything I can think of, and yet I have not found anything that works consistently without throwing some kind of Unicode-related error.

One of the sections of code that is causing problems is shown below:

agent_telno = agent.find('div', 'agent_contact_number')
agent_telno = '' if agent_telno is None else agent_telno.contents[0]
p.agent_info = str(agent_contact + ' ' + agent_telno).strip()

I suspect that this is because some pages (or more specifically, pages from some of the sites) may be encoded, whilst others may be unencoded.

1866794	"Naming Classes - How to avoid calling everything a ""<WhatEver>Manager""?

A long time ago I have read an article (I believe a blog entry) which put me on the ""right"" track on naming objects: Be very very scrupulous about naming things in your program.

For example if my application was (as a typical business app) handling users, companies and addresses I'd have a User, a Company and an Address domain class - and probably somewhere a UserManager, a CompanyManager and an AddressManager would pop up that handles those things.

So can you tell what those UserManager, CompanyManager and AddressManager do? No, because Manager is a very very generic term that fits to anything you can do with your domain objects.

The article I read recommended using very specific names. If it was a C++ application and the UserManager's job was allocating and freeing users from the heap it would not manage the users but guard their birth and death. Hmm, maybe we could call this a UserShepherd.

Or maybe the UserManager's job is to examine each User object's data and sign the data cryptographically. Then we'd have a UserRecordsClerk.

Now that this idea stuck with me I try to apply it. And find this simple idea amazingly hard.

I can describe what the classes do and (as long as I don't slip into quick & dirty coding) the classes I write do exactly one thing. What I miss to go from that description to the names is a kind of catalogue of names, a vocabulary that maps the concepts to names.

Ultimately I'd like to have something like a pattern catalogue in my mind (frequently design patterns easily provide the object names, e.g. a factory)


Factory - Creates other objects (naming taken from the design pattern)
Shepherd - A shepherd handles the lifetime of objects, their creation and shutdown
Synchronizer - Copies data between two or more objects (or object hierarchies)
Nanny - Helps objects reach ""usable"" state after creation - for example by wiring to other objects
etc etc.


So, how do you handle that issue? Do you have a fixed vocabulary, do you invent new names on the fly or do you consider naming things not-so-important or wrong?

P.S.: I'm also interested in links to articles and blogs discussing the issue. As a start, here is the original article that got me thinking about it: Naming Java Classes without a 'Manager'



Update: Summary of answers

Here's a little summary of what I learned from this question in the meantime.


Try not to create new metaphors (Nanny)
Have a look at what other frameworks do

And a current list of name prefixes/suffixes I collected (subjectively!) from the answers:

Reader
Handler
Container
Protocol
Target
Converter
Controller
View
Factory

And a good tip for the road:

153724	"How to round a number to n decimal places in Java

What I would like is a method to convert a double to a string which rounds using the half-up method - i.e. if the decimal to be rounded is 5, it always rounds up to the next number. This is the standard method of rounding most people expect in most situations.

I also would like only significant digits to be displayed - i.e. there should not be any trailing zeroes.

I know one method of doing this is to use the String.format method:

String.format(""%.5g%n"", 0.912385);


returns:

0.91239


which is great, however it always displays numbers with 5 decimal places even if they are not significant: 

String.format(""%.5g%n"", 0.912300);


returns:

0.91230


Another method is to use the DecimalFormatter:

DecimalFormat df = new DecimalFormat(""#.#####"");
df.format(0.912385);


returns:

0.91238


However as you can see this uses half-even rounding. That is it will round down if the previous digit is even. What I'd like is this:

0.912385 -> 0.91239
0.912300 -> 0.9123

I'm working on implementing a widget transparency option for my app widget although I'm having some trouble getting the hex color values right. Being completely new to hex color transparency I searched around a bit although I couldn't find a specific answer to my question. 

I want to set transparency by hex color so let's say my hex color id ""#33b5e5"" and I want it to be 50% transparent. Then I'll use ""#8033b5e5"" because 80 is 50%. 

I found a useful chart here: http://www.dtp-aus.com/hexadeci.htm . With this data I managed to come up with this:

0% = #00
10% = #16
20% = #32
30% = #48
40% = #64
50% = #80
60% = #96
70% = #112
80% = #128
90% = #144


Now the issues start appearing when I get higher than 100 in hex. Hex color codes can only be 8 symbols long right? For example #11233b5e5 (80%) crashes.

What can I do to enable me to use the higher numbers aswell?

  ""editor.ruler"": 80

The issue I am having with the default VS Code configuration (as shown above) is that it only renders a single ruler. In the Sublime Text Editor I can render as many rulers as I like using the following Sublime configuration.
  ""rulers"": [72, 80, 100, 120]

Is it possible to render multiple rulers in V.S. Code. If it is possible, What does a multi-ruler configuration look like in VS Code?

585945	"How to align content of a div to the bottom

Say I have the following CSS and HTML code:



#header {
  height: 150px;
}
<div id=""header"">
  <h1>Header title</h1>
  Header content (one or multiple lines)
</div>




The header section is fixed height, but the header content may change.

I would like the content of the header to be vertically aligned to the bottom of the header section, so the last line of text ""sticks"" to the bottom of the header section.

So if there is only one line of text, it would be like:


-----------------------------
| Header title
|
|
|
| header content (resulting in one line)
-----------------------------


And if there were three lines:


-----------------------------
| Header title
|
| header content (which is so
| much stuff that it perfectly
| spans over three lines)
-----------------------------


How can this be done in CSS?

477572	"Strange OutOfMemory issue while loading an image to a Bitmap object

I have a ListView with a couple of image buttons on each row. When the user clicks the list row, it launches a new activity. I have had to build my own tabs because of an issue with the camera layout. The activity that gets launched for the result is a map. If I click on my button to launch the image preview (load an image off the SD card) the application returns from the activity back to the ListView activity to the result handler to relaunch my new activity which is nothing more than an image widget.
The image preview on the ListView is being done with the cursor and ListAdapter. This makes it pretty simple, but I am not sure how I can put a resized image (I.e. Smaller bit size not pixel as the src for the image button on the fly. So I just resized the image that came off the phone camera.
The issue is that I get an OutOfMemoryError when it tries to go back and re-launch the 2nd activity.

Is there a way I can build the list adapter easily row by row, where I can resize on the fly (bitwise)?

This would be preferable as I also need to make some changes to the properties of the widgets/elements in each row as I am unable to select a row with the touch screen because of the focus issue. (I can use rollerball.)

I know I can do an out of band resize and save my image, but that is not really what I want to do, but some sample code for that would be nice.

As soon as I disabled the image on the ListView it worked fine again.
FYI: This is how I was doing it:
String[] from = new String[] { DBHelper.KEY_BUSINESSNAME, DBHelper.KEY_ADDRESS,
    DBHelper.KEY_CITY, DBHelper.KEY_GPSLONG, DBHelper.KEY_GPSLAT,
    DBHelper.KEY_IMAGEFILENAME  + """"};
int[] to = new int[] { R.id.businessname, R.id.address, R.id.city, R.id.gpslong,
    R.id.gpslat, R.id.imagefilename };
notes = new SimpleCursorAdapter(this, R.layout.notes_row, c, from, to);
setListAdapter(notes);

Where R.id.imagefilename is a ButtonImage.

There is a logic going on for rendering between parent and children components of course, you can imagine <select> and <option> as an example of this logic.

289727	"Which MySQL data type to use for storing boolean values

Since MySQL doesn't seem to have any 'boolean' data type, which data type do you 'abuse' for storing true/false information in MySQL?

Especially in the context of writing and reading from/to a PHP script.

Over time I have used and seen several approaches:


tinyint, varchar fields containing the values 0/1,
varchar fields containing the strings '0'/'1' or 'true'/'false'
and finally enum Fields containing the two options 'true'/'false'.


None of the above seems optimal. I tend to prefer the tinyint 0/1 variant, since automatic type conversion in PHP gives me boolean values rather simply.

So which data type do you use? Is there a type designed for boolean values which I have overlooked? Do you see any advantages/disadvantages by using one type or another?

Let’s say we have the following situation in Git:


A created repository:

echo ""On Master"" > file
git commit -a -m ""Initial commit""

Feature1 branched off master and some work is done:

git branch feature1
git checkout feature1
echo ""Feature1"" > featureFile
git commit -a -m ""Commit for feature1""

Meanwhile, a bug is discovered in the master-code and a hotfix-branch is established:

git checkout master
git branch hotfix1
git checkout hotfix1

The bug is fixed in the hotfix branch and merged back into the master (perhaps after a pull request/code review):

echo ""Bugfix"" > bugfixFile
git commit -a -m ""Bugfix Commit""
git checkout master
git merge --no-ff hotfix1

Development on feature1 continues:

git checkout feature1

I want to prevent to get two new commits on my feature branch which have no relation to the feature implementation.

2283937	"How should I ethically approach user password storage for later plaintext retrieval?

As I continue to build more and more websites and web applications I am often asked to store user's passwords in a way that they can be retrieved if/when the user has an issue (either to email a forgotten password link, walk them through over the phone, etc.)  When I can I fight bitterly against this practice and I do a lot of ‘extra’ programming to make password resets and administrative assistance possible without storing their actual password.

When I can’t fight it (or can’t win) then I always encode the password in some way so that it, at least, isn’t stored as plaintext in the database—though I am aware that if my DB gets hacked it wouldn't take much for the culprit to crack the passwords, so that makes me uncomfortable.

In a perfect world folks would update passwords frequently and not duplicate them across many different sites—unfortunately I know MANY people that have the same work/home/email/bank password, and have even freely given it to me when they need assistance.  I don’t want to be the one responsible for their financial demise if my DB security procedures fail for some reason.

Morally and ethically I feel responsible for protecting what can be, for some users, their livelihood even if they are treating it with much less respect.
I am certain that there are many avenues to approach and arguments to be made for salting hashes and different encoding options, but is there a single ‘best practice’ when you have to store them?  In almost all cases I am using PHP and MySQL if that makes any difference in the way I should handle the specifics.

Additional Information for Bounty

I want to clarify that I know this is not something you want to have to do and that in most cases refusal to do so is best.  I am, however, not looking for a lecture on the merits of taking this approach I am looking for the best steps to take if you do take this approach.

In a note below I made the point that websites geared largely toward the elderly, mentally challenged, or very young can become confusing for people when they are asked to perform a secure password recovery routine.  Though we may find it simple and mundane in those cases some users need the extra assistance of either having a service tech help them into the system or having it emailed/displayed directly to them.  

In such systems the attrition rate from these demographics could hobble the application if users were not given this level of access assistance, so please answer with such a setup in mind.

Thanks to Everyone

This has been a fun question with lots of debate and I have enjoyed it.  In the end I selected an answer that both retains password security (I will not have to keep plain text or recoverable passwords), but also makes it possible for the user base I specified to log into a system without the major drawbacks I have found from normal password recovery.

As always there were about 5 answers that I would like to have marked as correct for different reasons, but I had to choose the best one--all the rest got a +1.  Thanks everyone!

Also, thanks to everyone in the Stack community who voted for this question and/or marked it as a favorite.  I take hitting 100 up votes as a compliment and hope that this discussion has helped someone else with the same concern that I had.

This would allow me to link from one .md to another within the same branch and not have to worry about which branch I'm in (avoid having to do an absolute URL that includes the github.com branch name).

Here is a working example of what I mean:


GOTO http://github.com/rynop/testRel, link does not work.
GOTO http://github.com/rynop/testRel/blob/master/README.md, link works.


This is expected because at this point the starting URL is in the branch. Now how do I get it to pick up the current branch in the README.md at the root of the repository?

Update: I opened an issue against GitHub for this feature request.

Trying to get the highest and lowest value from an array that I know will contain only integers seems to be harder than I thought.


var numArray = [140000, 104, 99];
numArray = numArray.sort();
console.log(numArray)



I'd expect this to show 99, 104, 140000. Instead it shows 104, 140000, 99. So it seems the sort is handling the values as strings.
Is there a way to get the sort function to actually sort on integer value?

1678122	"'Must Override a Superclass Method' Errors after importing a project into Eclipse

Anytime I have to re-import my projects into Eclipse (if I reinstalled Eclipse, or changed the location of the projects), almost all of my overridden methods are not formatted correctly, causing the error:


  The method must override a superclass method


It may be noteworthy to mention this is with Android projects for whatever reason, the method argument values are not always populated, so I have to manually populate them myself. For instance:

list.setOnCreateContextMenuListener(new OnCreateContextMenuListener() {

    //These arguments have their correct names
    public void onCreateContextMenu(ContextMenu menu, View v, 
                                    ContextMenuInfo menuInfo) {                 
    }

});


will be initially populated like this:

list.setOnCreateContextMenuListener(new OnCreateContextMenuListener() {

    //This methods arguments were not automatically provided    
    public void onCreateContextMenu(ContextMenu arg1, View arg2,
                                    ContextMenuInfo arg3) {
    }

});


The odd thing is, if I remove my code, and have Eclipse automatically recreate the method, it uses the same argument names I already had, so I don't really know where the problem is, other then it auto-formatting the method for me.

This becomes quite a pain having to manually recreate ALL my overridden methods by hand. If anyone can explain why this happens or how to fix it. I would be very happy.

Maybe it is due to the way I am formatting the methods, which are inside an argument of another method?

254514	"Enumerations on PHP

I know that PHP doesn't yet have native Enumerations. But I have become accustomed to them from the Java world. I would love to use enums as a way to give predefined values which IDEs' auto-completion features could understand.
Constants do the trick, but there's the namespace collision problem and (or actually because) they're global. Arrays don't have the namespace problem, but they're too vague, they can be overwritten at runtime and IDEs rarely know how to autofill their keys without additional static analysis annotations or attributes.
Are there any solutions/workarounds you commonly use? Does anyone recall whether the PHP guys have had any thoughts or decisions around enumerations?

I would like to understand how the built-in function property works. What confuses me is that property can also be used as a decorator, but it only takes arguments when used as a built-in function and not when used as a decorator.
This example is from the documentation:
class C:
    def __init__(self):
        self._x = None

    def getx(self):
        return self._x
    def setx(self, value):

    def delx(self):
        del self._x
    x = property(getx, setx, delx, ""I'm the 'x' property."")

property's arguments are getx, setx, delx and a doc string.
In the code below property is used as a decorator. The object of it is the x function, but in the code above there is no place for an object function in the arguments.
class C:
    def __init__(self):
        self._x = None

    @property
    def x(self):
        """"""I'm the 'x' property.""""""

3492302	"Easy interview question got harder: given numbers 1..100, find the missing number(s) given exactly k are missing

I had an interesting job interview experience a while back. The question started really easy:

Q1: We have a bag containing numbers 1, 2, 3, …, 100. Each number appears exactly once, so there are 100 numbers. Now one number is randomly picked out of the bag. Find the missing number.

I've heard this interview question before, of course, so I very quickly answered along the lines of:

A1: Well, the sum of the numbers 1 + 2 + 3 + … + N is (N+1)(N/2) (see Wikipedia: sum of arithmetic series). For N = 100, the sum is 5050.
Thus, if all numbers are present in the bag, the sum will be exactly 5050. Since one number is missing, the sum will be less than this, and the difference is that number. So we can find that missing number in O(N) time and O(1) space.

At this point I thought I had done well, but all of a sudden the question took an unexpected turn:

Q2: That is correct, but now how would you do this if TWO numbers are missing?

I had never seen/heard/considered this variation before, so I panicked and couldn't answer the question. The interviewer insisted on knowing my thought process, so I mentioned that perhaps we can get more information by comparing against the expected product, or perhaps doing a second pass after having gathered some information from the first pass, etc, but I really was just shooting in the dark rather than actually having a clear path to the solution.
The interviewer did try to encourage me by saying that having a second equation is indeed one way to solve the problem. At this point I was kind of upset (for not knowing the answer before hand), and asked if this is a general (read: ""useful"") programming technique, or if it's just a trick/gotcha answer.
The interviewer's answer surprised me: you can generalize the technique to find 3 missing numbers. In fact, you can generalize it to find k missing numbers.

Qk: If exactly k numbers are missing from the bag, how would you find it efficiently?

This was a few months ago, and I still couldn't figure out what this technique is.  Obviously there's a Ω(N) time lower bound since we must scan all the numbers at least once, but the interviewer insisted that the TIME and SPACE complexity of the solving technique (minus the O(N) time input scan) is defined in k not N.
So the question here is simple:

How would you solve Q2?
How would you solve Q3?
How would you solve Qk?


Clarifications

Generally there are N numbers from 1..N, not just 1..100.
I'm not looking for the obvious set-based solution, e.g. using a bit set, encoding the presence/absence each number by the value of a designated bit, therefore using O(N) bits in additional space. We can't afford any additional space proportional to N.
I'm also not looking for the obvious sort-first approach. This and the set-based approach are worth mentioning in an interview (they are easy to implement, and depending on N, can be very practical). I'm looking for the Holy Grail solution (which may or may not be practical to implement, but has the desired asymptotic characteristics nevertheless).

So again, of course you must scan the input in O(N), but you can only capture small amount of information (defined in terms of k not N), and must then find the k missing numbers somehow.

2802726	"Putting a simple if-then-else statement on one line

  A clustered index is a special type of index that reorders  the way

  one clustered index. The leaf  nodes
  of a clustered index contain the data
  pages. A nonclustered index is a

  match the physical  stored order of
  the rows on disk. The leaf node of a

OK, I thought this was a simple git scenario, what am I missing?

I have a master branch and a feature branch. I do some work on master, some on feature, and then some more on master. I end up with something like this (lexicographic order implies the order of commits):

I have no problem to git push origin master to keep the remote master updated, nor with git push origin feature (when on feature) to maintain a remote backup for my feature work. Up until now, we're good.

But now I want to rebase feature on top of the F--G commits on master, so I git checkout feature and git rebase master. Still good. Now we have:

A--B--C------F--G  (master)

I hate using --force without being sure I need it. So, do I need it? Does the rebasing necessarily imply that the next push should be --forceful?

This feature branch is not shared with any other devs, so I have no problem de facto with the force push, I'm not going to lose any data, the question is more conceptual.

It is currently said that MD5 is partially unsafe. Taking this into consideration, I'd like to know which mechanism to use for password protection.

This question, Is “double hashing” a password less secure than just hashing it once? 
suggests that hashing multiple times may be a good idea, whereas How to implement password protection for individual files? suggests using salt.

I'm using PHP. I want a safe and fast password encryption system. Hashing a password a million times may be safer, but also slower. How to achieve a good balance between speed and safety? Also, I'd prefer the result to have a constant number of characters.


The hashing mechanism must be available in PHP
It must be safe
It can use salt (in this case, are all salts equally good? Is there any way to generate good salts?)


Also, should I store two fields in the database (one using MD5 and another one using SHA, for example)? Would it make it safer or unsafer?

In case I wasn't clear enough, I want to know which hashing function(s) to use and how to pick a good salt in order to have a safe and fast password protection mechanism.

2033914	"Is quitting an application frowned upon?

Moving on in my attempt to learn Android, I just read the following:


  Question: Does the user have a choice to kill the application 
  unless we put a menu option in to kill it? If no such option exists, 
  how does the user terminate the application? 
  
  Answer: (Romain Guy): The user doesn't, the system handles this automatically. That's what the activity lifecycle (especially onPause/onStop/onDestroy) is for. No matter what you do, do not put a ""quit"" or ""exit"" application button. It is useless with Android's application model. This is also contrary to how core applications work. 


Hehe, for every step I take in the Android world I run into some sort of problem =(

Apparently, you cannot quit an application in Android (but the Android system can very well totally destroy your app whenever it feels like it). What's up with that? I am starting to think that it's impossible to write an app that functions as a ""normal app"" - that the user can quit the app when he/she decides to do so. That is not something that should be relied upon the OS to do.

The application I am trying to create is not an application for the Android Market. It is not an application for ""wide use"" by the general public, it is a business app that is going to be used in a very narrow business field.

I was actually really looking forward to developing for the Android platform, since it addresses a lot of issues that exist in Windows Mobile and .NET. However, the last week has been somewhat of a turnoff for me... I hope I don't have to abandon Android, but it doesn't look very good right now =(

Is there a way for me to really quit the application?

4191386	"jQuery how to find an element based on a data-attribute value?

I've got the following scenario:

var el = 'li';


and there are 5 <li>'s on the page each with a data-slide=number attribute (number being 1,2,3,4,5 respectively).

I now need to find the currently active slide number which is mapped to var current = $('ul').data(current); and is updated on each slide change.

So far my tries have been unsuccessful, trying to construct the selector that would match the current slide:

$('ul').find(el+[data-slide=+current+]);


does not match/return anything…

The reason I can't hardcode the li part is that this is a user accessible variable that can be changed to a different element if required, so it may not always be an li.

Any ideas on what I'm missing?

I can't get to the bottom of this error, because when the debugger is attached, it does not seem to occur.

Collection was modified; enumeration operation may not execute

Below is the code.
This is a WCF server in a Windows service. The method NotifySubscribers() is called by the service whenever there is a data event (at random intervals, but not very often - about 800 times per day).
When a Windows Forms client subscribes, the subscriber ID is added to the subscribers dictionary, and when the client unsubscribes, it is deleted from the dictionary. The error happens when (or after) a client unsubscribes. It appears that the next time the NotifySubscribers() method is called, the foreach() loop fails with the error in the subject line. The method writes the error into the application log as shown in the code below. When a debugger is attached and a client unsubscribes, the code executes fine.
Do you see a problem with this code? Do I need to make the dictionary thread-safe?

I have a shopping cart that displays product options in a dropdown menu and if they select ""yes"", I want to make some other fields on the page visible. 

The problem is that the shopping cart also includes the price modifier in the text, which can be different for each product. The following code works:

$(document).ready(function() {
    $('select[id=""Engraving""]').change(function() {
        var str = $('select[id=""Engraving""] option:selected').text();

3505701	"Grouping functions (tapply, by, aggregate) and the *apply family

Whenever I want to do something ""map""py in R, I usually try to use a function in the apply family. 

However, I've never quite understood the differences between them -- how {sapply, lapply, etc.} apply the function to the input/grouped input, what the output will look like, or even what the input can be -- so I often just go through them all until I get what I want.

Can someone explain how to use which one when?

My current (probably incorrect/incomplete) understanding is...


sapply(vec, f): input is a vector. output is a vector/matrix, where element i is f(vec[i]), giving you a matrix if f has a multi-element output
lapply(vec, f): same as sapply, but output is a list?
apply(matrix, 1/2, f): input is a matrix. output is a vector, where element i is f(row/col i of the matrix)
tapply(vector, grouping, f): output is a matrix/array, where an element in the matrix/array is the value of f at a grouping g of the vector, and g gets pushed to the row/col names
by(dataframe, grouping, f): let g be a grouping. apply f to each column of the group/dataframe. pretty print the grouping and the value of f at each column.
aggregate(matrix, grouping, f): similar to by, but instead of pretty printing the output, aggregate sticks everything into a dataframe.

327955	"Does functional programming replace GoF design patterns?

Since I started learning F# and OCaml last year, I've read a huge number of articles which insist that design patterns (especially in Java) are workarounds for the missing features in imperative languages. One article I found makes a fairly strong claim:


  Most people I've met have read 
  the Design Patterns book by the Gang of
  Four (GoF). Any self respecting programmer
  will tell you that the book is
  language agnostic and the patterns
  apply to software engineering in
  general, regardless of which language
  you use. This is a noble claim.
  Unfortunately it is far removed from
  the truth.
  
  Functional languages are extremely
  expressive. In a functional language
  one does not need design patterns
  because the language is likely so high
  level, you end up programming in
  concepts that eliminate design
  patterns all together.


The main features of functional programming (FP) include functions as first-class values, currying, immutable values, etc. It doesn't seem obvious to me that OO design patterns are approximating any of those features.

Additionally, in functional languages which support OOP (such as F# and OCaml), it seems obvious to me that programmers using these languages would use the same design patterns found available to every other OOP language. In fact, right now I use F# and OCaml every day, and there are no striking differences between the patterns I use in these languages vs. the patterns I use when I write in Java.

Is there any truth to the claim that functional programming eliminates the need for OOP design patterns? If so, could you post or link to an example of a typical OOP design pattern and its functional equivalent?
"
28459418	"Use of PUT vs PATCH methods in REST API real life scenarios

First of all, some definitions:
PUT is defined in Section 9.6 RFC 2616:

The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers to an already existing resource, the enclosed entity SHOULD be considered as a modified version of the one residing on the origin server. If the Request-URI does not point to an existing resource, and that URI is capable of being defined as a new resource by the requesting user agent, the origin server can create the resource with that URI.

PATCH is defined in RFC 5789:

The PATCH method requests that a set of changes described in the
request entity be applied to the resource identified by the Request-
URI.

Also according to RFC 2616 Section 9.1.2 PUT is Idempotent while PATCH is not.
Now let us take a look at a real example. When I do POST to /users with the data {username: 'skwee357', email: 'skwee357@domain.example'} and the server is capable of creating a resource, it will respond with 201 and resource location (lets assume /users/1) and any next call to GET /users/1 will return {id: 1, username: 'skwee357', email: 'skwee357@domain.example'}.
Now let us say I want to modify my email. Email modification is considered ""a set of changes"" and therefore I should PATCH /users/1 with ""patch document"". In my case it would be the JSON document: {email: 'skwee357@newdomain.example'}. The server then returns 200 (assuming permission are ok). This brings me to first question:

PATCH is NOT idempotent. It said so in RFC 2616 and RFC 5789. However if I issue the same PATCH request (with my new email), I will get the same resource state (with my email being modified to the requested value). Why is PATCH not then idempotent?

PATCH is a relatively new verb (RFC introduced in March 2010), and it comes to solve the problem of ""patching"" or modifying a set of fields. Before PATCH was introduced, everybody used PUT to update resources. But after PATCH was introduced, it leaves me confused about what PUT is used for. And this brings me to my second (and the main) question:

What is the real difference between PUT and PATCH? I have read somewhere that PUT might be used to replace entire entity under specific resource, so one should send the full entity (instead of set of attributes as with PATCH). What is the real practical usage for such case? When would you like to replace / overwrite an entity at a specific resource URI and why is such an operation not considered updating / patching the entity? The only practical use case I see for PUT is issuing a PUT on a collection, i.e. /users to replace the entire collection. Issuing PUT on a specific entity makes no sense after PATCH was introduced. Am I wrong?

As I understand, official redux doc motivations provide pros comparing to traditional MVC architectures. BUT it doesn't provide an answer to the question: 

Why you should use Redux over Facebook Flux? 

Is that only a question of programming styles: functional vs non-functional? Or the question is in abilities/dev-tools that follow from redux approach? Maybe scaling? Or testing?

To answer this question you may compare the complexity of implementation redux's motivation points on flux vs redux.

Here are motivation points from official redux doc motivations:


Handling optimistic updates (as I understand, it hardly depends on 5th point. Is it hard to implement it in facebook flux?)
Rendering on the server (facebook flux also can do this. Any benefits comparing to redux?)
Fetching data before performing route transitions (Why it can't be achieved in facebook flux? What's the benefits?)

Any other points? Like persisting state...

I have read (vaguely, through posts on the Internet) that cross apply can be more efficient when selecting over large data sets if you are partitioning. (Paging comes to mind)

I also know that CROSS APPLY doesn't require a UDF as the right-table.

In most INNER JOIN queries (one-to-many relationships), I could rewrite them to use CROSS APPLY, but they always give me equivalent execution plans. 

Can anyone give me a good example of when CROSS APPLY makes a difference in those cases where INNER JOIN will work as well?

But if I'm going through my command history via the ↑ key and start editing or using those commands, ↓ will only change the prompt to the next newest command in history, so it doesn't work here unless I press ↓ multiple times.

92396	"Why can't variables be declared in a switch statement?

I've always wondered this - why can't you declare variables after a case label in a switch statement?  In C++ you can declare variables pretty much anywhere (and declaring them close to first use is obviously a good thing) but the following still won't work:

switch (val)  
{  
case VAL:  
  // This won't work
  int newVal = 42;  
  break;
case ANOTHER_VAL:  
  ...
  break;
}  


The above gives me the following error (MSC):


  initialization of 'newVal' is skipped by 'case' label


This seems to be a limitation in other languages too.  Why is this such a problem?

43871637	"No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource—when trying to get data from a REST API

I'm trying to fetch some data from the REST API of HP Alm. It works pretty well with a small curl script—I get my data.
Now doing that with JavaScript, fetch and ES6 (more or less) seems to be a bigger issue. I keep getting this error message:

Fetch API cannot load . Response to preflight request doesn't
pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is
present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://127.0.0.1:3000' is
therefore not allowed access. The response had HTTP status code 501.
If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to
'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.

I understand that this is because I am trying to fetch that data from within my localhost and the solution should be using Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). I thought I actually did that, but somehow it either ignores what I write in the header or the problem is something else.
So, is there an implementation issue? Am I doing it wrong? I can't check the server logs unfortunately. I'm really a bit stuck here.
function performSignIn() {

  let headers = new Headers();

  headers.append('Content-Type', 'application/json');

36795819	"When should I use curly braces for ES6 import?

It seems to be obvious, but I found myself a bit confused about when to use curly braces for importing a single module in ES6. For example, in the React-Native project I am working on, I have the following file and its content:
File initialState.js
var initialState = {
    todo: {
        todos: [
            {id: 1, task: 'Finish Coding', completed: false},
            {id: 2, task: 'Do Laundry', completed: false},
            {id: 2, task: 'Shopping Groceries', completed: false},
        ]
    }
};

export default initialState;

In the TodoReducer.js, I have to import it without curly braces:
import initialState from './todoInitialState';

If I enclose the initialState in curly braces, I get the following error for the following line of code:

Cannot read property todo of undefined

File TodoReducer.js:
export default function todos(state = initialState.todo, action) {
    // ...
}

Similar errors also happen to my components with the curly braces. I was wondering when I should use curly braces for a single import, because obviously, when importing multiple component/modules, you have to enclose them in curly braces, which I know.
The Stack Overflow post at here does not answer my question, instead I am asking when I should or should not use curly braces for importing a single module, or I should never use curly braces for importing a single module in ES6 (this is apparently not the case, as I have seen single import with curly braces required).

How do people deal with persistent storage for your Docker containers?

I am currently using this approach: build the image, e.g. for PostgreSQL, and then start the container with

docker run --volumes-from c0dbc34fd631 -d app_name/postgres


IMHO, that has the drawback, that I must not ever (by accident) delete container ""c0dbc34fd631"".

Another idea would be to mount host volumes ""-v"" into the container, however, the userid within the container does not necessarily match the userid from the host, and then permissions might be messed up.

Note: Instead of --volumes-from 'cryptic_id' you can also use --volumes-from my-data-container where my-data-container is a name you assigned to a data-only container, e.g. docker run --name my-data-container ... (see the accepted answer)

779379	"Why is setTimeout(fn, 0) sometimes useful?

I've recently run into a rather nasty bug, wherein the code was loading a <select> dynamically via JavaScript.  This dynamically loaded <select> had a pre-selected value.  In IE6, we already had code to fix the selected <option>, because sometimes the <select>'s selectedIndex value would be out of sync with the selected <option>'s index attribute, as below:

field.selectedIndex = element.index;


However, this code wasn't working.  Even though the field's selectedIndex was being set correctly, the wrong index would end up being selected.  However, if I stuck an alert() statement in at the right time, the correct option would be selected.  Thinking this might be some sort of timing issue, I tried something random that I'd seen in code before:

var wrapFn = (function() {
    var myField = field;
    var myElement = element;

    return function() {
        myField.selectedIndex = myElement.index;
    }
})();
setTimeout(wrapFn, 0);


And this worked!

I've got a solution for my problem, but I'm uneasy that I don't know exactly why this fixes my problem.  Does anyone have an official explanation?  What browser issue am I avoiding by calling my function ""later"" using setTimeout()?

11605917	"'this' vs $scope in AngularJS controllers

In the ""Create Components"" section of AngularJS's homepage, there is this example:

controller: function($scope, $element) {
  var panes = $scope.panes = [];
  $scope.select = function(pane) {
    angular.forEach(panes, function(pane) {
      pane.selected = false;
    });
    pane.selected = true;
  }
  this.addPane = function(pane) {
    if (panes.length == 0) $scope.select(pane);
    panes.push(pane);
  }
}


Notice how the select method is added to $scope, but the addPane method is added to this. If I change it to $scope.addPane, the code breaks.

The documentation says that there in fact is a difference, but it doesn't mention what the difference is:


  Previous versions of Angular (pre 1.0 RC) allowed you to use this interchangeably with the $scope method, but this is no longer the case. Inside of methods defined on the scope this and $scope are interchangeable (angular sets this to $scope), but not otherwise inside your controller constructor.

I am looking for a command that will accept (as input) multiple lines of text, each line containing a single integer, and output the sum of these integers.

As a bit of background, I have a log file which includes timing measurements. Through grepping for the relevant lines and a bit of sed reformatting I can list all of the timings in that file.  I would like to work out the total. I can pipe this intermediate output to any command in order to do the final sum.

457927	"Git workflow and rebase vs merge questions

I've been using Git now for a couple of months on a project with one other developer. I have several years of experience with SVN, so I guess I bring a lot of baggage to the relationship.

I have heard that Git is excellent for branching and merging, and so far, I just don't see it. Sure, branching is dead simple, but when I try to merge, everything goes all to hell. Now, I'm used to that from SVN, but it seems to me that I just traded one sub-par versioning system for another.

My partner tells me that my problems stem from my desire to merge willy-nilly, and that I should be using rebase instead of merge in many situations. For example, here's the workflow that he's laid down:

clone the remote repository
git checkout -b my_new_feature
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..finish the feature
git checkout master
git merge my_new_feature


Essentially, create a feature branch, ALWAYS rebase from master to the branch, and merge from the branch back to master. Important to note is that the branch always stays local.

Here is the workflow that I started with

clone remote repository
create my_new_feature branch on remote repository
git checkout -b --track my_new_feature origin/my_new_feature
..work, commit, push to origin/my_new_feature
git merge master (to get some changes that my partner added)
..work, commit, push to origin/my_new_feature
git merge master
..finish my_new_feature, push to origin/my_new_feature
git checkout master
git merge my_new_feature
delete remote branch
delete local branch


There are two essential differences (I think): I use merge always instead of rebasing, and I push my feature branch (and my feature branch commits) to the remote repository.

My reasoning for the remote branch is that I want my work backed up as I'm working. Our repository is automatically backed up and can be restored if something goes wrong. My laptop is not, or not as thoroughly. Therefore, I hate to have code on my laptop that's not mirrored somewhere else.

My reasoning for the merge instead of rebase is that merge seems to be standard and rebase seems to be an advanced feature. My gut feeling is that what I'm trying to do is not an advanced setup, so rebase should be unnecessary. I've even perused the new Pragmatic Programming book on Git, and they cover merge extensively and barely mention rebase.

Anyway, I was following my workflow on a recent branch, and when I tried to merge it back to master, it all went to hell. There were tons of conflicts with things that should have not mattered. The conflicts just made no sense to me. It took me a day to sort everything out, and eventually culminated in a forced push to the remote master, since my local master has all conflicts resolved, but the remote one still wasn't happy.

What is the ""correct"" workflow for something like this? Git is supposed to make branching and merging super-easy, and I'm just not seeing it.

Update 2011-04-15

This seems to be a very popular question, so I thought I'd update with my two years experience since I first asked.

It turns out that the original workflow is correct, at least in our case. In other words, this is what we do and it works:

clone the remote repository
git checkout -b my_new_feature
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..finish the feature, commit
git rebase master
git checkout master
git merge my_new_feature


In fact, our workflow is a little different, as we tend to do squash merges instead of raw merges. (Note: This is controversial, see below.) This allows us to turn our entire feature branch into a single commit on master. Then we delete our feature branch. This allows us to logically structure our commits on master, even if they're a little messy on our branches. So, this is what we do:

clone the remote repository
git checkout -b my_new_feature
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..finish the feature, commit
git rebase master
git checkout master
git merge --squash my_new_feature
git commit -m ""added my_new_feature""
git branch -D my_new_feature


Squash Merge Controversy - As several commenters have pointed out, the squash merge will throw away all history on your feature branch. As the name implies, it squashes all the commits down into a single one. For small features, this makes sense as it condenses it down into a single package. For larger features, it's probably not a great idea, especially if your individual commits are already atomic. It really comes down to personal preference.

Github and Bitbucket (others?) Pull Requests - In case you're wondering how merge/rebase relates to Pull Requests, I recommend following all the above steps up until you're ready to merge back to master. Instead of manually merging with git, you just accept the PR. Note that this will not do a squash merge (at least not by default), but non-squash, non-fast-forward is the accepted merge convention in the Pull Request community (as far as I know). Specifically, it works like this:

clone the remote repository
git checkout -b my_new_feature
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..work and commit some stuff
git rebase master
..finish the feature, commit
git rebase master
git push # May need to force push
...submit PR, wait for a review, make any changes requested for the PR
git rebase master
git push # Will probably need to force push (-f), due to previous rebases from master
...accept the PR, most likely also deleting the feature branch in the process
git checkout master
git branch -d my_new_feature
git remote prune origin


I've come to love Git and never want to go back to SVN. If you're struggling, just stick with it and eventually you'll see the light at the end of the tunnel.

11032015	"How can I find the time complexity of an algorithm?

I have gone through Google and Stack Overflow search, but nowhere I was able to find a clear and straightforward explanation for how to calculate time complexity.
What do I know already?
Say for code as simple as the one below:
char h = 'y'; // This will be executed 1 time
int abc = 0; // This will be executed 1 time

Say for a loop like the one below:
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    Console.Write('Hello, World!!');
}


int i=0; This will be executed only once.

The time is actually calculated to i=0 and not the declaration.

i < N; This will be executed N+1 times
i++ This will be executed N times

So the number of operations required by this loop are {1+(N+1)+N} = 2N+2. (But this still may be wrong, as I am not confident about my understanding.)
OK, so these small basic calculations I think I know, but in most cases I have seen the time complexity as O(N), O(n^2), O(log n), O(n!), and many others.

12622424	"How do I animate constraint changes?

I'm updating an old app with an AdBannerView and when there is no ad, it slides off screen. When there is an ad it slides on the screen. Basic stuff.
Old style, I set the frame in an animation block.
New style, I have a IBOutlet to the auto-layout constraint which determines the Y position, in this case it's distance from the bottom of the superview, and modify the constant:
- (void)moveBannerOffScreen {
    [UIView animateWithDuration:5 animations:^{
        _addBannerDistanceFromBottomConstraint.constant = -32;
    }];
    bannerIsVisible = FALSE;
}

    [UIView animateWithDuration:5 animations:^{
        _addBannerDistanceFromBottomConstraint.constant = 0;
    }];
    bannerIsVisible = TRUE;
}

And the banner moves, exactly as expected, but no animation.

UPDATE: I re-watched WWDC 12 talk Best Practices for Mastering Auto Layout which covers animation. It discusses how to update constraints using CoreAnimation:


I've tried with the following code, but get the exact same results:
- (void)moveBannerOffScreen {
    _addBannerDistanceFromBottomConstraint.constant = -32;
    [UIView animateWithDuration:2 animations:^{
        [self.view setNeedsLayout];
    }];
    bannerIsVisible = FALSE;
}

- (void)moveBannerOnScreen {
    _addBannerDistanceFromBottomConstraint.constant = 0;
    [UIView animateWithDuration:2 animations:^{
        [self.view setNeedsLayout];
    }];
    bannerIsVisible = TRUE;
}

On a side note, I have checked numerous times and this is being executed on the main thread.

Is there a simple shell command/script that supports excluding certain files/folders from being archived?

I have a directory that need to be archived with a sub directory that has a number of very large files I do not need to backup.

Not quite solutions:

The tar --exclude=PATTERN command matches the given pattern and excludes those files, but I need specific files & folders to be ignored (full file path), otherwise valid files might be excluded.

I could also use the find command to create a list of files and exclude the ones I don't want to archive and pass the list to tar, but that only works with for a small amount of files. I have tens of thousands.

I'm beginning to think the only solution is to create a file with a list of files/folders to be excluded, then use rsync with --exclude-from=file to copy all the files to a tmp directory, and then use tar to archive that directory.

Can anybody think of a better/more efficient solution?

EDIT: Charles Ma's solution works well. The big gotcha is that the --exclude='./folder' MUST be at the beginning of the tar command. Full command (cd first, so backup is relative to that directory):

cd /folder_to_backup
tar --exclude='./folder' --exclude='./upload/folder2' -zcvf /backup/filename.tgz .

30626030	"Can you force a React component to rerender without calling setState?

I have an external (to the component), observable object that I want to listen for changes on. When the object is updated it emits change events, and then I want to rerender the component when any change is detected.

With a top-level React.render this has been possible, but within a component it doesn't work (which makes some sense since the render method just returns an object).

Here's a code example:

export default class MyComponent extends React.Component {

  handleButtonClick() {
    this.render();
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        {Math.random()}

          Click me
        </button>
      </div>
    )
  }
}


Clicking the button internally calls this.render(), but that's not what actually causes the rendering to happen (you can see this in action because the text created by {Math.random()} doesn't change). However, if I simply call this.setState() instead of this.render(), it works fine.

So I guess my question is: do React components need to have state in order to rerender? Is there a way to force the component to update on demand without changing the state?

2619598	"Differences between dependencyManagement and dependencies in Maven

What is the difference between dependencyManagement and dependencies?
I have seen the docs at Apache Maven web site.
It seems that a dependency defined under the dependencyManagement can be used in its child modules without specifying the version.
For example:
A parent project (Pro-par) defines a dependency under the dependencyManagement:
<dependencyManagement>
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>junit</groupId>
      <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
      <version>3.8</version>
    </dependency>
 </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>

Then in the child of Pro-par, I can use the junit:
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>junit</groupId>
    <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>

However, I wonder if it is necessary to define junit in the parent pom? Why not define it directly in the needed module?

32551291	"In CSS Flexbox, why are there no ""justify-items"" and ""justify-self"" properties?

Consider the main axis and cross axis of a flex container:

Source: W3C
To align flex items along the main axis there is one property:

justify-content

To align flex items along the cross axis there are three properties:

align-content
align-items
align-self

In the image above, the main axis is horizontal and the cross axis is vertical. These are the default directions of a flex container.
However, these directions can be easily interchanged with the flex-direction property.
/* main axis is horizontal, cross axis is vertical */
flex-direction: row;
flex-direction: row-reverse;

/* main axis is vertical, cross axis is horizontal */    
flex-direction: column;
flex-direction: column-reverse;

(The cross axis is always perpendicular to the main axis.)
My point in describing how the axes' work is that there doesn't seem to be anything special about either direction. Main axis, cross axis, they're both equal in terms of importance and flex-direction makes it easy to switch back and forth.
So why does the cross axis get two additional alignment properties?
Why are align-content and align-items consolidated into one property for the main axis?
Why does the main axis not get a justify-self property?

Scenarios where these properties would be useful:

placing a flex item in the corner of the flex container
#box3 { align-self: flex-end; justify-self: flex-end; }

making a group of flex items align-right (justify-content: flex-end) but have the first item align left (justify-self: flex-start)


Consider a header section with a group of nav items and a logo. With justify-self the logo could be aligned left while the nav items stay far right, and the whole thing adjusts smoothly (""flexes"") to different screen sizes.

in a row of three flex items, affix the middle item to the center of the container  (justify-content: center) and align the adjacent items to the container edges (justify-self: flex-start and justify-self: flex-end).

Note that values space-around and space-between on
justify-content property  will not keep the middle item centered about the container if the adjacent items have different widths.


#container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  background-color: lightyellow;
}
.box {
  height: 50px;
  width: 75px;
  background-color: springgreen;
}
.box1 {
  width: 100px;
}
.box3 {
  width: 200px;
}
#center {
  text-align: center;
  margin-bottom: 5px;
}
#center > span {
  background-color: aqua;
  padding: 2px;
}
<div id=""center"">
  <span>TRUE CENTER</span>
</div>

<div id=""container"">
  <div class=""box box1""></div>
  <div class=""box box2""></div>
  <div class=""box box3""></div>
</div>

<p>note that the middlebox will only be truly centered if adjacent boxes are equal width</p>



jsFiddle version

As of this writing, there is no mention of justify-self or justify-items in the flexbox spec.
However, in the CSS Box Alignment Module, which is the W3C's unfinished proposal to establish a common set of alignment properties for use across all box models, there is this:

                                                                                                                                                   Source: W3C
You'll notice that justify-self and justify-items are being considered... but not for flexbox.

I'll end by reiterating the main question:

Why are there no ""justify-items"" and ""justify-self"" properties?

3684484	"Peak detection in a 2D array

I'm helping a veterinary clinic measuring pressure under a dogs paw. I use Python for my data analysis and now I'm stuck trying to divide the paws into (anatomical) subregions.
I made a 2D array of each paw, that consists of the maximal values for each sensor that has been loaded by the paw over time. Here's an example of one paw, where I used Excel to draw the areas I want to 'detect'. These are 2 by 2 boxes around the sensor with local maxima's, that together have the largest sum.

So I tried some experimenting and decide to simply look for the maximums of each column and row (can't look in one direction due to the shape of the paw). This seems to 'detect' the location of the separate toes fairly well, but it also marks neighboring sensors.

So what would be the best way to tell Python which of these maximums are the ones I want?
Note: The 2x2 squares can't overlap, since they have to be separate toes!
Also I took 2x2 as a convenience, any more advanced solution is welcome, but I'm simply a human movement scientist, so I'm neither a real programmer or a mathematician, so please keep it 'simple'.
Here's a version that can be loaded with np.loadtxt

Results
So I tried @jextee's solution (see the results below). As you can see, it works very on the front paws, but it works less well for the hind legs.
More specifically, it can't recognize the small peak that's the fourth toe. This is obviously inherent to the fact that the loop looks top down towards the lowest value, without taking into account where this is.
Would anyone know how to tweak @jextee's algorithm, so that it might be able to find the 4th toe too?

Since I haven't processed any other trials yet, I can't supply any other samples. But the data I gave before were the averages of each paw. This file is an array with the maximal data of 9 paws in the order they made contact with the plate.
This image shows how they were spatially spread out over the plate.

Update:
I have set up a blog for anyone interested and I have setup a OneDrive with all the raw measurements. So to anyone requesting more data: more power to you!

New update:
So after the help I got with my questions regarding paw detection and paw sorting, I was finally able to check the toe detection for every paw! Turns out, it doesn't work so well in anything but paws sized like the one in my own example. Off course in hindsight, it's my own fault for choosing the 2x2 so arbitrarily.
Here's a nice example of where it goes wrong: a nail is being recognized as a toe and the 'heel' is so wide, it gets recognized twice!

The paw is too large, so taking a 2x2 size with no overlap, causes some toes to be detected twice. The other way around, in small dogs it often fails to find a 5th toe, which I suspect is being caused by the 2x2 area being too large.
After trying the current solution on all my measurements I came to the staggering conclusion that for nearly all my small dogs it didn't find a 5th toe and that in over 50% of the impacts for the large dogs it would find more!
So clearly I need to change it. My own guess was changing the size of the neighborhood to something smaller for small dogs and larger for large dogs. But generate_binary_structure wouldn't let me change the size of the array.
Therefore, I'm hoping that anyone else has a better suggestion for locating the toes, perhaps having the toe area scale with the paw size?

I'm looking for an optimal way to resize wrapping text in a TextView so that it will fit within its getHeight and getWidth bounds. I'm not simply looking for a way to wrap the text- I want to make sure it both wraps and is small enough to fit entirely on the screen. 

I've seen a few cases on StackOverflow where auto resizing was needed, but they are either very special cases with hack solutions, have no solution, or involve re-drawing the TextView recursively until it is small enough (which is memory intense and forces the user to watch the text shrink step-by-step with every recursion). 

But I'm sure somebody out there has found a good solution that doesn't involve what I'm doing: writing several heavy routines that parse and measure the text, resize the text, and repeat until a suitably small size has been found.

"
24101718	"Swift Beta performance: sorting arrays

I was implementing an algorithm in Swift Beta and noticed that the performance was very poor. After digging deeper I realized that one of the bottlenecks was something as simple as sorting arrays. The relevant part is here:

let n = 1000000
var x =  [Int](repeating: 0, count: n)
for i in 0..<n {
    x[i] = random()
}
// start clock here
let y = sort(x)
// stop clock here


In C++, a similar operation takes 0.06s on my computer.

In Python, it takes 0.6s (no tricks, just y = sorted(x) for a list of integers).

In Swift it takes 6s if I compile it with the following command:

xcrun swift -O3 -sdk `xcrun --show-sdk-path --sdk macosx`


And it takes as much as 88s if I compile it with the following command:

xcrun swift -O0 -sdk `xcrun --show-sdk-path --sdk macosx`


Timings in Xcode with ""Release"" vs. ""Debug"" builds are similar.

What is wrong here? I could understand some performance loss in comparison with C++, but not a 10-fold slowdown in comparison with pure Python.



Edit: weather noticed that changing -O3 to -Ofast makes this code run almost as fast as the C++ version! However, -Ofast changes the semantics of the language a lot — in my testing, it disabled the checks for integer overflows and array indexing overflows. For example, with -Ofast the following Swift code runs silently without crashing (and prints out some garbage):

let n = 10000000
print(n*n*n*n*n)
let x =  [Int](repeating: 10, count: n)
print(x[n])


So -Ofast is not what we want; the whole point of Swift is that we have the safety nets in place. Of course, the safety nets have some impact on the performance, but they should not make the programs 100 times slower. Remember that Java already checks for array bounds, and in typical cases, the slowdown is by a factor much less than 2. And in Clang and GCC we have got -ftrapv for checking (signed) integer overflows, and it is not that slow, either.

Hence the question: how can we get reasonable performance in Swift without losing the safety nets?



Edit 2: I did some more benchmarking, with very simple loops along the lines of

for i in 0..<n {
    x[i] = x[i] ^ 12345678
}


(Here the xor operation is there just so that I can more easily find the relevant loop in the assembly code. I tried to pick an operation that is easy to spot but also ""harmless"" in the sense that it should not require any checks related to integer overflows.)

Again, there was a huge difference in the performance between -O3 and -Ofast. So I had a look at the assembly code:


With -Ofast I get pretty much what I would expect. The relevant part is a loop with 5 machine language instructions.
With -O3 I get something that was beyond my wildest imagination. The inner loop spans 88 lines of assembly code. I did not try to understand all of it, but the most suspicious parts are 13 invocations of ""callq _swift_retain"" and another 13 invocations of ""callq _swift_release"". That is, 26 subroutine calls in the inner loop!




Edit 3: In comments, Ferruccio asked for benchmarks that are fair in the sense that they do not rely on built-in functions (e.g. sort). I think the following program is a fairly good example:

let n = 10000
var x = [Int](repeating: 1, count: n)
for i in 0..<n {
    for j in 0..<n {
        x[i] = x[j]
    }
}


There is no arithmetic, so we do not need to worry about integer overflows. The only thing that we do is just lots of array references. And the results are here—Swift -O3 loses by a factor almost 500 in comparison with -Ofast:


C++ -O3: 0.05 s
C++ -O0: 0.4 s
Java: 0.2 s
Python with PyPy: 0.5 s
Python: 12 s
Swift -Ofast: 0.05 s
Swift -O3: 23 s
Swift -O0: 443 s


(If you are concerned that the compiler might optimize out the pointless loops entirely, you can change it to e.g. x[i] ^= x[j], and add a print statement that outputs x[0]. This does not change anything; the timings will be very similar.)

And yes, here the Python implementation was a stupid pure Python implementation with a list of ints and nested for loops. It should be much slower than unoptimized Swift. Something seems to be seriously broken with Swift and array indexing.



Edit 4: These issues (as well as some other performance issues) seems to have been fixed in Xcode 6 beta 5.

For sorting, I now have the following timings:


clang++ -O3: 0.06 s
swiftc -Ofast: 0.1 s
swiftc -O: 0.1 s
swiftc: 4 s


For nested loops:


clang++ -O3: 0.06 s
swiftc -Ofast: 0.3 s
swiftc -O: 0.4 s
swiftc: 540 s


It seems that there is no reason anymore to use the unsafe -Ofast (a.k.a. -Ounchecked); plain -O produces equally good code.

There's a command to list images, docker images, but there doesn't seem to be a corresponding docker containers.

Other than becoming root and looking into /var/lib/docker there doesn't seem a way to do that. Am I missing something? Is that something one isn't supposed to do?

62653114	"How can I deal with this Git warning? ""Pulling without specifying how to reconcile divergent branches is discouraged""

After a git pull origin master, I get the following message:
warning: Pulling without specifying how to reconcile divergent branches is
discouraged. You can squelch this message by running one of the following
commands sometime before your next pull:

  git config pull.rebase false  # merge (the default strategy)
  git config pull.rebase true   # rebase
  git config pull.ff only       # fast-forward only

You can replace ""git config"" with ""git config --global"" to set a default
preference for all repositories. You can also pass --rebase, --no-rebase,
or --ff-only on the command line to override the configured default per
invocation.

2318777	"Undo a particular commit in Git that's been pushed to remote repos

What is the simplest way to undo a particular commit that is:


not in the head or HEAD
Has been pushed to the remote.


Because if it is not the latest commit, 

git reset HEAD


doesn't work. And because it has been pushed to a remote,

git rebase -i


and

git rebase --onto


will cause some problem in the remotes. 

More so, I don't want to modify the history really. If there was bad code, it was there in the history and can be seen. I just want it out in the working copy, and I don't mind a reverse merge commit.

In other words, what is the Git equivalent of the following svn commands:

svn merge -r 303:295 http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/trunk


which removes all changes from 295 to 302 by reverse merging all changes in those revisions, as a new commit.

svn merge -c -302 ^/trunk


which undoes the 302 commit, of course by adding another commit that reverse merges the changes from that respective commit.

I thought it should be a fairly simple operation in Git and a fairly common use case. What else is the point of atomic commits? 

We have staging stashing and all to ensure the commits are perfectly atomic, shouldn't you be able to undo one or more of those atomic commits easily?

I'm trying to POST a JSON object using fetch.
